1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,620
谁能给我澄清一下
Clarify something for me.

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,170
聚餐的精髓难道不该在于
Isn't the point of a communal meal

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,670
互相交换看法和主张吗
the exchange of ideas and opinions?

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,910
这难道不该是讨论今日大事的时刻吗
An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,890
是啊
It is.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,220
但是每当你威胁要将
You just kind of put a damper on things

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
边吃边说的人至于死地之后
when you said, "The next person I see talking

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
我们就全无兴致了
with food in their mouth will be put to death."

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
如果要深究谁说了什么的话  我们能纠结一整晚
Well, we could argue about who said what all night long,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,960
但为了回到正轨上
but to set things back on course,

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
我要为聚餐开启个新的话题了
I will propose a new topic of conversation.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,570
不得了了
Great.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,790
最棒的数字是哪一个
What is the best number?

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,990
多说一句  答案是唯一的
By the way, there's only one correct answer.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,740
五百三十一万八千零八
5,318,008?

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,180
错误
Wrong.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,540
最棒的数字是73
The best number is 73.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,030
你们估计会疑惑原因
You're probably wondering why.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
没没  我们没有
No. Uh-uh. We're good.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,650
73是第21个质数
73 is the 21st prime number.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,720
而它反过来说  37是第12个质数  而它再反过来21
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21,

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,230
则是构成73的两个数字
is the product of multiplying--

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,830
高潮来了  也就是7和3相乘的结果
hang on to your hats-- seven and three.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,620
怎么着  怎么着  我说错没
Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,860
我们懂了
We get it.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,040
73就是数字界的查克·诺里斯
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
查克·诺里斯:美国著名武术家

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,310
那是对查克·诺里斯的褒奖
Chuck Norris wishes.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
同时73用二进制表示的结果
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,000
是1-0-0-1-0-0-1
"one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one"

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
所以它反过来念是1-0-0-1-0-0-1
which backwards is "one-zero- zero-one-zero zero one"

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
两者是一致的
exactly the same.

32
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,640
而把查克·诺里斯的名字反着念是"Sirron Kcuhc"[无意义]
All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,850
我插一句
Just for the record,

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,820
如果你把5318008输进计算器后
when you enter 5,318,008 on a calculator,

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,870
它倒过来显示拼写的单词是"咪咪"
upside-down it spells "boobies""

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,530
记得你曾疑惑过为何
Remember when you were wondering

37
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,150
女生们晚上不想跟我们一起吃吗
why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,960
是啊  我现在懂了
Yeah, I get it now.

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,990
我喜欢你的心形小吊坠  伯纳黛特
I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,850
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,240
是霍华德送我的
Howard gave it to me.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,450
这是最好玩儿的事了
It's the cutest thing.

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,240
每当我跟他妈妈共进晚餐后
Every time I have dinner with his mom,

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,480
隔天总会收到他送我的首饰
the next day I get jewelry.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,980
你们知道人们情人节送的这种心形符号
Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,060
其实它的原型并不是人的心脏
is not actually based on the shape of a human heart,

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,590
而是女性弯腰时显露的臀部形状吗
but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,910
也就是说我的七年级
Oh, so I spent seventh grade

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,830
一直都用的小屁股作为点缀了是吧
dotting my I's with little asses?

50
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,020
酷啊
Cool.

51
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,910
你好啊  佩妮  最近过得如何
Hey, Penny, how's it going?

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,350
你好啊  扎克  你来这做什么呢
Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?

53
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,670
我爸的公司为这家店印制菜单
My dad's company prints the menus for this place.

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,620
我来送些过塑了的新版本
I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated.

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,240
这样吐在上面以后容易打扫一点
Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em.

56
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,470
猜猜我怎么想到的点子
Guess how I got the idea?

57
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,440
好了好了  我懂的
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

58
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
扎克  这是我的朋友们  伯纳黛特和艾米
Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,220
-你好啊  -你好
- Hi. - Hey.

60
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,760
呼~
Hoo.

61
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,080
很高兴再见到你
Okay, well, it was good to see you.

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,690
我也是
Yeah, you, too.

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
他好帅啊  你俩怎么认识的
He's really cute. How do you know him?

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,650
我们约会过几次
Oh, we went out a couple of times.

65
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,590
我总被时下的表达方式所迷惑
I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

66
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,220
约会过是不是总代表着交媾过
Does "went out" mean "had intercourse"?

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,340
-是的  -不是  不是的
- Yes. - No, no.

68
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,060
但这次  是的
But in this case, yes.

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,500
有意思
Interesting.

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,900
是不是过程不太满意啊
And was it not satisfactory?

71
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,840
不  其实还不错
No, it was great.

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
只是他没有在智商层面上给我压力
He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,140
你不能将就一下他  然后一起去听听NPR吗
Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
NPR:美国公共电台

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,020
没用的  扎克连NPR的全称都拼不出来
Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.

75
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,540
我跟霍华德相处就是这么做的
It's what I do with Howard.

76
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,070
我比他要聪明
I'm much smarter than he is.

77
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,560
但保护他的男子气概是很重要的
But it's important to protect his manhood.

78
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,230
呼~
Hoo.

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,210
你怎么了
What's the matter?

80
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,760
我只是突感气血涌动
I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,020
我的心率加速  掌心冒汗
My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy,

82
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,290
口干舌燥
my mouth is dry.

83
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,450
还有  我只是不由自主地想说"呼~"
In addition, I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,490
我想我们明白发生了什么  是吧
Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?

85
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,840
毫无疑问
It's no mystery.

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,970
我明显是患有感冒
I obviously have the flu

87
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,030
及其突发性妥瑞综合症
coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.
妥瑞症:运动协调性疾患

88

生活大爆炸第四季第十集

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,260
听说生物试验室发生的事故了吗
Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?

94
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,380
-没  -发生了什么事
- No. - What happened?

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,110
他们给老鼠注射了放射性同位素
They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes

96
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,410
但其中的一名技术员被咬了
and one of the techs got bit.

97
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,500
那他得到了超能力吗
Did he get superpowers?

98
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,420
没  他被缝了五针外加一针破伤风针剂
No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.

99
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,900
太令人失望了
Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

100
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,340
为何这么说
Why?

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,800
如果你在试验室被放射性动物咬伤
Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab,

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
你肯定想成为超级英雄的
you kind of want to turn into a superhero.

103
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,890
但谁又想变成鼠魔侠呢
Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?

104
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,820
谁不想啊
Who wouldn't?

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,040
你可以在迷宫里横冲直撞
You could zip through a maze in nothing flat,

106
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
钻进很小的地洞
squeeze through really small holes,

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,530
而且只要蹦跶几下就能让餐馆关门
and shut down restaurants in a single bound.

108
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,020
而且最棒的是  如果我是鼠魔侠
And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man,

109
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,360
你就可以当我的跟班  鼠娃
you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.

110
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,100
鼠娃
Mouse Boy?

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,210
你不喜欢鼠娃吗
You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

112
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,740
那害虫娃呢
How about "Kid Vermin"?

113
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,770
首先  要是我们真有超能力
First of all, if we had superpowers,

114
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,320
我肯定不会是跟班  你才是跟班
I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,940
鼠魔侠才不会是跟班呢
Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

116
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,750
莱纳德  你说句公道话
Leonard, settle this.

117
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,180
我们俩  谁更像跟班
Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?

118
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,010
没错  莱纳德  你说是谁
Yeah, Leonard, who?

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,500
高中毕业十二年了  我还是悲催地混在书呆子帮里
12 years after high school, and I'm still at the nerd table.

120
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,460
你是不是把这个人的脑子切得太薄了点
Aren't you slicing that man's brain a little too thin?

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,620
我这要是在奎兹诺餐厅
It's too thin if I were making

122
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,500
做英尺人脑三明治的话  就的确是切太薄了
a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos.

123
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,430
但是放在双光子显微镜下检验的话  就不算薄
For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,630
好吧  你是专家
Well, you're the expert.

125
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,770
如果胡来才是正确的方法的话  那我闭嘴
If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.

126
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,530
很好
Very well.

127
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,240
如果你死后将遗体捐献给科学研究的话
If you die and donate your body to science,

128
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
我保证我会把你的大脑切得跟加拿大培根一样厚
I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.

129
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,000
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,360
如果你不介意的话
Now, if you'll excuse me,

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,320
我要量一下我的体温
I have to take my temperature.

132
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
你是在监控你的生理节奏
Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms

133
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,340
以确定你脑部活动最旺盛的时段吗
in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity?

134
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,640
我曾经在某个暑假试过
I did that one summer.

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,600
美好的童年啊
Ah, youth.

136
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,510
不是  我昨晚产生了一些奇怪的症状
No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night,

137
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,270
所以我每个小时都在检查自己的生命迹象
so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.

138
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,120
我很乐意帮你做个图表
I'd be happy to create a chart

139
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
进行一下差异分析
and participate in a differential diagnosis.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,480
好像挺好玩的嘛
Oh, that sounds like fun.

141
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,500
开始吧
All right.

142
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,780
你有哪些症状
What were the symptoms?

143
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,460
心跳加速  手心出汗  口干舌燥
Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth

144
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,220
还有局部的血管抽动
and localized vascular throbbing.

145
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,190
局部是哪
Localized to what region?

146
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,430
耳朵和生殖器
Ears and genitalia.

147
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,920
有意思
Interesting.

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,750
是两个通常不会放一起说的器官
Not body parts that usually team up.

149
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,550
那环境因素呢
What about environmental factors?

150
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,610
形容一下当时的情景
Describe the scene for me.

151
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,680
我跟佩妮还有伯纳黛特一起在餐馆
I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette,

152
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,180
喝水  而且喝的是碳酸水  因为那是特殊场合
drinking water -- carbonated as it was a special occasion.

153
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,820
佩妮的朋友扎克过来打了个招呼
Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello

154
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,890
然后我就说"呼"[和"谁"同音]
and I said "hoo."

155
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,680
谁
Who?

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,370
扎克
Zack.

157
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,220
你知道是扎克还问
Then why did you ask?

158
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,120
-问什么  -问"谁"呀
- Ask what?  - Who.

159
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,750
扎克
Zack.

160
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,610
好吧  重头来一遍
All right, let's start over.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,210
扎克走过来后你说了什么
What did you say when Zack walked in?

162
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,180
-"呼"["谁"]  -扎克
- "Hoo".  - Zack.

163
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,440
你为什么一直说"扎克"
Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,150
因为你一直问"谁"["呼"]呀
Because you keep saying "who."

165
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,370
我现在可没说"呼"
I'm not saying "hoo" now.

166
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,890
我是昨晚说的"呼"
I said "hoo" last night.

167
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,690
答案就是扎克  对吧
And the answer was Zack, correct?

168
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,780
我没问问题啊
There was no question.

169
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,790
我只是说了"呼"
I simply said "hoo."

170
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,060
好吧  我不纠结了
All right, I think I have enough to go on.

171
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,190
你以上症状的诱因
Possible explanations for your symptoms are,

172
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,200
根据可能性降序排列的结果如下
in descending order of likelihood:

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,340
甲亢  过早绝经
hyperthyroidism, premature menopause,

174
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,570
外星人附体  或是
hosting an alien parasite or --

175
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,410
以下这个结果纯粹是为了涵盖所有
and I only include it for the sake of covering

176
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,150
可能因素  那就是性冲动
absolutely all bases -- sexual arousal.

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,720
我在哪儿被外星人附的身啊
Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?

178
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,270
找到你了
There you are.

179
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,470
问你个问题  你最怕什么
Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?

180
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,690
我也不知道
I don't know. Um...

181
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,770
核战
nuclear war.

182
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,530
不小心被活埋了
Accidentally being buried alive.

183
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,150
或者是像那种电影情节一样  突然接到一个电话
Any of those movies where you get that phone call

184
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,660
电话那头的人说你就要死了
that says you're going to die.

185
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,590
结果你还就真挂了
And then you do.

186
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,430
不是这些  是某个
No. Something very specific

187
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,680
咱俩都知道你
that we both know you,

188
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,070
也就是拉杰·库萨帕里  害怕的东西
Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.

189
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,610
我家的确有二型糖尿病史
Well, type two diabetes runs in my family.

190
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,470
糖尿病后期会掉脚趾的
The thought of losing a toe...

191
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,120
是蜘蛛  你怕蜘蛛
Spiders! You're afraid of spiders!

192
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,190
这是什么
What the heck is this?

193
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,770
当然是装着一只大蜘蛛的罐子啦
A jar with a big spider in it, of course.

194
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,480
勇敢度测试
Bravery test.

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,470
先把手拿出来的人就是跟班
First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.

196
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,310
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

197
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,160
也许吧
Perhaps.

198
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,510
你怕了吗
Are you scared?

199
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,330
没有  但这测试很白痴
No. But it's a stupid test.

200
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,530
是吗  要是地球危在旦夕
Oh, really? What if the Earth was in danger

201
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,640
而唯一拯救的方法就是
and the only way to save it was

202
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,860
把你的手伸进装着蜘蛛的罐子里呢
to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?

203
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,050
是吗  要是地球危在旦夕
Oh, yeah? What if the Earth was in danger

204
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,760
而唯一的拯救办法就是
and the only way to save it was to take a shower

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,790
在更衣室里洗澡  还被人看到你的裸体
in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?

206
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,980
得了  这事没可能发生
Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen.

207
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,280
快把手放进罐子里
Put your hand in the jar

208
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,600
不然你就一辈子做我跟班吧
or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

209
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,540
好吧  这就放
All right, I will.

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,080
你怎么一下子胆儿这么肥了
How did you get so brave all of a sudden?

211
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,370
简单
It's easy.

212
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,990
蜘蛛都爬到你手臂上了
The spider's crawling up your arm.

213
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,640
快把这货弄下来
Get it off! Get it off!

214
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,290
快点  拉杰
Please, Raj!

215
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,510
别愣着
Please.

216
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,290
我的血检表明甲状腺功能正常
My blood work shows thyroid function normal.

217
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,050
皮质醇水平也正常
Cortisol levels normal.

218
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,580
那你的垂体卵泡刺激素水平呢
How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?

219
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,000
谢尔顿  我还没到更年期
Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.

220
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,830
你确定吗
Are you sure?

221
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,160
你这口气听着像个暴躁的欧巴桑
You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.

222
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,410
我觉得我们得面对一个残酷的现实
I think we need to face the cold, hard truth:

223
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,740
我被佩妮的朋友扎克性唤起了
I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.

224
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,240
慢着  我觉得
Hang on. I don't know

225
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,590
我们还没考虑过外星人附体的可能性呢
that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis

226
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,400
这个合理假设
a fair shake.

227
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,990
我们还是有点逻辑吧
Let's look at this logically.

228
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,020
我有胃  所以会饿
I have a stomach; I get hungry.

229
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,880
我有生殖器  所以也可能会有性冲动
I have genitals; I have the potential for sexual arousal.

230
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,350
这是我们必须承受的负担
A cross we all must bear.

231
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,240
每次我遭遇这种艰难时刻
You know, in difficult moments like this,

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,270
我总是借助更强大的力量约束自己
I often turn to a force greater than myself.

233
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,040
宗教信仰吗
Religion?

234
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,570
《星际迷航》
Star Trek.

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,650
你看过《星舰迷航记I》吗
Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

236
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,330
-没有  -别看了  烂得要死  但是...
- No. Don't. - It's terrible. However...

237
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,870
在这部电影里我们知道
in it, we learn that

238
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,050
当史波克发现自己丧失了理性逻辑
when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic

239
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,980
而被他人类那部分的情绪所影响
by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them

240
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,190
他就用瓦肯族科里纳心律原则压抑自己
using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

241
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,730
你的意思是  我们的人生要受
Are you suggesting we live our lives

242
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,400
不入流的科幻作品里的思想的影响吗
guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,730
不入流的科幻作品
"Cheap science fiction"?

244
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,080
你在做什么
What are you doing?

245
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,800
用科里纳规则来压抑我因为上个评论所产生的愤怒
Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.

246
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,830
你现在对我这么在意
Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment

247
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,250
会不会就是因为嫉妒作祟
is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?

248
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,280
这我倒没想过
I hadn't considered that.

249
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,440
稍等片刻
Give me a moment.

250
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,070
好了  我想过了
All right, I've considered it.

251
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,570
-然后呢  -驳回这一说法
- And? - I reject it.

252
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,400
是因为你没感觉到嫉妒
You reject it because you don't feel jealousy,

253
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,010
还是因为你压抑掉了
or because you are suppressing jealousy?

254
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,720
我想我还是回家吃午餐吧
I think I'll eat my lunch at home.

255
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,900
那不是你的午餐  谢尔顿
That's not your lunch, Sheldon;

256
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,280
那些是尸体的大脑标本
those are the cadaver brain specimens.

257
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,450
就因为你切片切得不对
As they were incorrectly sliced,

258
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,920
害得我都把它们当成生鱼片了
you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.

259
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,470
-你好  -好啊
- Hello. - Hey.

260
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,860
你不是都明天洗衣服的吗
Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?

261
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,170
我常用的柔软剂超市卖光了
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener.

262
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,610
如果这一款过柔或不够柔
If this one under-or over-softens,

263
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,940
我得花时间处理
I'll need time to make things right.

264
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,370
真会未雨绸缪
That's thinking ahead.

265
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,560
换句话说是怎么早没想到
The alternative would be to think backwards.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,960
这下记住了
That's just remembering.

267
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,480
艾米怎么样了
So how's Amy?

268
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,670
艾米变了
Amy's changed.

269
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,900
也许我该放手了
I might have to let her go.

270
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,800
哦不  为什么啊
Oh, no. Why?

271
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,300
我以为她是个高度进化的
I thought she was a highly evolved creature

272
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,760
纯高智商物种  就像我
of pure intellect, like me.

273
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
而最近的事件表明
But recent events indicate that

274
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
她也许不过是个屈服于低级欲望的生物
she may be a slave to her baser urges.

275
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,200
就像你
Like you.

276
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,520
这句侮辱我就当没听到吧
Just going to skip over that insult.

277
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,380
什么侮辱
What insult?

278
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,540
没错  所以我才要假装没听到
Yeah! That's why I'm going to skip over it.

279
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,290
你是说艾米她...
Are you saying that Amy is...

280
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,480
用科学的话怎么说来着...
oh, what's the scientific word...

281
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,810
别提科学了  她就是很饥渴
Forget science. She's horny.

282
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,750
好吧  哎呀
Oh! Okay. Wow.

283
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,900
完全是生理上的需求  我无能为力
It's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.

284
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,830
你确定吗
Are you sure?

285
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,760
你这是什么意思
What are you suggesting?

286
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,540
我的意思是  也许你可以对
I'm suggesting there might be something

287
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,180
艾米的欲望  做点什么
you could do about... Amy's urges?

288
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,150
切除人的卵巢是犯法的
It's illegal to spay a human being.

289
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,870
好吧  我不是这意思
Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.

290
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,980
你是说我自己可以做什么
You mean... something I could do.

291
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,500
一点没错
Exactly.

292
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,970
好吧  我一直想避免这么做
Well, I was hoping to avoid this.

293
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,880
但我想还是勉为其难一下吧
But I might as well get it over with.

294
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,650
谢谢  佩妮
Thank you, Penny.

295
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,200
我会告知你结果的
I'll let you know what happens.

296
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,830
哎呀  艾米  你真是个幸运儿
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

297
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,500
你好  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

298
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,550
请问你是扎克·强生吗
Is this the Zack Johnson

299
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,980
和我邻居佩妮交媾的那个
who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny?

300
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,200
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to bother you.

301
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,170
你好  我想找扎克·强生
Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson

302
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,700
曾和我邻居佩妮交媾的那位
who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny.

303
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,200
交媾  就是性交
Coitus. It means intercourse.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,020
我有预感你就是我要找的那位扎克
And I have a feeling I'm speaking to the right Zack.

305
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,950
我是谢尔顿·库珀
This is Sheldon Cooper.

306
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,060
好吧  就是谢利
Fine. Shelly.

307
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,620
对  确实很像女孩名
Yes, that does sound like a girl's name.

308
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,790
不  我不觉得困扰
No, it doesn't bother me.

309
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,030
对  叫我"臭谢利"我确实很困扰
Yes, "Smelly Shelly" does bother me.

310
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,570
我告诉你我为啥打给你
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

311
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,510
我想知道你是否有兴趣
I'd like to know if you'd be interested

312
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,740
跟艾米·菲拉·福勒性交
in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler.

313
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,180
艾米·菲拉·福勒
Amy Farrah Fowler.

314
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,930
没错  这确实是个女孩
Yes, that is a girl's name.

315
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,710
天哪  简直就是对牛弹琴
Good grief. It's like trying to talk to a dolphin.

316
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,900
坑爹呐
Really?

317
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,110
这样来决定谁是英雄  谁是跟班
This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick?

318
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,780
你有更好的主意
You got a better idea?

319
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,130
随便哪个主意都比这好
Every idea is better than this idea.

320
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,250
叮
Ding!

321
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,790
-等等  叮什么叮  -这是铃声
- Wait. What the hell is "ding"?  - It's a bell.

322
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,220
我可不觉得摔跤比赛是用铃的
I don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell.

323
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
好吧  你说怎么着
Fine. How do you want to start?

324
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,890
不然我们喊一二三开始
I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?

325
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,120
一二三开始  那是小孩子用的
One-two-three-go? That's for babies.

326
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,310
好吧  不然这样...
Okay, how about, uh...

327
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,730
各就各位  预备  开始
on your mark, get set, go?

328
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,420
那是赛跑用的  你想跑吗
That's for a footrace. If you want to race,

329
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,350
那还得出去跑
we have to go outside.

330
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,060
不  外面太冷了  我没穿外套
No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.

331
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,150
搞什么名堂
Oh, for crying out loud.

332
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,320
哪门子超级英雄还需要外套啊
What kind of superhero needs a jacket?

333
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,060
那你告诉我哪门子英雄会说  "那件红色紧身衣是我的"
What kind of superhero says, "Dibs on the red tights!

334
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,700
"那件红色紧身衣是我的"
Dibs on the red tights!"

335
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,210
那这样吧  预备  摔跤
All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.

336
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,130
等等  现在就开始吗  还是等真的开始时
Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say

337
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,980
-再说这句话  -现在就开始
- when we do start, or...  - We're starting now!

338
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,650
别冲我嚷嚷
Don't yell at me!

339
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,820
假设还有比这更糟糕的方法耗过周五的夜晚
Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night.

340
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,960
完全想不到啊
None come to mind.

341
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,940
看看他们盖的这戳  谁允许他们
Look at this stamp. On what authority

342
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,660
在顾客进门时往他们手上盖印子的
are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?

343
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,100
肯定洗得掉的
I'm sure it'll wash off.

344
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,540
今晚总算还有点安慰
Little comfort tonight.

345
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,520
我看着像地狱天使
I look like a Hell's Angel.

346
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,630
扎克在那
There's Zack.

347
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,690
你确定真的想这么做吗
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

348
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,710
不是我想做
It's not what I want to do;

349
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,980
而是不得不做
it's what I have to do.

350
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,070
去吧  艾米·菲拉·福勒
Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

351
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,070
遵循自己内分泌系统的呼唤
Follow your endocrine system.

352
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,350
谢谢  谢尔顿  你真是好朋友
Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.

353
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,330
区区小忙不足挂齿
Please don't drag this out.

354
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,650
这玩意肯定洗不掉
This is never going to come off.

355
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,920
打扰一下
Excuse me?

356
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,680
扎克  我是艾米·菲拉·福勒  那晚见过的
Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night.

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,240
我一直在追求着纯粹的知识
I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge.

358
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
直到遇到了你  才合理理性地决定
Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason

359
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,130
站在你面前的  是130磅沸腾的雌性激素
And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen,

360
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,430
渴望着抱住你的臀大肌
longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus

361
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,920
来一场莎士比亚所比喻的
and make Shakespeare's metaphorical

362
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,080
禽兽一样的勾当
beast with two backs.

363
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,320
我的臀什么
My gluteus what?

364
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,270
另一方面
On the other hand,

365
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,480
看到你这一片空白傻瓜似的表情
as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face,

366
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,820
柯里纳:《星舰迷航》中瓦肯人去除感情的过程
我又决定去培养瓦肯人"柯里纳"的习惯
I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

367
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,320
-再见  扎克  -再见
- Good-bye, Zack. - Bye.

368
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,030
呼~~
Hoo.

369
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,620
这样够我支撑一会了
That should hold me for a while.

370
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,360
法律上我有义务提醒你
I'm legally obligated to inform you

371
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,310
我11岁时上过空手道课程
that I took a karate lesson when I was 11.

372
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,840
要是我妈安排好搭车的事
I'd be a regular ninja by now

373
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,550
我现在早就是一合格的忍者了
if my mom could've arranged a carpool.

374
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
是吗
Oh, yeah?

375
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,680
我在健身中心上过普拉提课程
Well, I've been taking Pilates class at the rec center,

376
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,610
我的腹肌就跟哈希巧克力块儿一样
and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.

377
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,250
是吗  没关系  反正你输定了
Oh, yeah? Won't matter, you're going down!

378
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,940
不  你才输定了
No, uh-uh, you're going down!

379
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,480
有人输的话  肯定是你
If anybody's going to go down, it's going to be you.

380
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,740
伙计们  都30分钟了  你们还没碰过对方
Fellas. It's been 30 minutes. Nobody's touched each other.

381
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,210
很高兴你决定驳回你的动物本能
I'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain

382
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,720
回到纯粹智力的领域
and return to the realm of pure intellect.

383
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,130
我也是
As am I.

384
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,480
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

385
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,460
做个实验
An experiment.

386
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,860
没  没什么  算了
Nope. Nothing. Never mind.

387
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,950
你知道你赢不了的吧
You realize you can't win.

388
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,090
我宁愿相信  我输不了
I prefer to think that I can't lose.

389
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,750
你错了
You're wrong.

390
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,840
那只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time

391
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,350
你迟早会落入鼠魔侠的捕鼠器的
before you fall into Rat-Man's rat trap.

392
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,370
你个可悲的笨蛋
You pathetic fool!

393
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,100
有捕鼠器的话  难道不会抓到鼠魔侠么
If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

394
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,860
我没表达好
Just because I didn't express myself well

395
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,130
不代表我的观点也不对
doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid!

396
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,430
你个喋喋不休的小丑
You bloviating buffoon!

397
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,460
你个自恋的脑残
You narcissistic nincompoop!

398
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,380
你个红鬼懦夫
You crimson coward!

399
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,290
莱纳德  醒醒
Oh, Leonard, wake up,

400
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,400
你错过了不少超级英雄的精彩名言了
you're missing some very excellent superhero quips.
