4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,610
慢着
Not so fast.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,470
无敌谢尔顿
Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,380
无敌谢尔顿
Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,370
是的  "无敌谢尔顿"能击败其他所有牌
Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,640
而且没有违背自制卡牌的规则
and does not violate the rule against homemade cards

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,000
因为这规则是我在工作时发明的
because I made it at work.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,640
你明白为何别人都不想跟你一起玩吗
Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,980
不明白
No...

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,180
虽然我从幼儿园开始就一直被问这个问题
Although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,910
你的《科学》杂志寄到了我的邮箱里
Hey, your copy of Science Magazine was in my mailbox.

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,050
哦  谢了
Oh, thanks. Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,750
看啊  这期讲的都是关于星球的内容
Check it out, all about planets this month.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,770
这是颗原子
That's an atom.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,800
各抒己见嘛
Agree to disagree.

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,350
这就是我喜爱科学的原因
That's what I love about science.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,420
因为总没有正确的答案
There's no one right answer.

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,430
那么...
So...

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,600
你和扎克又在一起了吗
You and Zack again, huh?

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,750
是啊  我和扎克又在一起了
Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,810
我俩之前来过吗
Were we here earlier?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,480
好吧  我看我们还是走吧
Okay, we should, we should go.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,350
等下
Ah, not yet.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,540
我还想和这帮捣腾科学的小子聊聊科学呢
I want to talk science with the science dudes.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,840
好棒哦  科学小子们要和你聊科学了
Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you.

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,680
你想聊点啥呢
What do you want to talk about,

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,600
岩石  恐龙还是我们的好朋友海狸呢
rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,440
我在探索频道看过件妙事
You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,590
原来海星一旦被杀
Turns out that if you kill a starfish,

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,500
它会立刻复活
it'll just come back to life.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,190
那海星没穿拳击短裤吧
Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts?

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,960
也许你看的是尼克频道[儿童频道]
Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,390
不  我比较确定看的是探索频道
No, I'm almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,060
那是个不错的节目
It was a great show.

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,850
节目还说海豚可能比人还聪明
They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,990
海豚可能比某些人聪明
They might be smarter than some people.

39
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,540
也许我们可以做个试验看看
Maybe we can do an experiment to find out.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,840
这很容易
That's easy enough.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,090
我们找一缸水  找个海豚能穿过去的铁圈
We'd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through,

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,470
再找一桶你喜欢吃的饵料就行了
and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.

43
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,520
我没听懂
I don't get it.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,930
海豚可能懂
A dolphin might.

45
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,150
我明白了
Oh, I see.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,790
你们是说我傻是吧
You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,350
你这就错了
That's not correct.

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,720
我们是在暗喻
We were implying it.

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,250
是你自己说出来的
You then inferred it.

50
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,990
我们走
Let's go.

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
有这样一群人
You know, for a group of guys

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,250
一辈子可能都会被别人羞辱欺负着
who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied,

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,790
你们就是那羞辱人的混蛋
you can be real jerks.

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,690
为你们感到羞耻
Shame on all of you.

55
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,390
我什么都没做过啊
What the hell did I do?

56
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,150
你笑了
You laughed.

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,820

生活大爆炸第四季第十一集

62
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,260
你们也认同佩妮的说法吗
Do you think Penny's right?

63
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,000
我们刚才是在欺负扎克吗
Were we bullying Zack?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,730
不  我知道什么叫欺负
No, I know bullying.

65
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,460
他刚才走得很淡定  内裤也好端端地在屁股上呢
He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.

66
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,710
而且也没人把鸡鸡画到他额头上啊
And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.

67
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,790
有人画到过你额头上吗
That happened to you?

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,130
我去板球训练营的第一天
First day of cricket camp.

69
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,920
他们就是想拿我的俩眼睛当蛋蛋
They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.

70
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,300
我觉得我们还是得跟那家伙道个歉
I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,850
-那你去道歉呗  -为什么是我去
- So go apologize. - Why me?

72
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,490
你开的头  我们只是附和罢了
You started it, we just piled on.

73
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,830
那我该怎么说
What would I even say?

74
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,630
扎克  很抱歉  你太蠢了
Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

75
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,250
吃点奶球吧
Have a Milk Dud.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
奶球
A Milk Dud?

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,260
是的  凭借奶球这自嘲的名字
Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,130
外加温和的口味
and remarkably mild flavor,

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,260
是盒装糖果里最能表达歉意的
are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.

80
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,630
我有个好主意
I got a better idea.

81
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,480
这事儿我们都有责任
We're all responsible.

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,050
所以都该去道歉
I say we all go.

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,160
拜托  谁跟我一起去一下呢
Come on, who's with me?

84

跟我去的我赠送漫画书  谁想去一下呢
Free comic books to anyone who comes with me.

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,500

I might get punched. You really want to miss that?

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,700
薄荷糖也挺有道歉味道的
Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.

87
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,800
你这是在自取其辱
You're embarrassing yourself.

88
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,720
佩妮
Penny.

89
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,190
-什么事  -我们想跟扎克说两句  扎克你还好吗
- What? - Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.

90
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,520
你们想怎么样
What do you want?

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,130
我们之前说的那些
Listen, the stuff we were saying before,

92
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,850
只不过是跟你开玩笑来着
we were just kidding around.

93
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,580
才不是呢
No, you weren't.

94
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,140
你们刚才在嘲讽我
You were making fun of me.

95
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,000
拜托  我们经常这样的

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,340
互相找不痛快
We give each other a hard time.

97
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,260
喂  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon,

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,400
你长得像在祈祷的螳螂
you look like a praying mantis.

99
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,670
你这话太伤人了
That's very hurtful.

100
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,260
看到了吧
See?

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,090
我不知道  还是觉得很不爽
I don't know, it still wasn't very nice.

102
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,190
奶球要吗
Milk Dud?

103
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,830
爱死奶球了
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

我们正打算去漫画书店呢

我有整整一百万年
I haven't been to a comic book store

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,360
没去过漫画书店了

112
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,800
真的吗
Literally?

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
是字面上理解的一百万年吗
Literally a million years?

114
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,480
打住
Don't.

115
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,980
-你想和他们一起去吗  -不想
- You want to go with 'em?  - No.

- Okay, see you later.  - Wait,

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,990
等等  你为了去漫画书店就丢下我吗
w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me to go look at comic books?

118
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,400
你生我气了吗
Are you mad at me?

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,280
我不高兴了
I'm not happy.

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,050

哇  这地方太赞了

Where do they keep the Archies?

In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.

124
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,490
你说的那是老阿奇漫画
Oh, no, you're thinking old-school Archie.

125
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,250
现在已经成熟多了
It's much more sophisticated now.

126

比如说  有两个宇宙
Like, there's two universes,

127

Sweet.

141
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,180
他这是讽刺我吗
Is that sarcasm?

142
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,210
非也  他是在控诉无能的美国教育系统
No, it's an indictment of the American education system.

143
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,630
阿奇漫画都在那边呢
The Archies are over here.

144
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,360
好滴
Yippee.

145
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,940
你们几位来不来我的新年化装派对啊
So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?

146
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,850
当然来啊
Of course.

147
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,090
我们要组成美国正义联盟
We're coming as the Justice League of America.
美国DC漫画公司创作的超级英雄团队

148
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,340
阵容安排得换一下
Switching it up from last year

149
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,480
不能和去年的重复了
when we came as the Justice League of America.

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,310
你这么一提
To that point,

151
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,360
让我忽然想起来  我们今年很有可能
it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity

152
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,970
最终赢得最佳团体服饰奖
to finally snare Best Group Costume

153
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,060
只要我们加强了当初的短板
if we shore up our weak link,

154
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,060
显然也就是莱纳德扮的超人
which is clearly Leonard as Superman.

155
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,020
喂  我今年新买了靴子好吧
Hey, I got new boots this year.

156
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,450
保证能增高三英寸
Guaranteed to add three inches.

157
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,120
真可悲
That's sad.

158
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,000
请扪心自问
Let's ask ourselves:

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,210
我们认识的人中有哪位
Is there anyone we know

160
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,990
能扮好更爷们更合适的氪星之子[即超人]呢
who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?

161
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,880
比穿高跟靴的莱纳德更爷们吗
Than Leonard in high-heeled boots?

162
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,450
跟穿高跟靴的霍华德老妈呢
Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?

163
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,650
我想到了那边那位
I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there

164
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,470
念念有词欣赏最新《贝蒂和维罗妮卡》的先生
moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.

165
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,350
扎克吗
Zack?

166
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,670
他是我们认识的  唯一有真正肌肉的人
He is the only person we know with actual muscles.

167
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,010
你们不能让扎克代替我
You can't replace me with Zack.

168
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,350
为啥不行  佩妮不就这么做了
Why not? Penny did it.

169
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,630
对啊  她好像比以前更开心了
Yeah, she seems happier.

170
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,550
为啥我们不行
Why wouldn't we be?

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
爽啊
Score.

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,020
我找到了《高中生阿奇》  《贝蒂和维罗妮卡》
I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica,

173
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,180
还有《笨瓜》这册
and a Jughead.

174
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,710
我的周末完美了
All set for my weekend number twos.

175
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,970
恭喜恭喜
Congratulations.

176
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,340
扎克  你觉得当超人感觉如何
Zack, how would you like to be Superman?

177
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,450
不知道诶  听起来责任重大啊
I don't kow. Sounds like a lot of responsibility.

178
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,990
好吧  如果扎克当超人的话
Fine. If Zack's gonna be Superman,

179
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,290
那我就要当绿灯侠
I want to be Green Lantern.

180
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,330
可我才是绿灯侠啊
But I'm Green Lantern.

181
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,790
你可以去当水行侠嘛
You can be Aquaman.

182
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,900
我才不想当水行侠呢
I don't want to be Aquaman.

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,990
太衰了
He sucks.

184
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,870
在水下都衰得不行
He sucks underwater.

185
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,830
还得喝鱼尿
He sucks fish pee.

186
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,620
容我插句嘴
Excuse me,

187
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,940
我觉得水行侠会用他的通灵术
I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers

188
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,470
让鱼儿们上别处撒尿去
to request the fish do their business elsewhere.

189
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,360
嗨  宝贝
Hey, babe.

190
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,680
我还在生你的气
I'm still mad at you.

191
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,840
等听到这个天大的喜讯  你就不会生气了
Well, you won't be when you hear the great news.

192
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,070
什么天大的喜讯
What great news?

193
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,490
我们在新年夜要去参加
We're going to a costume party

194
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,120
漫画店的化装派对
at the comic book store on New Year's Eve,

195
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,430
而你将扮成神奇女侠
and you get to be Wonder Woman.

196
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,360
还有防弹手镯和真理套索
Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth.

197
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,130
隐形飞机单独零售
Invisible plane sold separately.

198
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,240
慢着  为什么是我
Wait, why me?

199
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,370
为什么不找你女友做神奇女侠
Wh-Why can't your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?

200
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,100
她们实验室的人正在隔离中
She and her lab team are under quarantine.

201
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,850
貌似她们圣诞派对时用了
Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots

202
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,620
装黄热病毒的培养皿做果冻杯
out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.

203
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,770
好吧  那你朋友艾米呢
Okay, what about your friend Amy?

204
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,750
艾米·菲拉·福勒不会接受COSPLAY的
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes.

205
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,550
她没我这么思想开放
She isn't the free spirit I am.

206
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,660
好吧  别妄想了
Okay, well, forget it.

207
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
我可不想在新年夜
I'm not spending my New Year's Eve

208
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,170
扮成神奇女侠在漫画店度过
at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

209
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,560
他说要是你当水行侠  他愿意当神奇女侠
He says he'll wear it if you'll be Aquaman.

210
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,210
你在做啥子
What are you doing?

211
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,890
我们要迟到了
We're going to be late.

212
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,820
我在紧张地踱步
I'm pacing nervously.

213
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,190
你这是在慢跑
You're jogging.

214
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,340
闪电侠就这么踱步的
This is how the Flash paces.

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,140
淡定点  谢尔顿
Just chill out, Sheldon.

216
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,040
我不是谢尔顿  我是闪电侠
I'm not Sheldon. I'm the Flash.

217
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,000
现在我要去大峡谷吼叫
And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,110
发泄我心中的沮丧
to scream in frustration.

219
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,800
我回来了
I'm back.

220
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,090
蝙蝠侠来也
I'm Batman.

221
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,660
坑爹呢你
Oh, I hardly think so.

222
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,300
真正的蝙蝠侠要是迟到
The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts

223
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,250
会打电话通知战友的
when he's running late.

224
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,730
我是走路过来的
I had to walk.

225
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,550
拉杰上不了我的小摩托车后座
I couldn't get Raj on the back of my scooter.

226
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,570
我说过无数次了  但我还是要说
I've said this before, and I'll say it again.

227
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,060
水行侠太衰了
Aquaman sucks.

228
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,690
仰望天空  那是只鸟  是架飞机
Look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane.

229
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,310
后面的我忘了
I forget the rest.
后面那句应该是"那是超人"

230
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,140
好吧  我们早死早超生吧
All right. Let's get this thing over with.

231
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,420
不好意思
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,110
哪儿来的金发神奇女侠啊
But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?

233
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,990
龟毛个啥  谁会盯着她的头发看啊
Relax. No one's going to be looking at her hair.

234
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,750
痛啊
Ow!

235
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,340
应该是
I mean,

236
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,090
可恶
ow.

237
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,970
等等  那套服装里的黑色假发呢  宝贝儿
Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?

238
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,870
我才不要戴那个  看着逊毙了
No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.

239
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,570
拜托  我们可是要去比赛争冠军
Come on. We're trying to win a contest here.

240
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,210
想也别想  反正我不戴假发
Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.

241
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,840
佩妮  正义联盟里没有"小我"之说
Penny, there's no "I" In "Justice League."
事实上  Justice里有个"i" = =|||

242
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,920
其实...
Well, actually...

243
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,110
闭嘴  他在为我们说话呢
Don't. He's making our case.

244
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,730
好吧  宝贝儿
Okay, babe. Uh...

245
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,500
你让我在朋友面前有些难堪
Kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.

246
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,640
得了  告诉你
Okay. You know what?

247
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,370
我改主意了  我不去了
I changed my mind. I'm not going.

248
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,870
看来神奇女侠要换人咯
Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.

249
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,180
宝贝  开门
Babe, open up.

250
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,190
我不和你说话
I'm not talking to you.

251
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,470
那你现在在和谁说话
Then who are you talking to?

252
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,540
宝贝
Babe?

253
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:37,660
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

254
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,590
你到底有什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

255
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,970
我是闪电侠
I'm the Flash.

256
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,410
我刚敲了三万次门
I just knocked 30,000 times.

257
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,390
得  你要干嘛  谢尔顿
Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?

258
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,360
我明白你为什么不开心
I understand why you're upset.

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,350
是吗
Really?

260
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,480
是的
Yes.

261
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,810
你担心这个装扮会让你显胖
You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.

262
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,470
不是
No.

263
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,850
怎么...
Wh-What...

264
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,160
很显胖吗
Does it?

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,210
不用担心
Don't worry.

266
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,500
神奇女侠是亚马逊人
Wonder Woman was an Amazon.

267
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,340
亚马逊的女孩子都很高大健壮
And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.

268
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,500
滚吧  谢尔顿
Good-bye, Sheldon.

269
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,780
但她们不是金发  快把假发戴上
But they're not blonde, so put on your wig.

270
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,060
听到吗
Hello?

271
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,100
傻逼水行侠
Stupid Aquaman.

272
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,470
不知道这样算不算安慰
If it makes you feel any better,

273
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,440
我以前和佩妮交往时
when I was dating Penny,

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
她也一直会生我的气
she used to flip out on me all the time.

275
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,300
啥  你和佩妮约会过
Whoa. You dated Penny?

276
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,250
她都没和你说吗
She didn't tell you?

277
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,150
她说和个叫莱纳德的人交往过
She told me she dated a guy named Leonard.

278
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,360
谁会想到那就是你
Who would have thought it was you?

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,370
那还能是谁
Who else would it be?

280
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,420
我也不知道  某个更壮的...
I don't know. Somebody bigger and...

281
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,030
可不是  显然是你嘛
Yeah, sure. Why not you?

282
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,170
我也许失败了
I may have failed.

283
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,690
好吧  那我们只能不带神奇女侠去了
Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.

284
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,210
佩妮不去我也不去
I don't want to go without Penny.

285
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,010
太好了  没有超人  没有神奇女侠
Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman?

286
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,540
就只有瘦骨嶙峋的闪电侠
All we've got is a skinny Flash,

287
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,020
印度水行侠
an Indian Aquaman,

288
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,550
近视的绿灯侠
a nearsighted Green Lantern,

289
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,380
还有个袖珍型的蝙蝠侠
and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.

290
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,390
显然  这不能再称为正义联盟
Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League.

291
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,460
指《The Muppet Show》[《大青蛙布偶秀》]
没办法了  只能换布偶装了
We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.

292
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,480
我要当科米蛙
Ooh, I call Kermit.
科米蛙是该秀的导演和支持
斯库特是跑腿  剧场主人的侄子

293
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,780
我才是科米蛙  你当斯库特
I'm Kermit. U're Scooter.

294
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,340
不要  斯库特太衰了
Oh, man. Scooter sucks.

295
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,260
他就是《大青蛙布偶秀》里的水行侠
He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.

296
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,380
不  不到最后不能放弃
No, we can still make this work.

297
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,240
莱纳德  你去找佩妮谈
Leonard, you talk to Penny.

298
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,220
你为啥觉得我能说服她
What makes you think I can convince her?

299
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,790
你都让她跟你上床了
You got her to have sex with you.

300
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,290
很明显  你的超能力就是给人洗脑
Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.

301
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,800
好吧  看我这么说对不对
Okay, let me see if I understand this.

302
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,140
你想让我去说服我前女友
You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend

303
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,730
去跟她的新男友一起参加化装派对
to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend

304
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,730
就为了让我们赢那个愚蠢的奖吗
just so we can win a stupid prize?

305
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,700
对  记得让她戴上黑假发  好运
Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.

306
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,930
走开  谢尔顿
Go away, Sheldon.

307
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,140
我是莱纳德
It's Leonard.

308
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,100
走开  莱纳德
Go away, Leonard.

309
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,240
拜托  让我跟你谈谈
Come on, let me just talk to you.

310
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,350
门开着呢
It's open.

311
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,190
我不会去那派对的  莱纳德
I'm not going to that party, Leonard.

312
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,230
听我说  你不必戴那假发
Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig.

313
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,720
只要能带个女生去那派对
At this party, we're gonna win first prize

314
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,170
我们就等于不战而胜了
just by showing up with a girl.

315
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,320
不是假发的问题
It's not the wig.

316
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,910
那是因为我吗
Did I do something?

317
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,590
我想跟扎克交个朋友
I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack,

318
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,420
相信我  那对我并不容易
like you said, which believe me, was difficult,

319
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,360
鉴于你我之前...
given how you and me used to be...

320
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,830
之前是我们  现在你和他在一起了
you know, "You and me," And now you and him are "You and him."

321
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,480
其实  我们并没真正在一起
Okay, look. We're not really "Me and him."

322
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,790
那你俩这算什么
Then what are you?

323
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,730
我不知道
I don't know.

324
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,440
我之所以重新跟扎克约会
I only started seeing Zack again

325
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,230
只因为我不想独自度过新年夜
so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve.

326
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,240
多可悲啊
How pathetic is that?

327
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,260
没有穿成这个样子
Not as pathetic as dressing up like this

328
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,600
新年夜去漫画书店度过可悲
and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve.

329
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,780
你扮成绿箭侠很可爱
You make a cute Green Arrow.

330
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,630
这是绿灯侠
Green Lantern.

331
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,340
又没什么区别
Like there's a difference.

332
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,580
有很大区别
There's a big difference.

333
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,330
射箭是这样的
Arrow.

334
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,100
提灯是这样的
Lantern.

335
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,930
随便吧  要是我和扎克去一个
Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone

336
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,660
普通的夜店或派对  那就没问题
to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine,

337
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,740
但让我扮成这样  还有你...
but this, with the costumes, and you...

338
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,380
我怎么了
What about me?

339
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,880
没什么
Nothing.

340
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
我们去派对吧
Let's go to the party.

341
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,130
我看起来怎样
How do I look?

342
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,250
我保证你会是派对上最靓的女孩
I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there.

343
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,290
好了  好消息是  我们有神奇女侠了
Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.

344
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,300
太好了
Oh. Yes.

345
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,520
坏消息呢
What's the bad news?

346
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,820
超人今晚不会有"性福"了
Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight.

347
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,630
该死
Aw, damn.

348
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,980
获得最佳服装奖的组合是...
And the award for best group costume goes to...

349
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,940
美国正义联盟...
Justice League of America...

350
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,680
三号队
Number Three!

351
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,490
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you! Thank you so much!

352
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,410
好了  倒数十秒到新年
Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.

353
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,950
十  九  八
Ten, nine, eight...

354
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,020
不  等等
No, wait!

355
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,530
我还得发言呢
I have a speech.

356
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,490
-七   六...  -别数了
- Seven, six... - Stop counting!

357
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,840
-五  四  三...  -这一时刻应该属于我
- Five, four, three... - This is my moment, dag nab it!

358
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,280
二  一
Two, one!

359
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,910
新年快乐
Happy New Year!

360
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,120
除非你们安静下来
I'm not going to say another word

361
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,540
不然我是不会再说话了
until you people settle down.

362
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,320
我等着呢
I'm waiting.

363
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,440
这派对真棒
That was a great party.

364
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,620
我们真该一直这样穿
We should dress like this all the time.

365
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,240
你嗑药了吗
Are you high?

366
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,470
现在是你在欺负他了
You're being a bully.

367
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,020
快看
Check it out.

368
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,400
那些人在砸车窗偷东西
Those guys are breaking into that car.

369
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,890
我们该怎么办
What should we do?

370
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
我们是美国正义联盟
We're the Justice League of America.

371
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,690
唯一能做的事
There's only one thing we can do.

372
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,830
就是转身默默走开
Turn around and slowly walk away.

373
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,070
算了
Nah.

374
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,350
等等我
Hold up.

375
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,190
我知道冬天恒温器要设定在
Look, I know our winter thermostat setting

376
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,970
华氏72度[约22摄氏度]  但我有点热
is 72 degrees, but I'm a little warm,

377
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,900
所以我调低点啊
so I'm going to turn it down.

378
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,320
帕萨迪纳[加州]

379
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,620
大峡谷国家公园[亚利桑那州]

380
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,890
天哪  你太让我失望了  莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter!

381
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,240
好吧
Fine.
