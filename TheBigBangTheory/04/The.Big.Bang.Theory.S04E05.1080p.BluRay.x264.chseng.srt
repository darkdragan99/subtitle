1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,070
我只是想说  一部像样的《绿巨人》
All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,530
让电影公司砸了不少钱
trying to make a decent Hulk movie,

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,980
他们完全可以拿这笔钱  造一个真正的绿巨人出来
they could probably just make an actual Hulk.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,580
这观点真是聪明又有趣
That is apt and amusing.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,250
我应该跟艾米·菲拉·福勒分享
I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,850
她一定会欣赏你的妙语连珠
She'll appreciate the witticism.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,730
不敢当
Thank you.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,770
这同时也能改善你在她心目中的最初印象
It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,920
你们俩最近如何
So what's going on with you two?

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,750
状态一直维持不变
Well, the status is as it always was.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,430
她是位女生  她也是位朋友
She's a girl. She's a friend.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,440
但她不是我的
She is not my--

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,050
请原谅我做这个动作
please forgive me for doing this--

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,750
"女朋友"
"Girlfriend."

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,010
好吧  好吧
Right, right.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,400
所以你们一直保持在发短信和发邮件的阶段吗
So you're still just texting and emailing?

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,840
你难道一点也不想跟她呆在一起吗  比如
You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know--

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,520
呆在一个房间也好啊
be in the same room?

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,030
莱纳德  你是我最好的朋友
Leonard, you are my best friend.

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,920
我认识你整整七年了
I've known you for seven years,

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,300
而我却还难以忍受  咱俩同坐在一个沙发上这个事实
and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you.

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,480
你就可以想象得到
Imagine my attitude regarding

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,140
我对与艾米·菲拉·福勒长时间身体接触的态度了
prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,040
明白了
Got it.

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,120
我感觉你有意见
I sense judgment on your part.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,920
没有  哪有
No, no.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,820
或许有那么一点儿吧
Maybe a little.

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,670
我可以认为你的批评是基于嫉妒吗
May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.

29
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,390
嫉妒  有什么值得让我嫉妒的
Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,170
我与一位女性有一段运行良好且令人满意的关系
I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female.

31
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,820
而你没有
You have none.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,130
被你说中了
Oh, right. That.

33
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,510
嫉妒是一个丑陋的  眼发绿光的怪物
Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster--

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,890
跟绿巨人浩克一样
not unlike the Hulk--

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,670
随便说一下  人家也是有女朋友的
who, by the way, also has a girlfriend.

36
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,080
在这段重播里  妮弗·康纳利
In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly,

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,630
或许你记得的版本是《美丽心灵》里
whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,860
罗素·克洛的女朋友
in A Beautiful Mind,

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,790
说不定都和绿巨人共赴巫山了
a feel-good romp if there ever was one.

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,000
我才没有嫉妒
I'm not jealous.

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,250
莱纳德一点儿也不嫉妒
Leonard not jealous.

42

生活大爆炸第四季第五集

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
我刚想到一件事
You know, it just occurred to me,

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
如果存在千万个平行宇宙
if there are an infinite number of parallel universes,

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,070
在其中的一个  那里很可能有一位谢尔顿
in one of them, there's probably a Sheldon

50
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,080
他根本不相信有平行宇宙的存在
who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
很可能  你的重点是什么
Probably. What's your point?

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,750
没重点
No point.

53
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,920
这只是让千万个我中的某我
It's just one of the things

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,470
发笑的理由之一
that makes one of the mes chuckle.

55
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
莱纳德  什么事会让你发笑
What makes you chuckle, Leonard?

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,670
最近吗
Hmm, recently?

57
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,880
不是很多
Not much.

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,870
是因为那场争端吗  起因于
Is it because of the conflict that arises

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,210
你极其需要与一个女人建立对偶关系
from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman,

60
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,640
而显然所有的女性做出的决定
and the apparent collective decision of all womankind

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,860
都是否决了你
to deny you that opportunity?

62
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,740
呃
Um...

63
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,580
你还是把嘴闭上吧
Shut up.

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,010
当我爷爷过世之后
You know, when my grandfather died,

65
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,800
剩奶奶独自一人  我妈妈就安排
and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,720
让她一周去三次活动中心
to visit a center three times a week

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,960
在那里  她可以与同样孤独的人交流
where she could socialize with other lonely people.

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
这个安排非常好
It's very nice.

69
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,370
他们讨论时事  玩桥牌  吃热乎乎的饭
They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.

70
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,960
听起来不错
That sounds lovely.

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,890
如果你喜欢玩桥牌的话
It is if you like bridge.

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
你喜欢玩桥牌吗  莱纳德
Do you like bridge, Leonard?

73
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,260
谢尔顿  我只是现在没有人约会而已
Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now.

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,760
不用把我送到老年活动中心吧
I don't need to go to a senior center.

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,320
奶奶一开始也是拒绝  但后来她欲罢不能
Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,330
好  如果我最近还没碰到合适的人
Fine. If I don't meet someone soon,

77
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,120
你就把我送去养老院得了
you can put me in a home.

78
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,990
那不是养老院
It's not a home.

79
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,580
是老年人活动中心
It's a senior center.

80
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,230
我们绝不会把奶奶送到养老院
We'd never put Meemaw in a home!

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,470
嗨  大家好啊
Hey, guys.

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,850
-嗨  -嗨
- Hey.  - Hey.

83
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,830
我屈服于社交的压力  跟你们打声招呼吧
All right, I'll bow to social pressure: Hey!

84
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,460
抱歉  我女朋友伯纳黛特打来的
Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette.

85
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,070
我给她设了专门的铃声
I assigned her her own ringtone--

86
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,080
用的“四顶尖”唱的《伯纳黛特》
"Bernadette," By The Four Tops.

87
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,180
伯纳黛特  你好啊
Hello, Bernadette.

88
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,110
我给他打电话时  铃声是"褐眼女孩"
When I call him, his phone plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,390
现在回想起来  好像不是那么好了
Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.

90
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,750
你应该意识到  他是在炫耀他有女朋友而咱们没有
You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact

91
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,760
故意让咱们不爽
that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,550
你是说  你没有吧
You mean, you don't.

93
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,460
连你都有女朋友了
You have a girlfriend?

94
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,270
你怎么会有女朋友呢
How could you have a girlfriend?

95
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,530
你在女人面前连话都说不出来
You can't even speak to women.

96
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,500
送你两个字  聋女
Two words-- deaf chick.

97
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,210
所以我说不说话都没关系
It doesn't matter if I can't talk,

98
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,170
因为她根本听不见
because she can't hear me.

99
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,730
什么
What?

100
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,520
这是她的原话
That's what she said.

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
很好  你有女朋友  霍华德有女朋友
Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend,

102
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,860
-谢尔顿有女  -错错错错
- Sheldon's got a girl... - No, no, no, no!

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,990
女性朋友
...who's a friend.

104
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,420
多谢
Thank you.

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,530
你呢  斯图特
What about you, Stuart?

106
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,880
你有女朋友了吗
You have a girlfriend yet?

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,980
有了  有了
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,760
我们是在动漫大会上相遇的
I met her at Comic-Con,

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,100
那里是全世界唯一一个地方
the one place in the world where saying

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,430
可以用"我有一家漫画书屋"
"I own a comic bookstore"

111
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,580
作为真正的开场白
is an actual pickup line.

112
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,710
哇哦  恭喜你
Oh. Well, good for you.

113
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,740
其实她很可怕
Not really. She's horrible.

114
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,650
当她想做爱的时候
When she wants to have sex,

115
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,610
她会穿上她超大号的神奇女侠装  然后大喊
she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

116
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,580
"谁想坐一下我的隐形飞机"
"Who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?"

117
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,730
你为什么不直接跟她分手呢
Why don't you just break up with her?

118
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,370
不  我做不到
No, no, I can't.

119
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,940
为什么
Why not?

120
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,500
因为分手后  我形影单只  像你一样
'Cause then I'd be alone, like you.

121
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,650
兄弟  你为什么不让沃罗威茨
Dude, why don't you just invoke

122
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,410
履行女友条例呢
your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?

123
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,250
因为我用不着他女朋友
Because I don't need his girlfriend

124
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,110
介绍一个女朋友给我
to set me up with one of her girlfriends.

125
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,260
我完全有能力自己找一个女朋友
I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.

126
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,760
莱纳德  你让我想到
Oh, Leonard, you remind me

127
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,450
一个古老的搞笑故事
of the funny old story about a man

128
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,710
是讲一个男人拿着一叠
who walks into a women's correctional institution

129
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,100
女囚犯的释放许可
with a stack of paperwork

130
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,690
走进女子监狱
that will allow the female convicts to go free.

131
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,360
你是想说  我即使拿着赦令
You're saying I couldn't get laid

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,260
走进女子监狱  也没人会跟我上床
in a women's prison with a handful of pardons.

133
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,400
你到底还让不让我讲这个故事了
Are you going to let me tell the story or not?

134
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,170
莱纳德
Leonard?

135
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,720
你在睡觉吗
Are you sleeping?

136
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,530
没有
No.

137
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,710
你病了吗
Are you ill?

138
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,920
没有
No.

139
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,820
你还为你的寂寞和无人疼爱
Are you still depressed

140
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
而郁郁寡欢吗
because you're alone, and no one loves you?

141
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,450
不知道  也许吧
I don't know. Maybe.

142
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,710
我想让你知道  我由衷地关心
I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned

143
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,330
你的身体健康
about your well-being.

144
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,270
-谢谢  -不用客气
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

145
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,450
但是你还是没有理由把脚放在我的位子上
But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.

146
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,520
我可以说说我的看法吗
May I offer an observation?

147
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,420
搞什么  她在这多久了
What the hell? How long has she been here?

148
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,400
打我们从漫画店回来开始
Since we got home from the comic bookstore.

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,170
那是两小时前的事了
That was two hours ago.

150
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,570
根据你的建议
As per your suggestion,

151
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,710
我们正在相处
we're hanging out.

152
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,810
老实说  我都不知道
Quite frankly, I don't see

153
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,500
你有什么好大惊小怪的
what all the hoopla's about.

154
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,810
继续说  艾米
Go on, Amy.

155
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,940
从神经生物学的角度看  莱纳德
From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard,

156
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,680
你之所以独身
you may be alone

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,500
可能是由于你的心理状态
because your psychological state is causing

158
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,920
导致你的身体散发出绝望的味道
an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.

159
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,580
你知道这个理论吗  莱纳德
Did you know that, Leonard?

160
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,760
-不知道  -我就知道
- No.  - I did.

161
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,320
我知道有些人在公共聚集场所
I understand that some people find mates

162
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
像是酒吧或是小酒馆里寻找伴侣
in social gathering places such as bars or taverns.

163
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,950
你到酒吧或是酒馆试过吗
Have you tried a bar or tavern?

164
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,200
没有  我才不要去酒吧里泡妞呢
No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.

165
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,450
明智的决定  听我分析  艾米
Wise decision. You see, Amy,

166
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,110
想要在酒吧成功找到伴侣  是要靠
success at a bar is based on classic male attributes

167
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,240
典型的男性特质的  像是身高  力量
such as height, strength, attractiveness,

168
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,950
魅力  还有喝酒和投飞镖的能力
the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts --

169
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,320
或是边喝酒边投飞镖的能力
separately or together.

170
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,630
而莱纳德不具备其中的任何一点特质
Leonard has none of these attributes,

171
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,210
对吧  莱纳德
right, Leonard?

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,350
没错
Right.

173
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,770
并不是在所有吧都要这样的
That's not true of all bars.

174
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,190
比如说果汁吧
Juice bars, for example.

175
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,300
说得好  艾米
Oh! Good point, Amy.

176
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,050
在这个前提下
Yeah, building on your premise,

177
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,470
莱纳德可以经常光顾寿司吧
Leonard could frequent sushi bars,

178
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,390
沙拉吧  生蚝吧
salad bars, oyster bars,

179
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,630
还有苹果天才吧  你在干吗
the Apple Genius Bar...what are you doing?

180
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,420
继续说吧  我听着呢
Keep going. I'm listening.

181
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,030
真没礼貌
That was rude.

182
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,510
他总是这样
He does it all the time.

183
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,560
他就是社交无能的集合体
He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.

184
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,730
集合体
Cornucopia.

185
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,010
多么甜美流畅的词呀
What a mellifluous word.

186
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,910
就把这个词定为今日美词吧
Let's make that our word of the day.

187
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,910
同意  明天开始用"甜美流畅"
Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.

188
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,160
我要去排空一下我的膀胱
Well, I have to void my bladder.

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,310
跟你一起相处很愉快
It was nice spending this time with you.

190
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,380
等一下
Wait.

191
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,930
我有个请求
I have a request.

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,790
什么请求
Yes?

193
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,590
我想让你见见我的母亲
I'd like you to meet my mother.

194
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,680
知道了
I see.

195
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,290
我回头答复你好吗
Can I get back to you on that?

196
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,900
当然可以  晚安
Certainly. Good night.

197
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,640
晚安
Good night.

198
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,380
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

199
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,890
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

200
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,550
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard, leonard,

201
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,200
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

202
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,790
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

203
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,800
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard,

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,860
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard...

205
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,370
干吗
Yeah, what?

206
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,750
艾米·菲拉·福勒让我见她母亲
Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.

207
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,290
那又怎样
Yeah. So?

208
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,060
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

209
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,760
你不是总是说
Well, you know how you're always saying

210
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
艾米只是你的女性朋友吗
that Amy is a girl who's your friend,

211
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
而不是你的女朋友
and not your girlfriend?

212
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,270
-嗯  -你以后就不能再这么说咯
- Uh-huh.  - You can't say that anymore.

213
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,580
等一下  你说什么
Wait. What?

214
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,600
她很显然
Look, she obviously wants

215
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,980
想要你们的关系更进一步
to take your relationship to the next level.

216
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,490
我不想更进一步
I don't want the next level.

217
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,400
我喜欢现在这步
I like this level.

218
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
帮我搞掂她
Fix it for me!

219
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,490
我
Me?

220
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,150
我怎么帮你搞掂啊
Well, how am I supposed to fix it?

221
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,070
很简单  你想要女朋友
Simple! You want a girlfriend,

222
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,610
艾米想要当别人的女朋友
Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend.

223
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,280
我把她给你  我会祝福你们的
Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.

224
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,650
你都疯的
That is insane.

225
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,760
没错  不会成功的
You're right. It would never work.

226
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,580
艾米觉得你很乏味
Amy finds you tedious.

227
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,370
好吧  祝你好运
Okay, good luck.

228
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,750
等一下  我该怎么办啊
Wait! What am I supposed to do?

229
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,890
你有没有想过跟她分享你的感受
Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?

230
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,380
莱纳德  我是物理学家  不是嬉皮士
Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.

231
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,980
好吧  让我想想
All right, well, let me see

232
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,940
看我能不能用物理现象解释给你听
if I can explain your situation using physics.

233
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,040
如果说你被绑在
What would you be

234
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,060
一个围绕轴心成螺旋状的
if you were attached to another object

235
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,610
倾斜平面上的话  你的下场会是什么
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?

236
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,510
拧一块儿了[也有完蛋的意思]
Screwed.

237
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,750
懂了吧
There you go.

238
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,000
艾米说的没错
Amy's right.

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,930
他真没劲儿
He is tedious.

240
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,890
霍华德  去开门
Howard, get the door!

241
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,180
你干嘛不去
Why can't you get it?

242
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,100
你知道我在为准备结肠镜检查浣肠
You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy!

243
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,680
我这里就像个大头朝下的火山
I'm like an upside-down volcano here.

244
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,150
是你呀  好啊
Oh, hey.

245
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,870
但愿你没听到
I hope you didn't hear that.

246
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,900
火山什么的吗  没听到
The volcano thing? No.

247
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,110
怎么穿了这么一件T恤
What's with the T-shirt?

248
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,600
现在在苹果专卖店打工了吗
You working at the Apple store now?

249
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
不是啦  就是随便穿的
No, it's just something I threw on.

250
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,550
你的衣服我都认得
I know all your shirts.

251
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,240
你没这件
That's not one of them...

252
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,800
你假装在天才咨询吧工作
You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
借机泡妞是不是
to pick up women, weren't you?

254
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
是
Yeah.

255
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,480
我发现原来他们只管看着iPod
Turns out, they guard the iPods,

256
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,400
没人管这些T恤
but they don't guard the shirts.

257
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,530
那成果如何
So, how'd it go?

258
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,940
本来挺顺利的
It was going well.

259
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,300
我给个辣妹展示
I was showing this super hot girl

260
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,620
怎样从安全模式启动
how to boot up in Safe Mode.

261
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,760
经理起了疑心  长话短说吧
The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short,

262
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,580
那商场里真的有个小号房
they really do have a little jail in the mall.

263
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,630
听哥句劝  千万别贴上假胡子接着回去装
Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake mustache.

264
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,220
他们虽然不天才
I mean, they may not really be geniuses,

265
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,410
却能立马看出你是装的
but they see right through that.

266
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,000
我申请调用女友约定  霍华德
I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.

267
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,160
你这么饥渴
You that desperate?

268
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,510
也不是  我就是想像你一样
No, I just... I want what you have.

269
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,440
你懂的  身边有个女人
You know, I want a woman in my life.

270
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,110
天呐
Holy Moses,

271
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,140
菊花到底能灌进多少液体啊
how much liquid can be in one tokus?

272
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,700
明确一下  我说的是伯纳黛特不是你妈
To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.

273
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
我明白你的意思
Yeah, I know what you mean.

274
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,370
我要去见伯纳黛特的朋友了
Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend.

275
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,640
我看起来咋样
How do I look?

276
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
就好像《人体异形》里
As if one of the plants

277
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,510
某植物复制出来的你
from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way,

278
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,060
不过是海量发胶版的
only with an absurd amount of hair gel.

279
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,530
你在干嘛呢
What are you working on?

280
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,490
我在清除我的网络足迹
I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet

281
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,620
这样艾米·菲拉·福勒就找不到我了
so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me

282
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,220
也就没法逼我见她妈了
and compel me to meet her mother. Ah.

283
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,640
你是在玩儿失踪啊
You're going off the grid.

284
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,810
正解
Exactly.

285
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,390
早年炸弹客的做法啊  不错嘛
The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
16岁进哈佛  25岁成伯克利教授  后隐居邮寄炸弹

286
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
多谢
Thank you.

287
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,730
我还发给了艾米一封关系终止通知
I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice

288
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,230
并更换了手机号和邮箱地址
and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.

289
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,210
她直接过来怎么办
What if she just comes over?

290
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,350
她找不到的
She'll get lost.

291
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,070
我们已经不住Los Robles 2311号了
We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles.

292
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,640
我们的现住址是Los Robles 311号
We now live at 311 Los Robles.

293
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,960
你把门牌号给改了
You changed the address on the building?

294
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,910
信件怎么办
What about mail?

295
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,910
放心吧  我跟咱的邮差解释了
Oh, no worries-- I explained my predicament

296
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,010
我当前的囧境
to our letter carrier.

297
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,040
他很是同情
He was sympathetic.

298
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
他的原话是
His exact words were:

299
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,650
"哥们挺你  兄弟
"Got your back, Jack.

300
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,800
妞儿们都疯了"
Bitches be crazy."

301
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,600
谁啊
Who is it?

302
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,510
艾米·菲拉·福勒
Amy Farrah Fowler.

303
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,470
我去  被她逮到了
Darn! She found me!

304
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,670
她来过这里好不好
She's been here before.

305
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
智者千虑必有一失
The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan.

306
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,710
现在你得挺我  兄弟
Now, get my back, Jack.

307
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,590
-你想让我怎么办  -跟她说我不在
- What do you want to do? - Tell her I'm not here.

308
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,200
-那你在哪儿  -不知道
- Okay, where are you? - I don't know.

309
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,710
你得自己设计个情节
You'll have to devise a scenario

310
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,460
合理地解释我的不在场
that plausibly explains my absence,

311
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,070
要记得  说谎的秘诀在于善于编织细节
keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.

312
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,910
你好啊  艾米
Hi, Amy.

313
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,270
谢尔顿不在
Sheldon's not here.

314
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,910
好吧
All right.

315
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,590
细节编织得可真到位呀
Way to go on the details.

316
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,480
再次感谢你帮我  伯纳黛特
Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.

317
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,890
我向来恪守约定
Oh, I take pacts very seriously.

318
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,020
有一次在实验室
One time at my lab,

319
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,510
一个转基因超级病毒培养皿不见了
a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing.

320
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,630
那天我们都拉钩发誓绝不承认
That day we made a pinky swear never to admit

321
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,280
我们曾让埃博拉病毒和伤寒病毒结合
we crossed Ebola with the common cold.

322
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,960
你们为什么要
Why the hell

323
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,240
让埃博拉病毒和伤寒病毒结合
would you cross Ebola with the common cold?

324
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,620
我们没有啊
We never did.

325
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,750
那样就太可怕了
That would be a terrible, terrible thing.

326
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,570
大家好  抱歉迟到了  我从健身房来
Hi. Sorry I'm late-- I was at the gym.

327
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,820
动感训练课  真出了不少汗呢
Spin class-- worked up quite a sweat.

328
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,370
乔伊  这是莱纳德  莱纳德  这是乔伊
Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.

329
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,700
-好啊  -好
- Hi. - Hi.

330
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,040
你真没有天才相
You don't look like a genius.

331
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,190
来  说点有才的给姐听听
Go ahead, say something smart.

332
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,300
啊哈  时间到
Uh... Aah! Time's up.

333
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,570
开玩笑啦
Just kidding.

334
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,310
你需要了解我的第一件事就是
First thing you need to know about me:

335
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,540
我超搞笑的
I'm hilarious.

336
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,420
看出来了
Yeah.

337
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,100
伯纳黛特告诉我
So, Bernadette tells me

338
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,460
你们是在自卫课上认识的
she knows you from self-defense classes?

339
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,680
没错  以色列格斗术
Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.

340
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,860
可好玩了
Lots of fun.

341
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,400
基本上是学了一百种不同的
Basically, a hundred different ways

342
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,950
扯下男人蛋蛋的方式
to rip a guy's nuts off.

343
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,370
天呐  没想到这么多啊
Wow. Wouldn't think there'd be that many.

344
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,040
四十二招
Number 42!

345
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,230
天呐
Whoa!

346
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,980
多可爱的姑娘啊
Isn't she a pip?

347
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,150
比邻星是最近的星星
Proxima Centauri's the nearest star.

348
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,390
接下来的天体顺次是

南河三A

361
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,970
见鬼  错了
Oh, darn, that's wrong!

362
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,590
宝瓶座鲁坦星A
EZ Aquarii A,

363
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,650
宝瓶座鲁坦星B
EZ Aquarii B,

364
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,220
宝瓶座鲁坦星C
EZ Aquarii C,

365
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,870
南河三A
Procyon A.

366
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,050
这些是离我最近的恒星
Those are the stars that are nearest to me.

367
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,250
一闪一闪那么地亮晶晶
Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

368
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
天呐
Oh, dear.

369
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,420
妞儿们真是疯了
They really do be crazy.

370
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,080
这龙虾口感十足
This lobster's good on the way down

371
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,790
也回味无穷啊
and the way up.

372
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,120
应该的  一磅要30大洋呢
Should be-- it's $30 a pound.

373
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,810
这算是约会吧
Hey, this is a date, right?

374
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,390
没错
Yep, it is.

375
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,210
第73招
73!

376
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,970
不好意思  我要去一下洗手间
Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room...

377
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,940
好好地通体舒畅一下
and take a wicked whiz.

378
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,610
我也一起去
I'll go with you.

379
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,930
友情提醒  我刚吃了芦笋
Fair warning-- I had the asparagus.

380
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,620
我排泄出来的芦笋宝宝们会让这地方臭气熏天
My pea is gonna stink up the place.

381
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,530
我觉得她喜欢你耶
I think she likes you.

382
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,580
宝瓶座鲁坦星B
EZ Aquarii B...

383
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,070
宝瓶座鲁坦星C
EZ Aquarii C...

384
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,560
借过一下  女士
Excuse me, madam.

385
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,470
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

386
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,750
靠
Rats!

387
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,440
我请你去见我母亲这事
I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred

388
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,420
我想你可能有点误会
when I asked you to meet my mother.

389
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,280
我没误会
No misunderstanding.

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,200
我了解到那个要求意味着什么
I've learned what that request actually means,

391
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,510
我不想变成一个斜面绕轴
and I don't want to be joined to another object

392
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,440
螺旋状转上几圈之后的样子
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.

393
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,360
谁说你完蛋了
In what way are you screwed?

394
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,850
我只是想把你当作男友介绍给我妈
All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother

395
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,770
让她相信我在恋爱  好让她放心
so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.

396
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
这么说我们是要做戏咯
So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?

397
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,930
一点没错
Precisely.

398
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,250
你没有无可救药地爱上我吗
And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?

399
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,090
别傻了
Don't be absurd.

400
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,820
在我看来  爱情关系
I find the notion of romantic love

401
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,620
是种毫无必要的文化构造
to be an unnecessary cultural construct

402
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,240
对人类关系毫无价值可言
that adds no value to human relationships.

403
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,450
艾米·菲拉·福勒  这是我听过的
Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing

404
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,720
最务实的话了
anyone has ever said to me.

405
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,440
既然误会已经澄清了
I trust this clarification allows us to return

406
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,760
我们该回到男性朋友和女性朋友关系了吧
to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.

407
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,190
当然
Of course.

408
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,630
想和我一起去吃中餐么
Would you like to join me for Chinese food?

409
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,950
拜托  谢尔顿  别逼我
Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.

410
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,590
不好意思
My apologies.

411
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,150
-晚安  艾米  -晚安  谢尔顿
- Good night, Amy. - Good night, Sheldon.

412
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
别这样  给她个机会
Come on, just give her a chance.

413
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,050
也许你会慢慢喜欢上她
Maybe she'll grow on you.

414
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,150
也可能她最终成功扯下了我的蛋蛋
or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off.

415
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,430
毕竟还有93种办法她没尝试过呢
There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet.

416
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,020
听着  霍华德  谢谢你的好意
Look, H-Howard, I appreciate the effort,

417
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,610
但这是我经历过的最烂一次约会了
but this is, like, the worst date of my life.

418
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,990
真的假的
Seriously?

419
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,530
我被个在犹太交友网上的准变性人给抢了
I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date,

420
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,350
这种约会甚至都排不进我的最烂前十
and that didn't even crack my top ten.

421
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,370
我觉得区别在于  我懂得自重
I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.

422
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,490
我怎么不记得你有
Not that I've ever seen.

423
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,800
最近才有的
It's relatively new.

424
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,080
我只是认识到
I just know that

425
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,400
我不想就为了能有个女友
I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like

426
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,380
而和不喜欢的女生在一起
simply to have a girlfriend.

427
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
我一个人也挺好
I'm okay on my own.

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,560
好消息  我的胃腾够空间来吃甜食了
Good news-- I made lots of room for dessert.

429
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,130
听着  乔伊  很高兴认识你  但...
Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but...

430
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,810
我也是  你下周末有空么
Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

431
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,070
我表兄结婚  我要带个伴去
I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

432
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,320
你在约我出去吗
You're asking me out?

433
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,940
是啊
Yeah.

434
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,100
酒啊什么的免费畅饮哦
And it's an open bar,

435
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,810
说不定可以酒后那什么一下
so I'll probably be giving it away.

436
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
我很期待
I look forward to it.

437
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,480
我也很高兴认识你  谢尔顿
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

438
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,760
艾米告诉我她有个男友时
I honestly didn't believe Amy

439
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,370
我真的难以置信
when she told me she had a boyfriend.

440
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,830
我向你保证  我是有血有肉的真人
I assure you I'm quite real.

441
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,420
我和你女儿有着常规性交行为
and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter.

442
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,190
啥
What?

443
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,460
是的
Oh, yes.

444
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,350
我们就如同发情期的野生动物
We're like wild animals in heat.

445
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,630
我们居然还完好无损  真是奇迹
It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.

446
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,960
艾米  他在说什么
Amy... what is he saying?

447
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,630
你希望我交个男友  妈妈
You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother.

448
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,710
这就是我的男友
Well, here he is.

449
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,170
现在我得下线了
Have to sign off now.

450
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,450
我对谢尔顿的欲望已让我的花径颤抖
My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.

451
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,140
是的  我是时候该去
Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love

452
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,930
你女儿的阴道里做爱一番了
to your daughter's vagina.

453
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,080
多谢  谢尔顿  效果不错
Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.

454
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,940
同感
Agreed.

455
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,860
艾米  我禁不住这样想
Amy, I find myself wondering

456
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,190
我们在交往过程中
if we should actually engage in coitus

457
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,030
至少该真的性交一次试试
at least one time in our relationship.

458
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,510
逗你玩
Bazinga.

459
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,930
该睡觉了  你也该走了
Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
