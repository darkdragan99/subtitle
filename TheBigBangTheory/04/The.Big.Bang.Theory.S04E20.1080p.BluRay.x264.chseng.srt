1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,250
我的新书《隐藏的真相》讨论了一个很大的问题
My new book The Hidden Reality takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,510
我们的宇宙是唯一的吗
Is our universe the only universe?

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,740
越来越多像我这样的科学家相信
You see, there's a growing belief among scientists like me

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,240
我们也许只是茫茫空间里众多宇宙中的
that ours may only be one among many universes

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,870
其中一个
populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,100
在《隐藏的真相》中  我在不涉及
In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,460
任何数学和物理知识的情况下
without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,870
向读者阐释了这一可能
on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,140
可笑至极
Hysterical.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,190
很高兴你说服我来这里
I'm glad you talked me into this.

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,530
咱们平时太辛苦了  有时候偷个闲
We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,240
-干点儿蠢事儿也挺好的  -没错
- and do something silly. - Agreed.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,710
你等着听他跟大家胡扯沃纳·海森堡吧
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,460
你都会觉得自己是在德云社听相声
You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,910
你可以觉得海森堡的"不确定性原理"
You can think about Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle"

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,070
就像是在某些中国餐馆里的
much like the special order menu

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,490
每日特供菜单  你会发现有些菜
that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,240
在A栏里  有些菜在B栏里
dishes in column A and other dishes in column B,

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,800
如果你点了A栏里的第一道菜
and if you order the first dish in column A,

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,810
你就不能点B栏里的第一道菜了
you can't order the corresponding dish in column B.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,020
这就有点像"不确定性原理"
That's sort of like the "uncertainly principle."

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,070
当里个当
Ba-dum-bump.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,140
说起来  我听说了霍华德和
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,830
伯纳黛特的一件趣事儿
about Howard and Bernadette.

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,980
你开玩笑吧  艾米  跟我聊八卦
Really, Amy? Gossip?

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,290
我对你失望了
I'm disappointed in you.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,540
别急啊
No, now.

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,700
进化生物学家罗宾·邓巴把八卦定义为
Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,490
一种有助于在大群体内维系感情的手段
as an aid to social bonding in large groups.

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,680
恕我直言  全是扯淡
Forgive my language, but "poppycock".

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,070
万一不是呢
What if he's right?

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,980
如果没有八卦
And by not participating in gossip,

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,280
社会就会分裂成为
society breaks down into

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,680
一个个纹身摩托车手组成的野蛮小帮派
small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,610
为了最后几罐金枪鱼罐头打得死去活来
fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish.

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,320
好吧
Fine.

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,730
用城市音乐[黑人音乐]的术语来说
In the parlance of the urban music scene,

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,720
"你想跟我说啥"
"what's the 4-1-1"?
411为美国查号台  这里代指信息的意思

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,360
伯纳黛特想和霍华德分手
Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,400
我觉得咱国家的金枪鱼罐头还是安全的
I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,650
抱歉等下聊  格林博士  我能提问吗
Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?

42
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,590
请讲
Yes?

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,400
您一直致力于
You've dedicated your life's work

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
向公众宣传灌输一些
to educating the general populace

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,930
复杂的科学理念
about complex scientific ideas.

46
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,190
对  差不多
Yes, in part.

47
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,330
您有没有考虑过
Have you ever considered

48
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,740
干点儿更有意义的事儿呢
trying to do something useful?

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,810
比如  给老人念书
Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,170
你说什么
Excuse me?

51
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,250
嗯  不过别念你的书  念点儿他们喜欢的
Yeah, but not your books; something they might enjoy.

52
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,040
当然咯  我开玩笑啦  支持你哦
I kid, of course. Big fan.

生活大爆炸第四季第二十集

58
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,140
-射得好  -多谢
- Nice shot. - Thank you.

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,160
我父亲从小就在训练我射箭了
My father taught me archery as a child.

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,700
真没想到这项运动居然能唤起
It's odd how the activity

61
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,000
印象中凯马特波旁酒的醇香[他父亲酗酒]
brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.

62
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,940
-漂亮  -我知道
- Perfect. - I know.

63
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,300
我肯定能当个出色的精灵
What an elf I would have made.

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,740
你觉得你在干嘛呢
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,930
冲着靶子射箭啊
Shooting at a target?

66
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,270
拿什么射
With what?

67
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,860
-箭啊  -你开玩笑吧
- An arrow. - Really?

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,180
我都没看见你从箭筒里取箭
I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,750
我不会这么傻的  谢尔顿
I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,090
莱纳德  任天堂的人在重现真实的
Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far

71
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,930
竞技体验这方面只能做到这份儿上了
in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience.

72
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,720
剩下的得靠我们自己
We have to do our part, too.

73
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,290
虽然比较出乎意料  但是
That was uncalled for, but...

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,870
我还是配合一下吧  痛
I'll play along. Ow.

75
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,700
我昨晚和艾米有一次非凡的体验
I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,430
真的吗  你怎么感觉出来的
Really? How could you tell?

77
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,670
她想和我聊八卦
She was attempting to engage me in gossip.

78
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,260
-你肯定不干  -对
- Mm. You don't say. - Yes.

79
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,930
我觉得跟佩妮混时间长了
I think prolonged exposure to Penny

80
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,570
她也变得有点儿女孩子气了
has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,750
什么八卦啊
So, what's the gossip?

82
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,920
拜托  我都说了
Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,310
我对这种东西完全没兴趣
I have no desire to engage in the activity.

84
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,840
好吧  那就别跟我说了
Fine, don't tell me.

85
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,850
好吧  听着
All right, get this.

86
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,920
伯纳黛特想和霍华德分手
Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,050
真糟糕  出什么事儿了啊
That's too bad. I wonder what happened.

88
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,150
不好说  我只能推测一下
Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate

89
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,600
根据我观察我父母的婚姻分崩离析
based on the data I collected

90
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,120
所得到的数据
watching my parents' marriage implode.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,830
在我们家  我妈一头扎进了宗教的海洋
In that case, the woman dives into religion,

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,950
而我爸则一头扎进了金发女酒保的怀抱
while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender

93
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,660
那女人还想用超级英雄的玩具收买我呢
who tries to buy my love with action figures.

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,900
啊哦  没箭了
Oop! Out of arrows.

95
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,940
天啊  你这游戏买的真是太值了
Boy, you sure get your money's worth out of these games.

96
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,620
-普丽娅  我能进来吗  -进吧
- Priya, can I come in? - Sure.

97
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,880
天啊
Oh, God.

98
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,970
-怎么了  -没事
- What? - It's okay.

99
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,640
你不知道罢了  我来处理吧
You didn't know. I'll take care of it.

100
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,640
我  我做错什么了
What-what did I do?

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,180
谢尔顿禁止在离镜子
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

102
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,870
这么近的地方用牙线
that close to the mirror.

103
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,240
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,880
会溅上去的
It's a splatter thing.

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,190
地板上贴了一小段胶带
There's a little piece of tape on the floor

106
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,810
你得站在胶带后面
you're supposed to stand behind.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,590
-太雷人了  -我知道
- That's madness. - I know.

108
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,570
照做吧  待会儿会有大检查
Just do it. There's a big inspection coming up,

109
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,000
我可不想失去看电视的特权
and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.

110
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,630
你迟早得让我看一眼
You really need to let me take a look

111
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,690
那个室友协议
at that roommate agreement, one of these days.

112
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,180
有这必要吗
Mm, I don't know.

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,050
我俩各自请律师对簿公堂吗
I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer...

114
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,160
还是老老实实站黄线后算了
It's just easier to stand behind the tape.

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,750
对了  我一个同事说
Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said

116
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,510
要给我周末道奇队比赛的门票
I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend.

117
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,750
-应该很好玩吧  -那是
- Does that sound like fun?  - Yeah!

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,060
道奇是棒球队  对吧
Dodgers are baseball, right?

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,460
你到时候得给我解释一下比赛规则
You'll need to explain the game to me.

120
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,270
规则很复杂的
Mm, it's complicated.

121
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,170
不过在我看来  棒球的精髓就是
But as I remember it, the essentials are

122
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,060
最后才被选中  被球打  痛哭  回家
"get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home" .

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,360
不管怎么说都好  我有四张票呢
Well, regardless, I've got four tickets.

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,690
叫上伯纳黛特和霍华德一起去好吗
And I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard.

125
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,770
伯纳黛特真的很有意思
She's really interesting,

126
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,520
我想我早晚也能适应霍华德的存在
and I bet I can get used to him.

127
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,760
叫他俩去可能
Well, it might not be a great idea

128
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,790
-不太好  -为什么
- to invite those two.  - Why not?

129
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,100
别跟别人说是我说的
Don't tell anybody I told you,

130
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
不过据说伯纳黛特可能要跟霍华德分手
but I heard she might be breaking up with him.

131
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,210
太可惜了
Oh...too bad...

132
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,760
不过我倒认识一个会因此高兴的人
Although I do know one person for whom that's good news.

133
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,620
真的吗  谁呀
Really? Who?

134
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,570
我哥
My brother.

135
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,400
他超喜欢伯纳黛特
He's got a big crush on Bernadette.

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,070
什么
What?

137
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,850
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

138
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,580
没有  我看到过他给她写的诗
No. I found poems he wrote about her.

139
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,430
超诡异的
Very disturbing.

140
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,210
"噢  伯纳黛特  吹响我的单簧管吧"
"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet" .

141
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,410
-这太难以置信了  -就是说呀
- Wow, that's hard to believe.  - Yes.

142
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,270
这么多年来  我家所有人
And for years, everyone in my family

143
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,470
都坚信他有同性恋倾向呢
was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast.

144
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,270
这条黄线又是干嘛的
What's that piece of tape?

145
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,590
你用不着担心这个  反正你坐着上厕所
Oh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.

146
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,630
近来好吗
How's it going?

147
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,060
还不错  你听说伯纳黛特和霍华德的事了吗
Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?

148
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,080
当然了  你是怎么知道的
'Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?

149
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,790
我是听谢尔顿说的
I heard about it from Sheldon.

150
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,590
-他是听艾米说的  -该死
- He got it from Amy.  - Oh, damn it.

151
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,790
我还叫艾米绝对不能告诉别人呢
I told Amy that in the strictest confidence.

152
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,400
有些人还真是大嘴巴
Boy, some people are such blabbermouths.

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,090
随便啦
Well, whatever.

154
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,180
我相信伯纳黛特肯定能找到更好的
I'm sure Bernadette can do better.

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,290
你觉得一个有选择性缄默症  酗酒问题
Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist

156
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,570
而且性取向不稳定的印度天体物理学家
with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than

157
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,310
比体重一百磅  跟老妈住的犹太人强吗
a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?

158
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,210
你开玩笑吧  拉杰喜欢伯纳黛特吗
You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?

159
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,950
我可没说是拉杰  谁说是拉杰了
I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?

160
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,110
好了  快说
Okay, give.

161
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,240
你怎么知道的  他自己说的吗
How do you know? Did he tell you?

162
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,450
-不是  -那是谁说的
- No.  - Well, then who?

163
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,440
我不能说
I can't say...

164
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,660
普丽娅告诉你的  真是个小八婆
Priya told you. What a little gossip.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,320
一个女人这么八婆可不好  莱纳德
You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard.

166
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,670
我不是说她坏话  只是个人看法而已
Not judging, just my opinion.

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,010
问题是  要是这件事传开了
Well, The point is, if this got out,

168
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,390
可能会影响霍华德和拉杰的友谊
it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.

169
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,460
你用不着担心
You don't have to worry.

170
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,540
我又不像艾米和普丽娅  我嘴可严呢
Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.

171
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,840
这件事一开始就是你告诉艾米的
You're the one who told Amy in the first place.

172
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,090
我有叫她保密呀
In confidence.

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,010
你好  妈妈  你好  爸爸  你们好吗
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?

174
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,270
我们是穷国里的富人
We're very rich in a very poor country.

175
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,650
所以  总的来说  没啥好抱怨的
So, all in all, can't complain.

176
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,300
普丽娅
So, Priya,

177
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,540
你在你哥家住的还好吗
how are enjoying staying with your brother?

178
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,700
还不错  但是如果我要继续
It's fine. But if I'm going to stay

179
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,870
留在洛杉矶的话
in Los Angeles much longer,

180
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,790
我想我应该找个地方自己搬出去住
I think I should get my own place.

181
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,660
为什么
Why?

182
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,910
拉杰没给你提供舒适的环境吗
Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable?

183
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,740
拉杰  你为什么不给你妹妹提供舒适的环境
Rajesh, why aren't you making your sister comfortable?

184
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,120
我有啊
I am making her comfortable.

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,130
再说  反正她一半时间
Besides, she's not sleeping here

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,080
都不在我这睡
half the time anyw...

187
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,340
什么
What?

188
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,790
那你去哪睡  普丽娅
Where are you sleeping, Priya?

189
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,910
这只是修辞说法而已  爸
It's a figure of speech, Daddy.

190
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,150
意思是说我工作到很晚
It means I-I work late.

191
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,300
别说你交了个美国男朋友
Please tell me you're not dating an American.

192
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,770
我就知道会这样
I knew this would happen.

193
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,320
拉杰  你是不是让你妹
Rajesh, are you letting your sister

194
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,280
跟那个叫霍华德的小子交往了
date that little Howard boy?

195
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,880
等会  如果她真交了个美国男朋友的话
Now, hold on. If she is dating an American,

196
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,580
找霍华德也不错呀
that's not a bad way to go.

197
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,640
他是犹太人
He's Jewish.

198
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,280
犹太人都很成功的
Those chaps are very successful,

199
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
而且他们不怎么喝酒
and they don't drink a lot.

200
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,730
这都不重要啦  霍华德有女朋友的
It-It doesn't matter. Howard has a girlfriend.

201
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,430
-那只是目前而已  -这是什么意思
- For now.  - What does that mean?

202
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,540
晚点再告诉你
I'll tell you later.

203
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,490
他跟伯纳黛特之间出问题了吗
Is something going on with him and Bernadette?

204
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,290
-伯纳黛特是谁  -听起来不像是犹太人
- Who's Bernadette?  - Doesn't sound Jewish.

205
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,720
听名字哪听得出来
You can't tell by that.

206
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,780
威诺纳·赖德[美国女演员]也是犹太人啊
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

207
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,540
好吧  这个话题先放一放
Okay, we're getting off the subject.

208
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,970
拉杰  你要更努力地
Rajesh, I want you to try harder

209
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,710
让你妹妹觉得宾至如归
to make your sister feel welcome.

210
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,060
谢谢爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

211
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,730
别担心  只要是我的东西  我都会跟她分享的
Don't worry. Everything I have, I share with her.

212
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,970
包括我朋友莱...
Including my friend Leon...

213
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,190
晚安妈妈  晚安爸爸
Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.

214
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,250
天啊  我脚趾都被你踩断了
Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,950
谁叫你多嘴的
You should have kept your mouth shut.

216
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,720
好吧  是我的错
Fair enough.

217
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,250
给我说说单簧管  不对  是伯纳黛特的事吧
Now, what's up with Clarinet...? Bernadette!

218
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,510
我一直在想格林博士
I've been thinking about Dr. Greene's efforts

219
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,370
致力于把科学变得平民化的事
to make science palatable for the masses.

220
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,670
是吗  想出什么来了
Oh, yeah? What about it?

221
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,790
没什么  我就想了下
That's all. I've just been thinking about it.

222
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,550
现在  我在想分形方程
Now, I'm thinking about fractal equations.

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,010
现在我又在想
Now I'm thinking about

224
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,210
"思路"这词的词源
the origin of the phrase "train of thought."

225
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,320
现在我在想火车
Now I'm thinking about trains.

226
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,270
你在听他说话吗
Are you listening to this guy?

227
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,860
抱歉
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

228
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,400
我在想别的
I was somewhere else.

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,470
你个幸运的混蛋
Lucky bastard.

230
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,050
现在我在想果冻
Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

231
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,680
你怎么了
So what's up?

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,730
是关于伯纳黛特的事
It's a Bernadette thing.

233
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,430
不是吧  希望一切都好
Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.

234
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,180
不管怎样  我们都挺你的
Whatever it is, we're here for you.

235
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,340
你尽管畅所欲言
You can tell us anything.

236
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,690
对  不管是好事或悲剧
Yeah. Good or devastating.

237
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,940
我想求她嫁给我
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

238
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,950
-嫁给你  -什么
- Marry you? - What?

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,780
我只想找个好时机求婚
I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.

240
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,590
-还是等等吧  -别急  别急
- Oh, I'd wait.  - No rush, no rush.

241
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,420
太好了  是我表弟问我婚戒的事
Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring.

242
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,070
大卫  找得怎样
Hey, David, what'd you find?

243
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,880
没问题  半克拉就行
Sure, a half a caret's fine.

244
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,540
她那奇小的手  衬得啥都很大
Her freakishly small hands make anything look big.

245
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,840
这就是我爱她的其中一个理由
It's one of the reasons I love her.

246
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,500
天  他会大失所望的
Man, he's going to be blindsided.

247
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,010
我知道  绝对会很糟
I know. It'll be awful.

248
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,660
你为什么在笑
Why are you smiling?

249
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,720
对  拉杰  为什么
Yeah, Raj, why?

250
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,770
在我们印度  笑容有不一样含义
Uh, a smile means something different in my country.

251
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,340
比如高兴的泪水  悲哀的微笑
You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness.

252
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,040
印度是个傻地方
India's a goofy place.

253
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,230
哦  我又重新开始想火车了
Oh, I'm back to trains.

254
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,750
我有没告诉过你  我们实验室得到一笔拨款进行一项研究
Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?

255
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,730
-没有  -很赞的工作
- No. - Fascinating work.

256
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,840
我最近训练出一僧帽猴抽烟
I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.

257
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,370
研究到什么了吗
Have you learned anything?

258
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,420
有  它比不抽烟的猴子酷多了
Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys.

259
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,530
当然这也不算项比赛
Although it's not much of a contest.

260
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,440
其他猴子光会闲坐着手淫
The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.

261
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,620
你不介意的话
If you don't mind,

262
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,990
我想停止听你说话  开始发言
I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,570
当然
By all means.

264
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,450
霍华德刚宣布
Howard has announced his intention

265
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,200
他想向伯纳黛特求婚
to propose marriage to Bernadette.

266
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,470
我不明白
I don't understand.

267
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,560
八卦一开始不是说他们要分手吗
The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.

268
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,320
就是说啊
I know.

269
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,590
我们一致认为他的求婚
The group consensus is that his proposal

270
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,600
将遭到让他丢脸心碎的拒绝
will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection.

271
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,050
大家的心情都紧张得要命
Everyone was set a-twitter.

272
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,840
虽然很奇怪  却没人发微薄
Although oddly, no one tweeted.

273
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,140
我并不奇怪这个故事
It's not surprising that the story

274
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,460
已得到我们小小朋友圈里人的注意
has captured the attention of our little circle of friends.

275
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,460
你了解模因理论吗
Are you familiar with Meme Theory?

276
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,890
我什么不了解啊  但继续
I'm familiar with everything, but go on.

277
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,640
模因理论认为
Meme Theory suggests that

278
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,570
八卦内容就像生物
items of gossip are like living things

279
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,770
力图利用人类作宿主迅速繁殖
that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.

280
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,710
我很清楚模因传染病学
I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology.

281
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,570
在我就读的约翰逊小学
At Johnson Elementary School,

282
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,190
"谢耳朵是坨臭耳屎"这话就传播迅猛
the phrase "Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

283
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,530
我想也是
I should think so.

284
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,400
这句话真是绝了
That's gold.

285
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,120
模因假设并不吸引我
Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me.

286
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,830
不如我们更近地检测下
How might we examine this more closely?

287
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,390
想用人类作实验  你一点都不觉得内疚吗
Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?

288
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,520
这是极少几项跟人类相互交往
It's one of the few forms of interaction with people

289
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,470
不让我讨厌的
that I don't find repellent.

290
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,810
我们需要假造一则诱人的八卦
We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.

291
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,290
再造一则不诱人的八卦作为实验的控制组
And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.

292
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,400
然后追踪它在我们社交圈的发展情况
Then we'll track its progress through our social group

293
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,970
通过几项相互矛盾的理论来解释结果
and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms

294
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,890
如模因理论  代数八卦和传染病学
of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

295
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,900
看看你  居然让我开始研究社会科学了
Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences.

296
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,000
你真坏  艾米·费拉·福勒
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

297
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,760
嘿  艾米  有事吗
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

298
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,610
我和谢尔顿上床了
Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse.

299
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,510
还有  我想种个百草园
In other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden.

300
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,670
要保密哦  我走了
Mum's the word. Gotta go.

301
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,370
拉杰  你在这干嘛
Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?

302
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,040
就想一个人喝喝酒
I just felt like drinking alone,

303
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,780
因为我深沉黑暗
because I'm deep and dark.

304
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,760
霍华德没来吗
So, uh, Howard's not here?

305
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,180
没  又是只有我和你了
No. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me.

306
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,730
就像上次我们仨去看电影
Like when the three of us went to the movies,

307
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,330
因为红蔓卷绳糖和樱桃可乐
and you and I waited outside the bathroom

308
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,580
霍华德躲在厕所里吐  咱俩就在外面等着
while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

309
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,550
你还记得吗
Do you remember that?

310
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,370
记得
Yeah.

311
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,630
我也是
Me, too.

312
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,240
真是美好时光
Good times.

313
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,530
16桌要点头盘
16 wants to order appetizers.

314
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,040
-谢谢  -刚才的时光也很美好
- Oh, thanks. - This was nice.

315
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,460
你到底在这干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

316
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,720
霍华德是你最好的朋友  而那是他女友
Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend.

317
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
你真该为自己感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself.

318
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,420
我来的时候的确是
I was when I came in,

319
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,110
但美酒穿肠过  美人心中留
but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt.

320
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,110
还有你可能不知道
Besides what you might not know

321
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,860
伯纳黛特正准备跟霍华德分手呢
is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.

322
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,360
我知道  你又怎么知道的
Well, I know that. How do you know that?

323
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,330
我妹妹说的
My sister told me.

324
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,400
那个八卦的婊子
Oh, that gossipy bitch.

325
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,690
无意冒犯
No offense.

326
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,370
我不介意
None taken.

327
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,400
你真该听听她背后怎么说你的
You should hear how she talks about you.

328
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,440
好吧  听着
Okay, listen,

329
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,480
就算霍华德和贝纳黛特之间出了问题
just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems,

330
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,580
你也不应该在这四处打探
does not mean you should be here sniffing around.

331
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,490
我能怎么办  我脑子里想的都是她
What can I do? I can't stop thinking about her.

332
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,610
好吧  试着想想这个
All right, try thinking about this--

333
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,150
谢尔顿和艾米上床啦
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

334
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,950
闭上你的狗嘴
Shut your ass!

335
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,240
是真的  艾米亲口跟我说的
Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

336
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,740
怎么可能发生这事呢
How did that even happen?

337
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,520
他们干的时候
Did they know that's what they were doing

338
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,170
知道自己在干嘛吗
when they were doing it?

339
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,770
我猜他们应该是灵机一动  于是激情喷涌
I-I guess they just figurd it out at some point.

340
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,400
真不敢相信老处男臭耳屎终于开苞了
I can't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

341
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,160
希望你饿了
Hope you're hungry.

342
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,770
有意思
Interesting.

343
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,420
这个国家表示友好的方式
A friendly sentiment in this country,

344
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,040
在苏丹却是残酷的奚落
cruel taunt in the Sudan.

345
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,060
不同语境的教训啊
It's a lesson in context.

346
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,250
艾米会来跟咱们一起吃饭吗
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

347
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,690
应该会来吧
Yes, I believe so.

348
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,360
好  很好
Good, good.

349
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,220
你们俩  还好吧
Everything... okay between you two?

350
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,010
当然
Yes.

351
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,940
你问这个干嘛
Why do you ask?

352
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,250
没事随便问问
No reason.

353
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,490
我刚跟拉杰聊天
I was just talking to Raj,

354
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,020
他觉得艾米这几天容光焕发得不得了
and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.

355
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,900
他是说那种容光是因为照料百草园时
Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun,

356
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,510
没戴帽子或擦防晒  而被太阳晒成的吗
tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?

357
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
不是
No.

358
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,840
他说的重点不是这个
That's not what he meant.

359
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,030
那我们就不得而知了
Well, we may never know.

360
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,270
正如我母亲常说
As my mother would say,

361
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,390
亚洲人高深莫测呀
the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

362
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,840
不好意思  我还有工作要忙
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

363
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,090
你忙你忙
Yeah, you do.

364
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,780
小坏蛋  装毛呀装
You dog, you.

365
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,860
你听见了吗
Did you get that?

366
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,170
一字不差
Every word.

367
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,190
我们谣言八卦模因
Our false gossip meme

368
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,180
好像已经到达目录树中的节点表达式了
appears to have reached node lambda.

369
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,030
传递得比我们想象中要快
This is moving faster than we thought.

370
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,750
同意
Agreed.

371
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,400
似乎谣言的传播速率
It appears the rate of gossip transmission

372
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,450
与节点数量的二次幂成比例
is proportional to the number of nodes squared.

373
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,530
艾米  我不得不说
I must say, Amy,

374
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,180
假装跟你上床
pretending to have intercourse with you

375
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,960
让我的身心得到了极大的满足
is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.

376
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,480
慢点  谢尔顿  我还没啥感觉呢
Slow down, Sheldon. I'm not quite there yet.

377
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,690
-帮我递下酱油  -好的
- Pass the soy sauce. - sure

378
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,090
贝纳黛特刚向我打听咱俩上床的事
Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you.

379
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,490
模因全面插入[penetration也有阴茎插入的意思]
The meme has reached full penetration.

380
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,530
故意用的双关语吗
Pun intended?

381
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,520
不是  无心插柳柳成荫
No. Happy accident.

382
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
这次成果显著
This is remarkable.

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,040
还不到24小时
Took less than 24 hours.

384
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,940
我应该告诉你
I should let you know

385
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,010
她还问了咱俩调情的细节
that she asked for details about our dalliance.

386
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,260
真有意思
Interesting.

387
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,640
人们开始不满足于"上床"的字面意思
So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus

388
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,270
发展到要咱俩"越吹越爽"的细节了
to a "blow by blow," as it were.

389
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,150
故意用的双关语吗
Pun intended?

390
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,210
抱歉  什么双关
I'm sorry. What pun?

391
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,140
不说这个了
Not important.

392
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,770
我把你的做爱方式概括为"冷淡却高效"
I described your lovemaking as "aloof, but effective."

393
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,900
但愿你没有说出口
I wish you hadn't done that.

394
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
这话说得我跟一个少妇杀手一样
That's going to make me a chick magnet,

395
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,550
而事实上  我非常忙
and I'm so busy as it is.

396
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,870
大家注意啦
Hey, everybody,

397
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,510
我有话要问贝纳黛特
I got something I want to ask Bernadette,

398
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,570
现在大伙儿齐聚一堂
and I can't think of a better time

399
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,320
天时地利人和都最佳的时候
than when I'm with all my friends.

400
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,660
慢着  霍华德
Oh, hold on, Howard.

401
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,010
还有更多天时更好的
There's lots of better times.

402
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,640
莱纳德  拜托  他说话呢
Leonard, please. The man is talking.

403
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,610
让他说出来  别管后果如何
Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.

404
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,560
谢谢
Thank you.

405
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,220
贝纳黛特·玛丽安·罗森考斯基
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

406
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,940
天啊  这是什么回事
Oh, God. What's happening?

407
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,790
我知道我们的爱情不算完美
I know things haven't been perfect with us,

408
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,340
而且遇到了问题
and we've had our problems,

409
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,290
但我不得不告诉你  从我遇见你那刻
but I just have to tell you, from the moment I...

410
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,250
霍华德  你先别说
Howard, let me just stop you right here.

411
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,740
好戏上场
This is it.

412
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,440
我愿意
Yes.

413
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,070
你愿意什么
Yes, what?

414
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,220
我愿意嫁给你
Yes, I will marry you.

415
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,590
-你愿意?  - 你愿意?!
- You will? - You will?

416
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,010
我愿意!
I will.

417
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,030
我愿意!
I will!

418
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,070
我真的很爱你
Oh, I love you so much.

419
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,770
我也爱你
Oh, I love you, too.

420
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,500
恭喜你们
Congratulations!

421
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,030
这太激动人心了
Oh, it's so exciting.

422
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,380
[传说中印度人高兴的泪水....]

423
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,560
我真纳闷她为什么改变主意
I wonder what changed her mind.

424
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,650
或许是因为你对我非凡性能力的谈论
Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess

425
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,670
重燃了她对爱情的信心
renewed her faith in love.

426
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,880
没有比这更好的解释了
As good an explanation as any.

427
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
你戴着真漂亮
That's great...

428
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,020
嘿  艾米
Oh, hey, Amy.

429
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,120
伯纳黛特刚发短信给我
Bernadette just texted me.

430
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,550
霍华德求婚了
Howard proposed?

431
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,270
对  这个不重要  我只是路过
Yes, not important. Just stopped by

432
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,840
顺便告诉你一声  我准备做矫正术
to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

433
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,550
对了  我怀了谢尔顿的孩子
Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.

434
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,230
要保密哦
Mum's the word.

435
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,980
你怀孕了
You're pregnant?!

436
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,420
哇哦  还有提到矫正术吗
Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
