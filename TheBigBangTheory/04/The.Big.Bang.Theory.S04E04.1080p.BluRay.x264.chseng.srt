1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,170
我告诉你  如果氙能放射出紫外线
I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,560
那些有关暗物质的发现都会是错的
then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,470
那是  如果我们住在一个
Yes, well, if we lived in a world

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,380
缓慢运动的氙原子能放出光子的世界
where slow-moving xenon produced light,

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,430
那你就是对的
then you'd be correct.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,050
与此同时  猪能飞
Also, pigs would fly,

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,500
我也能拉出棉花糖来
my derriere would produce cotton candy,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,270
而《幽灵的威胁》也将成为永恒的经典
and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
星战前传一

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,430
你也太傲慢了
Oh, you're so arrogant.

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,420
如果你是超级英雄
If you were a superhero,

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,150
那你的名字就该叫傲慢上尉
your name would be Captain Arrogant.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,160
你知道你的超能力是什么吗
And you know what your superpower would be?

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,820
傲慢力
Arrogance.

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,890
你又错了
You're wrong again.

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,670
如果我的超能力是傲慢力
If my superpower were arrogance,

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,530
我的名字应该是至傲博士
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,310
我太喜欢看拉杰和谢尔顿一块儿工作了
I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.

18
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,520
没错  就好比异形和铁血战士决定
Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,870
合作开一间Jamba Juice一样
to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
Jamba Juice: 美国著名连锁冰沙奶昔店

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,610
你难道没注意宏观的状况吗
Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture?

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,590
-如果你看了中子分布数据  -佩妮
- If you look at neutron scattering data...  - Oh, Penny?

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,590
-佩妮  -怎么了
- Penny?  - What's up?

23
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,730
没事儿  我只是想让拉杰闭嘴而已
Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,350
不不不
No, no, no.

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,300
他赢了  憋着吧
He won. Suck it up.

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,570
我想问问你们是否需要甜品
Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert,

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,480
但我知道谢尔顿周二不吃甜品
but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays.

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,300
而拉杰就算想要什么也开不了口
And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me.

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,410
霍华德什么都不会点
Howard won't order anything,

30
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,370
但他会迸出来一些跟派或者芝士蛋糕
but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment

31
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,000
有关系的恶心话
involving the words pie or cheesecake.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,450
而莱纳德有乳糖不耐
And Leonard's lactose intolerant,

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,590
所以除非他想让自己的肠子
so he can't eat anything here

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,580
涨得跟动物气球似的  否则是什么都吃不了的
without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.

35
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,220
等等
Hang on a second.

36
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,800
我可以点水果拼盘的
I could have the fruit platter.

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,820
你想要水果拼盘
You want the fruit platter?

38
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,170
-上面有甜瓜吗  -有
- Does it have melon on it?  - Yeah.

39
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,950
呃  我不能吃甜瓜
No, I can't eat melon.

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,420
霍华德  注意了
Oh, Howard, heads up.

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,020
你的前女友来上班了
Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,770
你上次见她是什么时候
When was the last time you saw her?

43
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,190
分手之后就没见过了
Oh, not since we broke up.

44
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,090
嗯  我该怎么表现呢
Wow. How am I going to play this?

45
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,070
优雅而自然的
Sophisticated and relaxed?

46
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,630
还是友好而含糊的
Friendly, noncommittal?

47
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,230
或者冷淡且陌生的
Cold and distant?

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,670
你们好
Hi, guys.

49
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,560
你好
Hello.

50
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,640
看来你决定用悲剧和惊恐来面对了
I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.

51
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,380
这是他的拿手好戏
It's one of his best moves.

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,780

生活大爆炸第四季第四集

57
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,310
亲爱的  我们又见面了
So, my dear, we meet again.

58
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,930
好啊  霍华德
Hello, Howard.

59
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,410
我想你了
I've missed you.

60
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,640
我也想你了  凯蒂·萨克霍夫
I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》女主演之一

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,690
-问个问题  -随便问
- One question.  - Anything.

62
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,300
为什么我会在床上穿着《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》的战斗服
Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,740
那你又为什么你会和我同床呢
Why are you in bed with me?

64
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,100
如果我们开始质疑这个  那就太崩溃了
If we start to question this, it all falls apart.

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,180
不好意思
Sorry.

66
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,210
噢  强力地占有我吧  霍华德
Oh, ravish me, Howard.

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,510
我愿为你尽折腰
My loins ache for you.

68
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,600
好吧  既然你如此坚持的话
Okay, if you insist.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,900
霍华德  你看到我的束腹紧身裤了吗
Howard, have you seen my girdle?!

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,270
没有  妈
No, Ma!

71
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,850
我找不着了  而且减肥族大会就快要迟到了
I can't find it, and I'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!

72
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,700
也许它自杀了
Maybe it committed suicide!

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,420
少烦我
Leave me alone!

74
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,080
好了  刚才到哪儿了
Now, where were we?

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,880
我觉得你想要
I believe you were about

76
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,630
用你的牙齿扒下我的制服了
to rip off my uniform with your teeth.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,130
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?!

78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,700
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,530
我猜的话  估计是
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here

80
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,200
因为你今晚见到我了
because you saw me earlier this evening,

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,500
而你还对我有留恋
and you're still hung up on me.

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,880
才没有呢
No, I'm not.

83
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,550
很明显有
Clearly you are.

84
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,260
否则根据以往经验
Otherwise, based on past experience,

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,610
我们现在都该完事儿了
we'd be done by now.

86
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,830
好吧  我现在有点混乱了
Okay, I'm a little confused here.

87
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,670
亲爱的  我能帮什么吗
Oh, my. Can I help?

88
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,100
又不是那方面的困惑
Not that kind of confused.

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,740
武井乔治在这儿干嘛
What's George Takei doing here?
《星际迷航》中苏鲁的扮演者  本人为同性恋

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,380
霍华德  你有隐性的同性恋倾向吗
Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?

91
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,100
当然没有了
No, of course not.

92
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,810
你是这么说了
So you say.

93
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,420
而我却站在这儿了
Yet, here I am.

94
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,540
乔治  我问你个问题
George, let me ask you something.

95
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,780
作为科幻人物象征你是如何应对连续出演同类角色的
How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?

96
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,890
是很难
It's difficult.

97
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,990
作为演员你想拓展戏路
You try and stretch as an actor--

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,880
尝试下斯特林堡  奥尼尔什么的
do Strindberg, O'Neill,

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,150
但他们想要的只是"航线已设定  船长"
but all they want is, "Course laid in, Captain."

100
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,390
好好跟我说说
Tell me about it.

101
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,630
这太让我抓狂了
It's frackin' frustrating.

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,030
等等  凯蒂  你怎么走了
Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?

103
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,210
她走了是因为你内心深处想和我一起啊
She's leaving because you really want to be with me.

104
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,070
霍华德  我找到我的束腹紧身裤了
Howard, I found my girdle!

105
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,250
原来在烘干机里
It was in the dryer!

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,410
那太好了  妈妈
Great, Ma!

107
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,890
我觉得它缩水了
I think it shrunk!

108
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,940
我的赘肉就跟面团宝宝似的
I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
美国贝式堡公司的吉祥物

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,330
一想到那个画面
And with that mental picture,

110
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,130
我想今晚的精神治疗到此为止了
I think we're done for the evening.

111
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,990
你从没跟我说过你和伯纳黛特当初为何分手
You never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.

112
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,580
我做了件蠢事
I did a stupid thing.

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,430
我猜也是
Yeah, I guessed that.

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,730
像是那种现在难以面对她的蠢事
It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

115
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,830
你说的这范围广的可以从被窝里放屁
That covers anything from farting in bed

116
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,010
延伸到杀害流浪汉
to killing a homeless guy.

117
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,620
哦  我的天呐
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,860
你真碾死过流浪汉啊
You ran over a hobo.

119
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,770
没有  别问了
No. Stop asking.

120
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,890
好吧  你想跟她重归于好
All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her,

121
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,290
但却羞于面对她
but you're too ashamed to face her

122
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,660
就因为你曾经做了某件难以启齿的事
because of whatever it is you did.

123
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,950
-差不多  -好吧
- In a nutshell. - Okay.

124
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,870
那这么做你觉得怎样
Well, how about this?

125
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,630
你戴上诡异的面具从剧院里
Kidnap Bernadette from the opera
《歌剧魅影》的情节

126
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,840
把伯纳黛特劫走  这样她就认不出你了
wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,220
这么说吧  我不知道你是在跟我开玩笑还是怎么着
Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,410
你开始蛮横无理了
You're being unreasonable.

129
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,270
为什么我就不能有张桌子
Why can't I have a desk?!

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,570
我们的合作研究是思维上的工作
Our collaboration is a work of the mind.

131
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,390
我们用不着桌子
We don't need desks.

132
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,570
但你有桌子啊
You have a desk.

133
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,190
-是的  -但我就不能有了是吧
- Correct. - But I can't have one.

134
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,930
你说中要点了
You're two for two.

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,260
为什么他不能有桌子  谢尔顿
Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?

136
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,890
天呐  这一天怎么过不完了
Oh, Lord, will this day never end?

137
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,090
我已经再三向库萨帕里博士解释过了
As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali,

138
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,940
以他对美国俗语的理解能力  是不能明白
whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,260
什么叫做时机妥当的
when it's convenient.

140
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,150
我的预算中绝没有添置额外办公家具的那份了
There's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.

141
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,780
那你就有预算来买一抽屉的红蜡糖
Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines,

142
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,570
一把棉花糖步枪
a marshmallow shooting rifle,

143
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,390
以及带有夜光沙土的超级蚂蚁工坊[玩具]吗
and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?

144
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,550
是的
Yes.

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,490
好吧  那他出钱买自己的桌子呢
Okay, what if he buys his own desk?

146
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,700
是啊  要是我买我自己的桌子呢
Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?

147
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
-那太荒谬了  -为什么
- That's ridiculous. - Why?

148
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,230
因为...
Because...

149
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,760
请说
Yes?

150
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,050
这是我的办公室
It's my office.

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,760
-谢尔顿  -好了  好了
- Sheldon. - All right, all right.

152
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
他可以买他自己的桌子了
He can buy his own desk.

153
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,550
而且我可以放进你的办公室里
And I can put it in your office?

154
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,360
你还真的想得寸进尺了  是吧
Well, you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's, don't you?

155
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,500
为何你要买带夜光沙土的蚂蚁工坊呢
Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

156
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,030
因为蚂蚁有些工作晚上做更出色
They do some of their best work at night.

157
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,490
这个还能穿
Ah, it's okay.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,870
佩妮
Penny?

159
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,700
佩妮
Penny?

160
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,810
佩妮
Penny?

161
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,300
佩妮
Penny?

162
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,560
如果知道是我敲门你还会开吗
Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?

163
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,320
自从我发现
Not since I found out

164
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
你给我的泰迪熊安了摄像头之后就不会了
the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.

165
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,700
我只是有个问题想问
I just have a question.

166
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,260
伯纳黛特有跟你提起过我吗
Does Bernadette ever talk about me?

167
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,270
哦  当然有啊
Oh, absolutely.

168
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,400
-她提过吗  -当然
- She does? - Yeah, sure.

169
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,530
就在昨天  她还问我
Just yesterday, she asked,

170
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,830
为什么霍华德要躲在桌子底下
"Why is Howard hiding under the table?"

171
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,370
她看见了是吧
She saw that, huh?

172
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,410
没  没  一开始没有
Oh, no, not at first.

173
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,690
但在我告诉她后就...
Right after I pointed it out.

174
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,080
我问你点别的吧
Let me ask you something else.

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
她有跟谁交往吗
Is she seeing anybody?

176
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
据我所知没有吧
Oh, not that I know of.

177
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,410
既然说到了这个话题
Hey, while we're on the subject,

178
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,070
我想了解你们当初为何分手了
why did you guys break up anyway?

179
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,090
我觉得还是不说为好
Oh, I'd rather not say.

180
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,350
霍华德  你如果想得到我的帮助  就得让我知道
Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.

181
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,790
但说出来有些尴尬
But it's embarrassing...

182
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,110
是啊  我就期待着这个呢  进来吧
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.

183
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,100
好吧  你听过魔兽世界吧
Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?

184
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,930
那个网络游戏吗  当然
Um, the online game? Sure.

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,930
那你可否知道
Well, did you know

186
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,350
游戏中的角色是可以互相发生性关系的
that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?

187
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,820
哦天呐  我想我有点头绪了
Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.

188
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,250
她叫巨魔葛林新蒂
Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

189
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,790
当伯纳黛特来找我的时候
Bernadette walked in on me

190
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,420
我们正在灵魂之桥下翻云覆雨呢
while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.

191
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,240
你说的没错  这是够糗的了
Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.

192
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,330
你能跟她说说吗
Would you talk to her?

193
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,520
伯纳黛特还是巨魔
Bernadette or the troll?

194
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,970
伯纳黛特  她太生我气了
Bernadette. She was so mad at me,

195
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,110
她甚至都没听我的解释
she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.

196
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,370
那你的解释是什么
Well, what was your side?

197
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,540
那个巨魔葛林新蒂只是个虚拟的女人
Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman.

198
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,940
我是说  她也可能是个年届50在新泽西开卡车的人呢
I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.

199
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,460
真的假的  那这么说没让她消消气吗
Really? And that didn't make her feel better?

200
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,010
你能帮我去问问看吗   看看我们还有没有
Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all

201
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,830
重归于好的可能性了
we could get back together?

202
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,040
天  霍华德  我真不想趟你俩这趟浑水
Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.

203
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,890
别啊  你怎么忍心呢
No. Why would you?

204
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,690
我这个孤单的书呆子  和老妈相依为命
I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother,

205
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,700
努力寻求哪怕是一丝丝的幸福
trying to find any scrap of happiness he can.

206
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,570
也许是为了弥补
You know, maybe to make up for

207
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,290
11岁时父亲就离开他的缺憾吧
the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.

208
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,020
好吧  我会考虑的
Okay, I will think about it.

209
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,630
我一直在为父亲的出走
You know, I've always blamed myself

210
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,060
而深深自责
for him leaving.

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,470
我一直觉得那是因为他根本不想要我这个儿子
I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.

212
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,670
行了  我说了我会考虑的
Yeah, I said I'd think about it.

213
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,310
我体育不好  又有点病怏怏的
I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly...

214
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,570
行了  好了  我在给她打电话了  看见没
Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?!

215
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,010
谢谢
Thank you.

216
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,540
总之  霍华德请佩妮帮忙牵线伯纳黛特
So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette,

217
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,180
然后她照办了
and she did,

218
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,820
接着伯纳黛特同意跟他见面  一起喝杯咖啡
and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.

219
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,380
-我有个问题  -问吧
- One question.  - Yeah?

220
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,860
你干嘛跟我说这些
Why on earth are you telling me all this?

221
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,970
不知道
I don't know.

222
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,600
有时候你的动作如此栩栩如生
Sometimes your movements are so lifelike,

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,250
我都忘了你其实不是人
I forget you're not a real boy.

224
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,420
是你说我可以买张书桌的
You said I could buy a desk.

225
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,970
这东西压根不是书桌
This isn't a desk.

226
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,190
这是个...硕大无朋的怪物
This is a... Brobdingnagian monstrosity.

227
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,640
这是美国俗语里面对"巨大的书桌"的叫法吗
Is that the American idiom for "Giant, big-ass desk"?

228
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,380
其实是英式英语的说法
It's actually British.

229
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,520
能给我再说一遍吗
Can you say it again for me?

230
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
硕大无朋
Brobdingnagian.

231
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,330
再来一遍
One more time?

232
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,350
硕大无朋
Brobdingnagian.

233
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,810
来个三倍速的
Now three times fast?

234
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,870
硕大无朋  硕大无...
Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna...

235
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,030
你怎么把它给弄进来的
How did you even get it in here?

236
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,310
秘诀只有我  拉蒙和胡里奥  耶稣还有罗德里格知道
That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know

237
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,910
自己想哦
and you to find out.

238
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,590
好吧  你的立场明摆着了
All right, you've made your point.

239
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,870
很有意思的恶作剧
A fine prank, very amusing.

240
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,900
现在给我搬出去
Now get it out.

241
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,000
-不  -搬
- No.  - Yes.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,880
-不  -搬
- No.  - Yes.

243
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,920
-不  -搬
- No.  - Yes!

244
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,540
我有仨兄弟俩姐妹  谢尔顿
I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon--

245
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,720
磨嘴皮子你休想赢我
I can do this all day.

246
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,580
好吧  既然你不搬
All right, if you're not going to remove it,

247
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,090
我来给你搬
I'll remove it for you.

248
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,240
请自便
Knock yourself out.

249
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,860
帮我搬一下我的书桌
Help me move my desk.

250
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,890
-不  -搬
- No.  - Yes.

251
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,860
-不  -搬
- No.  - Yes.

252
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,980
不  这也过于硕大无朋了
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

253
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,560
你怎么会想把这东西弄来这儿
Why do you even want this here?

254
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,910
它的大小与用途完全不成比例
Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.

255
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,880
要说它的用途就是让你不爽的话
Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off,

256
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,260
我看真是恰到好处
I'd say it's spot-on.

257
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,910
好了  我明白怎么回事了
All right, I see what's going on.

258
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,590
你就是公开对我宣战
This is the opening salvo in what will be

259
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,900
接下来就是一系列越演越烈的幼稚的针锋相对
an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

260
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,120
这个回合你赢了
Well titted.

261
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,020
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

262
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,880
你给我走着瞧
Stand by for my upcoming tat.

263
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,570
谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon?

264
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,450
什么事
Yes?

265
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,440
不  没事
No.

266
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,360
发现没  我把这两句话给转过来了
See what I did there? I turned it around.

267
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,780
抱歉  我得打卡下班
Sorry, I had to clock out.

268
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,560
没事  没关系的
Oh, no, that's okay.

269
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,550
你过得怎么样
How have you been?

270
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,910
还好了  就是忙着读书上班什么的  你呢
Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?

271
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,120
一样  夏天时我选了一门戴水肺潜水的课程
Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer,

272
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,820
结果发现我很怕海
but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.

273
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,120
太糟糕了
Too bad.

274
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,780
你有没有认识的人
You wouldn't know anybody

275
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,180
想买大号儿童潜水衣的
who wants to buy a wet suit, boy's large?

276
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,640
算了  这不重要
Yeah, forget it. Not important.

277
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,840
你有跟人交往吗
So, are you seeing anyone?

278
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,570
-说实话  我  -嗨  在忙什么呢
- Well, to be honest, I...  - Hey, how are we doing over here?

279
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,490
要不要给你们点杯饮料
Can I get you something to drink?

280
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,250
-我不用  谢谢  -我也不用
- Not for me, thanks.  - I'm okay.

281
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,470
要不要点些吃的
Are you gonna want to order food?

282
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,290
-待会再点吧  -好的
- Maybe later.  - Okay.

283
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,370
那么  你在跟人交往吗
So, are you seeing anybody?

284
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,030
没有
No.

285
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,690
他问我的时候我也是这么说的
That's what I told him when he asked me.

286
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,930
希望这不算太冒昧吧
I hope that's not out of line.

287
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,990
-不  没事  -佩妮  能让我们独处一会儿吗
- No, it's fine.  - Penny, can we have a little privacy?

288
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,390
抱歉
Oh. I'm sorry.

289
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,630
你呢  你有没有跟其他人交往
What about you, have you been seeing anybody?

290
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,980
你知道  男人嘛
Well, you know how it is with guys.

291
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,210
总是有需要的
I mean, we have needs and...

292
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,870
这么说你在和其他女孩交往
So you've been seeing other girls?

293
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,060
不是真实的女孩
Well, not real girls.

294
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,300
你是说那个风骚的巨魔吗
Does that mean slutty trolls?

295
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,690
你们俩看起来很渴
You know, you look thirsty.

296
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,620
-我给你们拿了冰茶  -谢谢
- I brought you some iced tea.  - Thank you.

297
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,830
这是百香果  本店新品哦
It's passion fruit, new on the menu.

298
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,510
-我知道  我在这上班呢  -抱歉
- I know. I work here.  - Oh, sorry.

299
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,070
你说得对  这不明摆着嘛
Yeah, you're right. Doy.

300
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,850
霍华德  巨魔那事儿说不说
So, Howard, trolls yay or nay?

301
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,540
别老杵在这儿行吗
Isn't there somewhere else you can be?

302
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,610
那样我就听不着你俩聊天了
Not where I can hear you guys.

303
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,340
好吧  好了
Okay, fine.

304
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,940
我承认  在互联网的某些黑暗肮脏的角落
I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet

305
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,570
确实有人在喃喃呼唤沃罗法师这个名字
where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones.

306
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,940
我去那些地方不过是因为
The only reason I go there,

307
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,490
我曾那样做的唯一原因
the only reason I've ever gone there

308
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,460
是因为我生命中一直没有真正的女友
is because I don't have a real woman in my life.

309
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,450
-这下你爽了  -对  能放过你们一小会了
- You happy? - Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.

310
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,720
霍华德  你有过真正的女友
Howard, you did have a real woman.

311
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,440
我当时就在隔壁房间
I was right there in the next room

312
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,680
而你却疯狂地撸着鼠标跟巨魔进行剧烈运动
while you were clicking that troll's brains out.

313
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,220
对  但我们从未...
Yeah, but we weren't...

314
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,180
我是说  你我从未...
I-I mean, you and I never...

315
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,260
上过床
Had sex?

316
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,980
对
Yeah.

317
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,170
那又是谁的错呢
Well, whose fault was that?

318
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,620
免费赠送的墨西哥玉米片
Complimentary nachos!

319
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,800
慢慢享用
You enjoy.

320
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,920
从未上过床  哇
Never had sex?

321
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,930
你什么意思  问我那是谁的错
What do you mean, whose fault was that?

322
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,310
我们本可以上床的
Well, we could've been having sex,

323
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,040
但你从未主动采取行动
but you never made the move.

324
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,330
我以为是你不想我采取行动的
I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.

325
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,060
霍华德   女孩才不会跟你这样的人约会
Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you,

326
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,340
就你那长相  说话那德性  还有那小紧身裤
with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants

327
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,570
除非她是想让你主动采取行动的
if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.

328
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,940
真的吗
Really?

329
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,500
真的
Really.

330
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,990
妈的我早干嘛去了
Son of a bitch.

331
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,860
我真有点说不出口
Hey, this is a little awkward,

332
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,820
但经理说我无权免费赠送玉米片
but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away.

333
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,970
所以  谈好了记得买单啊
So... just take that when you're ready.

334
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,610
对  我俩谈得很愉快
Yeah, we had a really great talk,

335
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,710
决定重新开始约会
and we're gonna start seeing each other again.

336
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,430
恭喜你们
Oh, congratulations.

337
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,610
那你跟那巨魔分了吗
Have you broken it to the troll yet?

338
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,080
是佩妮告诉你的
Did Penny tell you about that?

339
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,400
不是  史蒂夫·帕特森说的
No. Steve Patterson told me.

340
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,150
设备管理部那恶心的老胖子
The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?

341
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,790
-对  -他怎么知道的
- Yeah. - How'd he know about it?

342
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,660
他就是巨魔葛林新蒂
He's Glissinda the troll.

343
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,070
抱歉兄弟  温度调节器在我这边
Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room,

344
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,760
温度就定在跟孟买一样热
so it stays Mumbai hot in here

345
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,180
除非你关了那愚蠢的印度音乐
until you turn off that stupid Indian music!

346
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,740
我自然会关了音乐
I'll turn off the music

347
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,320
只要你处理掉那只携带着沙门氏菌的鹦鹉
when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,960
太糟了  原来谢尔顿病态地怕鸟
Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds!

349
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,170
来看啊  谢尔顿  小鸟小鸟小鸟
Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!

350
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,680
我受够了  看我的棉花糖子弹  受死吧
That's it! Prepare for marshmallow death!

351
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,530
你也吃我一枪
Eat flaming Nerf!

352
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,890
话说回来...
So anyway...

353
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
你跟伯纳黛特能和好真是太好了
That's great news about you and Bernadette.

354
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,850
是啊  我想带她去打迷你高尔夫
Yeah. I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.

355
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,920
对你们来说  那就相当于正常的高尔夫了
Ah. I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.

356
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,260
笑我矮  真的吗
Short jokes? Really?

357
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,380
你也就比我高那么1/4英寸罢了
You're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.

358
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,290
对  记得我比你高就好
Yeah, and don't you forget it.

359
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,180
我过得很愉快
I had a good time.

360
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,800
我也是
Me, too.

361
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,590
跟她吻别
Kiss her good night.

362
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,540
好了  该来点舌吻了
All right, now a little tongue.

363
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,690
别轻举妄动
Hold on there.

364
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,100
我们才刚刚重燃爱火
We've only just rekindled the romance.

365
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,660
别让过早的唾液交换  破坏了这美妙一刻
Let's not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.

366
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,040
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

367
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,450
她也想要的
She wants it.

368
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,600
舌吻
Tongue.

369
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,340
看到了吧
See?

370
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,750
该主动出击了
Now make the move.

371
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,400
太快了
Too soon.

372
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,260
相信我  她准备好了
Trust me, she's ready.

373
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,470
主动出击
Make the move.

374
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,880
别
No, no, no.

375
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,810
女士都想被好好追求  慢慢献殷勤
A lady wants to be wooed,courted slowly.

376
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,670
你怎么知道的
How would you know?

377
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,420
书上看来的
I read.

378
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,900
听我的霍华德  是时候了
Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

379
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,820
主动出击  快
Make the move, now.

380
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,200
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

381
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,280
是你让我主动行动的  记得吗
You said... well, the "Move," Remember?

382
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,630
但不是现在
Oh, not now.

383
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,960
我们才刚重新开始
We're starting a new relationship.

384
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,060
我还需要重新了解你
I need to get to know you again.

385
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,190
不用重新了解的
No, you don't.

386
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,450
我还是我呀
It's me.

387
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,090
说话这副德性  还身穿小紧身裤的
The lusty charmer with the fancy patter

388
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,790
风流小可爱
and the hoochie pants.

389
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,040
耐心点  总有那么一天的
Be patient; we'll get there.

390
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,720
我就说嘛
Told you.

391
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,960
天  这什么味
Oh, God, what's that smell?

392
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,300
有事吗
Yes?

393
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,880
你们在那里面干嘛呢
What are you doing in there?

394
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,510
我正在制造硫化氢和氨气
I'm making hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gas.

395
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,120
只是个防治害虫的小实验罢了
Just a little experiment in pest control.

396
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,930
对付我没用的  兄弟  我可是在印度长大的
It's not gonna work, dude; I grew up in India--

397
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,110
那整片次大陆上  牛儿满大街乱窜
an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street,

398
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,210
就没个人能有过正常的"肠胃运动"
and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.

399
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,240
那就看看你还能坚持多久
Well, we'll just see how long you can hold out.

400
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,280
那我们就来看看你的有害气体
Well, we'll just see how your noxious gas

401
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,100
跟我的肉桂苹果芳香蜡烛  哪个更厉害
fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.

402
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,170
你不是说你在制造硫化氢气体
Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulfide gas?

403
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,190
-没错  -那不是很易燃的吗
- Yes. - Isn't that flammable?

404
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,450
极易燃
Highly.

405
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,780
哦天哪
Oh, dear.

406
