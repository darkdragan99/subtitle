1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,420
我不得不说  佩妮  这真有意思
I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,230
很高兴你玩得这么嗨
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,490
认识你和伯纳黛特前  我的洗手间之旅
Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,150
只有排泄这一个主题
had been entirely focused on elimination.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,560
现在又多了社交功能
Now they have a delightful social aspect.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,460
艾米  你之前肯定跟别的女生
Amy, you must've been in the bathroom

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,540
一起上过卫生间吧
with other women before.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,760
当然咯
Of course I have.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,660
但之前都是陌生人  而且在我
But they were strangers and seemed off-put

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,350
跟她们隔着小间闲聊时都很不高兴
when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
有些女生不喜欢在没穿内裤时
Some women don't like to get chummy

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,730
被人套近乎
when their panties are down.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,350
你在里面没事吧  闺蜜
You okay in there, bestie?

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,630
我没事
I'm fine...

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,970
我这么问你是因为很多人
The reason I ask is that many people

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,590
都会"膀胱羞涩"
experience bladder shyness;

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,180
就是在聊天的时候没法小...
the inability to pass uri...

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,150
喂  我说了我没事了  住嘴吧
Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,220
她小便的时候总是这么凶吗
She always this crabby when she urinates?

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,070
其实我俩没那么铁
We're really not that close.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
去他娘的  待会儿再说吧
Screw it. I'll go later.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,750
那我待会儿还来陪你
And I'll be right by your side.

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,710
我有没有跟你说过普丽娅邀请了
Did I tell you Priya invited

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,840
我和霍华德去跟她和莱纳德一起吃饭
me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,300
哦  不错啊
Oh, that's nice.

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,510
非也非也
No, it's not.

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,830
她在耍花招
It's a strategic maneuver.

28
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,050
莱纳德的新女友在检验伯纳黛特
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,190
对你和咱们的忠心呢
to you and the group.

30
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,550
那个贱人真狡猾啊
That bitch is crafty.

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,150
-真的吗  -当然
- You think? - Of course.

32
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,490
猎豹是怎么对付牛羚群的
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,360
追杀最弱小的成员
By going after its weakest member.

34
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
为啥我是最弱小的
Well, what makes me the weakest member?

35
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,060
因为你总轻信别人  而且身材瘦小
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.

36
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,710
你要是在塞伦盖蒂连一分钟都撑不到
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
塞伦盖蒂  非洲著名自然保护区

37
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,960
好吧  艾米  你这是在犯傻
Okay, Amy, you're being silly.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,320
谁跟谁一起吃饭我才不在乎呢
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,620
而且我肯定对莱纳德那个
And I certainly don't have a problem

40
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,580
总是化妆太浓的新女友没啥意见
with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.

41
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,970
呜  这鞋好漂亮
Ooh, these are cute.

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,270
当然我要是买下的话
Of course if I buy them,

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,290
我就得给同性恋夫妇当代孕妈妈了
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,110
无所谓了  我跟她说我去不了
It doesn't matter. I'm going to tell her we can't make it.

45
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,900
不行  你一定要去
Oh, no. You <i>have</i> to go.

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,810
我不懂了
I don't understand.

47
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
我以为我是那只瘦小的牛羚
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,270
没错  而且你还在用草莓香味的香波
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.

49
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,370
我们要充分利用这一点
And we're going to use that to our advantage.

50
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,790
打住  你到底在说什么
Wait. What are you talking about?

51
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,860
只要接受了邀请  伯纳黛特就成了
By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,180
敌营里的双面间谍
a double agent inside the enemy camp.

53
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,830
她可以洞悉普丽娅的诡计
She could ferret out Priya's tactics,

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,930
找到她的弱点
identify her weaknesses

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,280
并能提供假情报  比如
and feed her false information, such as:

56
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
莱纳德是地下斗鸡比赛的常客
Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.

57
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,620
不知道啊  我不怎么会撒谎的
I don't know. I'm not a very good liar.

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,200
在天主学校时就被罚得不敢撒谎了
They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,900
别担心  我来教你
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

60
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,170
我在童子军里待了两年
I did two years of Cub Scouts

61
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,100
都没让他们发现我是女生
before they found out I was a girl.

62
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,280
好吧  我不认识你们
Okay, I don't know you people.

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,720
我只是个天真的女生
I'm just an innocent woman wondering

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,410
不知这家鞋店能否用德士古加油卡
if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,720
你觉得在你的双峰之间藏一个
How do you feel about concealing a recording device

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,930
录音设备怎么样
in the cleavage of your ample bosom?

67
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,560
我双峰之间容不下任何东西
I don't want anything in my ample bosom.

68
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,670
来嘛  小草莓  为咱们牺牲一下呗
Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.

69
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,070

生活大爆炸第四季第二十二集

74
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,340
-好  待会儿见  -好消息
- Okay, see you later. - Good news.

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,100
我终于设计出了三人象棋
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.

76
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,030
确实是好消息  拜拜
That is good news. Bye.

77
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,400
你知道我是怎么解决
Uh, do you know how I solved

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,960
交战区域中心对称这个问题的吗
the balanced center combat-area problem?

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,990
很简单
Five words:

80
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,960
四边形向三角形的过渡镶嵌
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.

81
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,540
这  这个很赞
That... that's brilliant.

82
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,870
我就说嘛
It's what I do.

83
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610
等下  还有哈
But wait, there's more.

84
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,780
我还发明了两个新棋子
I also invented two new chess pieces.

85
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,420
毒蛇  和老妇
The serpent... and the old woman.

86
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,720
好吧  现在我非得问了  这俩怎么玩
Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,710
当毒蛇经过对方的棋子时
When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece,

88
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,800
那个棋子就算中毒了
that piece is considered poisoned

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,310
再走两步之后就会死掉
and will die after two more moves.

90
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,970
好吧
All right.

91
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,550
除非  它能及时赶到老妇身边
Unless... it gets to the old woman in time,

92
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,380
这样的话她就能吸出毒液
in which case she sucks out the poison,

93
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,160
并且自己变成太后
turning her into the Grand Empress:

94
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,000
老妇同时集合了
a piece combining the power

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,050
马  后和毒蛇三者的功效
of the Knight, Queen and Serpent.

96
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,350
妙极了
Elegant.

97
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,030
那是因为简单才妙
That's because it's simple.

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,930
好  很期待和你杀一局哦
Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.

99
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,980
还有
And...

100
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,540
还有啥
And what?

101
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,670
第三个人啊
And a third person.

102
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,090
这是三人象棋嘛
It's three-person chess.

103
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,590
我不得不说  自从你开始
I must say, ever since you started

104
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,640
定期交媾之后  你的脑子就没那么好使了
having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge.

105
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,780
你应该采取点儿措施的
You should reflect on that.

106
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,020
抱歉  可爱因斯坦性生活也很频繁啊
Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.

107
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,860
所以他没能把引力和其它力统一起来
Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces.

108
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,930
他要是不这么乱搞
If he hadn't been such a hound dog,

109
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,110
我们早就有时光机器了
we'd all have time machines.

110
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,910
知道了  拜
Got it. Bye.

111
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,590
你知道哥是对的
You know I'm right.

112
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,640
他的病情又加重了
I think he's getting worse.

113
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,060
嗷  我的跖骨在哀嚎
Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

114
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
-你还好吗  -没事
- You okay? Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,540
我只是穿了双新鞋而已
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.

116
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,590
-很漂亮  -谢谢
- Very pretty. - Thank you.

117
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,940
你知道女人穿高跟鞋
Did you know that women wear high heels

118
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,270
是为了更加前凸后翘吗
to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?

119
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,390
还真没这么想过
Hadn't really thought about it.

120
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,910
瞧
Look.

121
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,370
呃  没错  相当...翘
Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

122
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,030
拜托  莱纳德  别乱瞟了
Please, Leonard, don't leer,

123
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,060
你有女友了
you have a girlfriend.

124
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,820
抱歉
Sorry.

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,890
你要和普丽娅  霍华德
So, are you off to dinner

126
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,420
伯纳黛特共进晚餐吗
with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,320
是啊  你怎么知道的
Yeah. How did you know?

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,130
我在商场听说的
I heard it at the mall,

129
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,480
当时正和闺蜜们一起血拼
when I was shopping with my girlfriends,

130
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,630
这基本上就是我现在的生活状态了
'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now.

131
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,800
祝你有愉快的一晚
Have a good night.

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,750
我转身离开时  尽量别偷瞄我的翘臀
Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.

133
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,240
拉杰  你要和我们共进晚餐吗
Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
孤家寡人跟两对甜蜜鸳鸯掺和吗
The lonely guy and the two happy couples?

135
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,220
我还不如找个猥琐男
I'd rather get a prostate exam

136
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,880
帮我做前列腺检查直到他断指呢
from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.

137
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,350
你能不能不要顾影自怜了
Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?

138
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,830
我也是迫于无奈
I have to feel sorry for myself.

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,530
因为我是唯一关心自己的人
I'm the only one who cares.

140
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,690
就像我是唯一愿意和自己做爱的人一样
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.

141
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,060
你怎么能在你妹妹面前说这种话
Really? In front of your sister?

142
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,400
我们从小住在一个房间
We shared a room growing up.

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,630
我都听习惯了
This is not news to me.

144
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,930
失陪了  我要去街上独自闲逛一会
Excuse me. I'm going to go wander the streets alone.

145
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,200
无人关注  无人需要  无人爱怜
Invisible, unwanted and unloved.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,620
都市里的一剪孤影  无牵无挂
A pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.

147
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,980
我忘穿防风夹克了  外面怪冷的
I forgot my windbreaker. It'chilly.

148
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,520
我就不明白了  新鞋就这样穿的吗
I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?

149
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,630
不  但这对小宝贝一旦沾地
No. Once these puppies touch the ground

150
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,960
就属于我了  我就要穿着它们
they're mine, and I'll have to wear them

151
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,490
在好莱坞大道徘徊
walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard

152
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,260
好让它们物有所值
in order to pay them off.

153
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,560
美啦  美啦  美啦
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

154
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,800
好消息  牛羚到达印度人家了
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.

155
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,420
神马
The what?

156
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,670
伯纳黛特同普丽娅和莱纳德碰面了
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.

157
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,020
短信已收到
Message received.

158
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,270
启动"普丽娅不想步你后尘"行动
Commence operation "Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

159
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,700
你不至于吧
Hey. Seriously?

160
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,130
你高中没玩够这种小团体把戏吗
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?

161
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,200
我倒也想  但组小团体是需要朋友的
I wish. A clique requires friends.

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,690
-而我却没有  -一个都没有吗
- I didn't have any. - None?

163
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,050
我以前会把午餐带到保全室
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room

164
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,460
和清洁工一起吃
and eat with the janitor.

165
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,710
那种感觉很好  直到他老婆骂我"贱货"
It was nice until his wife called me a <i>puta</i>

166
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,210
将我拒之门外
and made me stop.

167
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,720
等等
Hang on.

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,540
是牛羚发来的
It's the wildebeest.

169
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,030
普丽娅刚刚挖苦了一番你的演艺事业
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.

170
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,100
她都说什么了
W-What the hell did she say?

171
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
她认为  了不起的是你勇于追梦
She thinks it's cool you're following your dream,

172
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,550
不管这有多难
no matter what.

173
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,790
贱人!
That bitch!

174
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,470
你想怎么应对
How do you want to handle it?

175
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,750
呃  好吧
Um, okay.

176
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,390
让伯纳黛特告诉普丽娅
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that

177
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,230
我在去布拉格的路上
I'm on my way to Prague

178
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,760
准备去和安吉丽娜·朱莉拍电影
to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.

179
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,860
明白
Got it.

180
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
是3D电影吗
Is it going to be in 3-D?

181
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,110
什么  无所谓  这个不重要
What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

182
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,280
还是说3D电影吧
I'm gonna say 3-D.

183
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,700
可以让她知道制片方对电影很有信心
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.

184
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,510
开什么玩笑  竟然是3D的
You're kidding. 3-D?

185
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,230
听说是这样的
That's what I hear.

186
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,960
那制片方一定对电影很有信心
Then the studio must have real faith in it.

187
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,080
她为什么没告诉我呢
Wonder why she didn't <i>tell</i> me.

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,340
你最近经常和你的前女友接触吗
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?

189
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,680
没有
No...

190
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,650
那她没告诉你有什么好奇怪的
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?

191
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,280
与其说是"奇怪"
Well, it's not as much "surprised" as...

192
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,550
不如说是  另一种感觉
you know... uh... the other thing.

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
什么感觉
What other thing?

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,470
如果你  呃
Well, if you... uh...

195
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,100
我不
I don't... oh...

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,910
我想说的是哪个词来着
What's the word I'm looking for?

197
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,290
我不会帮你的  看你的囧样太欢乐了
I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.

198
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,900
她还在和宇航员谈恋爱
She's also dating an astronaut.

199
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,830
哇哦  这么厉害啊
Wow. That's very impressive.

200
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,180
是啊  但莱纳德也很厉害啊
Yeah. But Leonard's impressive, too.

201
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,470
谢谢
Thank you.

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,630
糊涂
"Befuddled."

203
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,340
"糊涂"这个词很合适
The word I was looking for was "befuddled."

204
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,940
马走到老妇...
Knight to Old Woman...

205
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,390
6又1/3位置
six-and-a-third.

206
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,090
妙棋
Brilliant move.

207
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,000
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

208
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,680
两位失陪一下
Will the two of you excuse me?

209
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,000
抱抱我吧
I need a hug.

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
抱歉  我家有客人
Sorry, I have company.

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
拜托  谢尔顿  开开门
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

212
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,640
我不想抱你
I don't want to hug you.

213
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,720
我也不想抱你
I don't want to hug you, either.

214
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
我只是感觉很郁闷[蓝色]
I was just feeling blue.

215
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,980
蓝色  就是郁闷的意思
Blue, as in depressed.

216
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,430
还没郁闷到孤独的地步
Well, not so much depressed as lonely.

217
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,740
我不知道孤独是什么颜色
I don't know what color lonely is.

218
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,360
-什么  -红色代表愤怒
- What? - Red is angry;

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,790
黄色代表惊恐
yellow is frightened;

220
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,880
绿色代表嫉妒  蓝色代表忧郁
green is jealous; and blue is depressed.

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,060
没准咱可以找个颜色来代表孤独
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,820
橙色跟啥都不押韵  没准橙色也觉得挺孤独的
Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.

223
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,340
好吧  进来吧
All right. Come in.

224
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,130
你看起来的确挺橙挺孤独的
You look positively orange with loneliness.

225
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,940
不行  说起来还是不顺嘴
No, I don't see that catching on at all.

226
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,550
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

227
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,560
我在研究我的三人国际象棋
I'm working on my three-person chess game.

228
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,370
真酷  我能一起玩吗
Oh, cool. Can I play?

229
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,080
这是三人象棋
It's three-person chess.

230
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,670
你带朋友来了吗
Did you bring a friend?

231
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,450
没
No.

232
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,070
那我就只好请你思考一下
Then as a mental exercise I invite you

233
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,310
为啥咱俩人
to figure out why the two of us

234
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,380
没法玩三人象棋了
can't play three-person chess.

235
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,040
这家伙够迷糊的吧
Can you believe this guy?

236
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,150
然而鉴于人际交往的需要
Social protocol does, however,

237
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,010
我应该在你孤独的时候
require me to bring you a hot beverage

238
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,230
给你来杯热饮
in your time of need.

239
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,300
不用了  谢谢  我没事
No, thank you. I'm fine.

240
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,160
你没的选择
It's not optional.

241
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,030
我们家没茶了  但愿你喜欢牛肉汤
We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.

242
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,850
我猜你大概在琢磨
I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering

243
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,020
我为什么会这么郁闷
what's got me down.

244
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,870
实际上我在琢磨
Actually, I was wondering

245
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,570
我能不能再加一个新的棋子
if I could add a third new chess piece.

246
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,800
你觉得我加个乔伊王子怎么样
How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey--

247
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,810
他是国王弱智但却心地善良的表弟
the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?

248
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
我就快三十岁了
I'm going to be 30 years old,

249
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,050
但我却找不到一个爱我的人
and I have no one in my life to love me.

250
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,860
我真是没救了  我不喝酒的话
I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman

251
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,100
都没法开口跟女人讲话
without having alcohol in my body.

252
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,850
乔伊王子有趣的地方就在于
The fun thing about Prince Joey

253
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,100
他每动一次  就有百分之二十的几率
is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance

254
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,070
会自杀
he'll kill himself.

255
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,260
谢尔顿  听我说
Sheldon, listen to me.

256
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,260
我要做个重大的决定  而我很害怕
I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.

257
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,700
很黄很害怕  说吧
Yellow. Go ahead.

258
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,910
我在药学院的一个朋友
A friend at the School of Pharmacology

259
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,580
给了我这些他们正在测试的药
gave me these new pills they're testing.

260
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,990
他说这将是治疗社交焦虑障碍领域的
He says it's the next big thing

261
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,830
又一奇迹
for social anxiety disorder.

262
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,270
有意思  这药是什么成分的
Fascinating. What's in it?

263
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,150
我也不知道
I'm not sure.

264
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,450
某种β受体阻断剂跟从牛的尿液中
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule

265
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,940
提取的分子的混合物
extracted from the urine of cows.

266
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,190
我喜欢牛
I like cows.

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,960
这不是重点
That's not the point.

268
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,920
你怎么想不重要  继续说吧
It was its own point. Go on.

269
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,000
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
我靠我的思考能力吃饭
My ability to think is my bread and butter.

271
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,120
我怕我吃了这个药以后  可能会丧失那些
I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose

272
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,240
让我在我的领域里
that special, unique something

273
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,730
如此成功的特质
that makes me so successful in my field.

274
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,150
拉杰  我有幸
Rajesh, I've had the privilege

275
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,240
跟你一起共事了多年
of working alongside you for many years.

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,880
我建议你就跟吃糖豆一样
My recommendation is that

277
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,580
把这些药都吞了吧
you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

278
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,790
好吧  我还在琢磨这事呢
Okay, I'm still trying to work this out.

279
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,100
佩妮是怎么搭上一个宇航员的
How did Penny meet an astronaut?

280
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,960
我也不知道
I don't know.

281
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,380
就正常这么搭上的呗
The regular way people meet astronauts.

282
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,460
宇航员大多都住在德克萨斯州呀
Most of those guys live in Texas.

283
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,050
显然这哥们儿不住那儿
Obviously, this one doesn't.

284
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,370
好吧
Okay.

285
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,020
莱纳德住在美国  而普丽娅是印度来的
Leonard lives here. Priya's from India.

286
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,400
结果不也认识了嘛  霍华德  你搞什么
People meet, Howard. God!

287
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,440
好吧
Fine.

288
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
你也认识过不少宇航员
You've met lots of astronauts,

289
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,060
我可从来都没拷问你是怎么认识的
and I've never grilled you about that.

290
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,190
谢谢你以怨报德
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,250
我没拷问你  我只是好奇而已
I'm not grilling you; I was just curious.

292
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,130
我还在琢磨她居然要出演大片这件事呢
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.

293
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,650
倒不是因为我在乎我前女友的事  我真不在乎
Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.

294
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,650
也许她就是在片场认识那个宇航员的呢
Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?

295
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,710
不好意思  可是宇航员
I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing

296
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,370
跑到片场去干嘛呀
working on a movie?

297
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,090
他是顾问
He's a consultant.

298
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,180
你不是说这部电影是关于十八世纪的维也纳的吗
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.

299
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,380
他就不能有点业余爱好吗
He can't have a hobby?!

300
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,950
失陪一下  我要去洗手间了
Excuse me, I have to pee.

301
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,630
你们是不是觉得这件事也很不可思议
Or is that implausible, as well?!

302
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,630
两对情侣一起玩就是好  对吧
It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?

303
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,070
好了  宝贝儿  你们得回家了
All right, guys, you have to go back.

304
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,480
我可负担不起你们
I can't afford you.

305
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,070
不  别抛弃我们  我们爱你
No, don't send us away; we love you.

306
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,340
我也爱你们  但你们比我的房租还贵
I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent.

307
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,810
但是佩妮  你穿上我们之后很漂亮呀
But, Penny, you look so good in us.

308
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,270
该死的  鞋说的对
Damn it, the shoes are right.

309
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,910
天啊  佩妮  你还是真是鬼点子多多呀
Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.

310
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,450
进展如何了  牛羚
What do you got for me, wildebeest?

311
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,840
我觉得他们在逼问我
I think they're on to me.

312
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,950
这故事开始漏洞百出了
The story's starting to fall apart.

313
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,910
冷静点  没事的
Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.

314
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,590
我们或许得杀她灭口了
We may have to kill her.

315
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,950
伯纳黛特  我开免提了
Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone.

316
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,770
你在哪呢
Where are you now?

317
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,820
在洗手间
In the bathroom.

318
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,760
不错嘛
Oh, look at this,

319
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,310
又一次经典的洗手间对话
another one of our classic bathroom gabfests.

320
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,910
到底是怎么回事
What's the problem?

321
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,710
他们在问我
They're just asking me

322
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,010
一堆我回答不上来的问题
all sorts of questions I can't answer.

323
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,750
那就换话题呀
Just change the subject.

324
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,720
我想我应该可以让他们继续聊
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard

325
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,100
莱纳德去印度见普丽娅父母的事
going to India to meet Priya's parents.

326
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,800
什么
What?!

327
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,070
他们好像说今年夏天一起去印度
They said something about going there this summer.

328
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,810
什么  他们要订婚吗
What, are they getting engaged?

329
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,700
我不知道  我忙着自圆其说呢
I don't know. I was too busy covering my heinie

330
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,180
都是艾米说什么宇航员害的
on Amy's stupid astronaut story!

331
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,080
什么宇航员
What astronaut story?

332
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,240
你短信说佩妮在跟个宇航员约会
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.

333
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,010
我发的是"建筑师"  真好玩
I texted "architect." That's amusing.

334
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,960
肯定是自动纠错帮我改的
Auto-correct must've changed it.

335
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,890
是啊  太好笑了
Yeah, it's hysterical.

336
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,540
好吧  反正别提宇航员的事了
All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.

337
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,870
是建筑师  你上哪去认识宇航员
Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?

338
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,680
一定要问去印度怎么回事就好了
Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.

339
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,090
我再也不想干这事了
I don't want to do this anymore!

340
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,780
你敢
Don't you quit on us!

341
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,080
妮妮  你没事吧
Bernie, you okay?

342
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,570
原来是个建筑师
It was an architect!

343
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,810
谢谢你陪我来  谢尔顿
Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon.

344
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,970
真够朋友
You're a good friend.

345
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,370
很高兴你这么想
I'm glad you think so.

346
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,630
我就是想让你这么认为
That's what I strive to emulate.

347
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,730
好吧  来看看这药有没有效
Okay, let's see if this drug works.

348
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,900
有事吗
Can I help you?

349
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,590
抱歉这么盯着你看  你太美了
Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.

350
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,530
谢谢
Thank you.

351
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,530
你口音真好听  你家乡是
That's a great accent. Where are you from?

352
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,380
印度
India.

353
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,880
真好  我一直想去那儿
Oh, cool. I've always wanted to go there.

354
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,830
印度很漂亮  你一定会喜欢的
It's a beautiful country. You'd love it.

355
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,710
能坐这里吗
May I join you?

356
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,540
好的  当然  有何不可
Uh, okay, sure. Why not?

357
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,150
我是拉杰·库萨帕里博士
My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

358
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,440
这位是我朋友谢尔顿·库珀博士
and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

359
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,240
不用理我
There's no need to interact with me.

360
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,080
我只是来观察的
I'm just here to observe.

361
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,400
他在观察什么
What's he observing?

362
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,970
我们是科学家  啥都观察的
We're scientists. We observe everything.

363
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,710
给  去买个松饼吃
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

364
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,560
好吧
All right.

365
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,970
-那你叫什么  -安吉拉
- And what is your name? - Angela.

366
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,540
这名字来源于天使  很恰当
Oh, derived from the word "angel." Appropriate.

367
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,270
你真可爱
You're cute.

368
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,250
我要买个松饼
I'd like to buy a scone.

369
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,510
抱歉  卖完了
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

370
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,760
还有小松饼要吗
We have muffins.

371
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,120
听起来很好吃
They sound delicious,

372
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,010
但这钱是专用来买松饼的
but this money is earmarked for scones.

373
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,950
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

374
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,660
只是觉得这样舒服
Oh, just getting comfortable.

375
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,980
你在洛杉矶住多久了
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?

376
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,640
我...
I...

377
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,880
松饼卖完了
They were out of scones.

378
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,210
谢尔顿  我在跟人说话
Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

379
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,600
你这样太没礼貌了
You're being rude.

380
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,270
我敢打赌你肯定是演员
I'll bet you're an actress.

381
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,490
不是的话太可惜了
If not, you should be.

382
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,170
你有这么出众的脸蛋
You have a very expressive face.

383
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,670
天哪
Oh, my God.

384
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,510
等等  你这是去哪儿
Wait, where are you going?

385
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,970
我们挺聊得来的啊
We were doing so well.

386
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,760
她还没来得及见我小弟弟呢
She never even got to see my penis.

387
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,660
谁还要咖啡
Who wants some more coffee?

388
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,230
-谢谢  我要  -我也要
- Thanks, yeah. - Sure.

389
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,410
我来帮你吧
Let me help you.

390
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,080
很高兴女孩子们相处融洽
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.

391
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,700
"女孩子们"
"Gals"?

392
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,800
你谁呀  摩登原始人吗
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

393
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,250
印度之旅一定会好玩的
This trip to India sounds fun.

394
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,990
是啊  我也这么觉得
Yeah, I think it will be.

395
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,850
你担心自己父母不接受莱纳德吗
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?

396
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,990
有点
A little.

397
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,640
他们挺守旧的
They're very old-fashioned.

398
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,410
换我就不会担心
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

399
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,040
你们又不是去订婚  是吧
It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?

400
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,330
天哪  不是  我们还没到那阶段
Oh, God, no. We're not there yet.

401
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,290
不是订婚  有意思
Not engaged. Very interesting.

402
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,380
我要去趟洗手间
I have to tinkle.

403
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,200
你今晚去过好多趟了  没事吧
You've been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?

404
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,880
没事  你准备写进书里吗
Yes. Are you writing a book?

405
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,950
你为什么这么生气
Why are you getting upset?

406
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,070
我才没生气  你才生气
I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.

407
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,160
你怎么了
What's up with you?

408
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,510
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?

409
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,290
我再也做不下去了
I can't do this anymore!

410
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,410
我是个好女孩
