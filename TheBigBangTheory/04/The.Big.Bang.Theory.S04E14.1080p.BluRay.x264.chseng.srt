1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,870
晚上好
Good evening.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,570
我是你们的客座讲师  谢尔顿·库珀博士
I'm your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,510
我还等着掌声呢
I was expecting applause,

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,420
不过"王八之气"震慑后的安静也挺好的
but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,280
我之所以今晚愿意来给你们上课
I agreed to speak to you this evening,

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,720
是因为有人告诉我你们是这所学校里的
because I was told that you're the best and the brightest

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,860
博士生中最优秀最聪明的
of this university's doctoral candidates.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,160
当然  这就像是说
Hmm. Of course, that's like saying

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,780
你们是氢原子中最重要的电子一样
you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,270
因为  你们想啊
'Cause, you see,

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,410
氢原子只有一个电子
there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,420
这也算最优秀最聪明啊  我的老天爷
Best and brightest, my sweet patootie.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,030
好吧  开始上课
All right, let's begin.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,300
请举手告诉我  在座的哪位
Show of hands, who here is familiar

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,490
对拓扑绝缘体的概念比较熟悉
with the concept of topological insulators?

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,000
别自欺欺人了
Don't kid yourselves.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,720
我又看到了一条谢尔顿课上的学生的微博
I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,230
"库珀博士选择的话题相当无聊
"Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,220
并且他成功地升级到了令人无法忍受的地步
and managed to make it completely insufferable.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,980
另外  他看起来像只大昆虫"
Plus, he looks like a giant insect."

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,300
听着  听听这条
Look. Listen to this one.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,560
"爱因斯坦的理论是不是揭示了为什么
"Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,910
当你快乐时时间飞逝
when you're having fun,

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,800
而当你听库珀博士说话时
but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper,

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,840
时间就慢得要命"
it falls out of the sky, dead?"

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,890
有人拍了照
Ooh, somebody took pictures

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,000
还上传到了Flickr上
and uploaded them to their Flickr account.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,420
哇
Wow.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,920
你要怎么做才能让整个演讲大厅里的人
How do you get an entire lecture hall

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,100
同时冲你竖中指啊
to flip you off at the same time?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,070
显然啊  如果你是谢尔顿的话
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,060
你需要做的只是转个身而已
all you need to do is turn your back.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,100
莱纳德  你家Wi-Fi坏了吗
Hey, Leonard, is your Wi-Fi down?

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,020
我连不上啊
I can't get on.

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,600
哦  谢尔顿把密码改了
Oh, Sheldon changed the password.

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,110
现在是"佩妮是个蹭网的"
It's now "Penny is a freeloader."

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,590
别加空格
No spaces.

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,410
多谢  你们在干嘛呢
Thanks. What are you guys doing?

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,080
谢尔顿今晚在学校里上课
Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,240
我们在看评论
We're reading the reviews.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,850
他表现如何啊
Oh. How'd he do?

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,760
想象一下"兴登堡"号飞艇爆炸加上切尔诺贝利核泄漏
Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,600
加上三里岛核泄漏再加上《电子世界争霸战2》
meets Three Mile Island meets <i>Tron 2.</i>

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,720
有那么糟啊
That bad, huh?

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,440
念一下这个女生的微博
Read this woman's tweet.

46
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,440
"听库珀博士讲课
"Listening to Dr. Cooper

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,690
让我又想自残了"
has made me want to start cutting myself again""

48
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,180
是吧
Yeah.

49
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,320
晚上好  莱纳德  霍华德  拉杰
Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj,

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,660
蹭网的
freeloader.

51
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,960
课上得怎么样啊
So, how'd the lecture go?

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,690
一言以蔽之  大获全胜啊
In a word, triumphant.

53
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,760
真的吗  大获全胜
Really? Triumphant?

54
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,120
可不是吗  你们真该亲眼看看那群孩子
Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,700
求知若渴  贪婪地聆听我的教诲
Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom.

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,070
我今天也许改变了不少人的人生
I may have changed a few lives today.

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,790
求你让我告诉他吧
Oh, please let me tell him.

58
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,680
我不知道行不行啊  我答应了霍华德的
I don't know, I kind of promised Howard.

59
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,120
告诉我啥
Tell me what?

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,830
其实呢  我们应该一起分享这一刻
Actually, we should all share the moment.

61
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,370
拉杰  你来吧
Raj, if you would.

62
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,900
关于我的课的微薄啊
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

63
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,210
这条很不公平
That's rather unfair.

64
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,070
这条太伤人了
That's downright cruel.

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,260
而且  昆虫都有六条腿
Plus, insects have six legs.

66
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,570
我不是很清楚"KMN"这个缩写是啥意思
Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym "KMN""

67
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,040
根据语境  我们觉得是"快杀了我吧"
From the context, we think it means "kill me now."

68
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,350
我觉得每个人都有权表达自己的观点
Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

69
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,480
我还是去睡觉吧
I think I'll turn in.

70
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,560
反正我也不想教那群榆木脑袋了
I didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,170
顺便说一句  我觉得这句话是达斯·维达
FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said
星战情节

72
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,170
在建造死星之前说的
just before he started building the Death Star.

73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,340

生活大爆炸第四季第十四集

78
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,880
谢尔顿还在郁闷吗
Sheldon still moping?

79
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,550
是啊  好奇怪  就算他一开始就不想
Yeah, it's weird. Even though he didn't want

80
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,900
给这帮学生上课
to give the lecture in the first place,

81
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,350
被他们拒绝还是打击挺大的
being rejected by those students really hit him hard.

82
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,760
这感觉我深有体会
I know the feeling.

83
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,510
就好像无意中走进了一家同性恋酒吧
It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar

84
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,510
然后发现没人对你有兴趣
and then having no one hit on you.

85
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,680
这  这是我一个朋友的经历
It-It happened to a friend of mine.

86
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,000
你们还好吗
Are you guys doing okay?

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
莱纳德和我还好
Leonard and I are fine,

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,380
但我觉得拉杰现在真的急需一位小妞
but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,540
这不是什么难事
Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

90
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,980
他这么可爱
He's such a cutie.

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,730
谢谢夸奖  但是"可爱"是形容小兔子的
Thank you, but "cute" is for bunnies.

92
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,520
我想要能吸引异性
I want to be something with sex appeal,

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,370
就像  就像拉布拉多犬一样
like... like a labradoodle.

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,620
拉布拉多犬
Labradoodle?

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,710
我们估计得从头考虑你的问题了
We might be starting to zero in on your problem.

96
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,170
别听他们的
Don't you listen to them.

97
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,030
你对异性有足够的吸引力
You've got plenty of sex appeal.

98
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,040
你真这么觉得吗
You really think so?

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,080
是啊  你好性感哦
Yeah. You're a hottie.

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,590
谢谢  伯纳黛特
Well, thanks, Bernadette.

101
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,010
顺便告诉你们
And just for the record,

102
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,500
拉布拉多犬是防过敏的
labradoodles are hypo-allergenic,

103
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,440
这对于那些深受动物毛屑困扰的人来说很性感
which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.

104
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,590
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

105
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,400
很炫的视觉效果  但是我还是不高兴
It's a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,260
就算我这么做都没用吗
Not even when I do this?

107
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,480
没用
No.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,270
这是我搞怪的压箱底招了
Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
你知不知道  教书是我自从1989年3月
Do you realize that teaching is the first thing

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,670
做引体向上失败以后
I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt

111
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,770
搞砸的第一件事
to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?

112
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,790
如果这次丢人的经历
If this humiliating experience

113
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,970
真的让你很困扰的话
is really troubling you,

114
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,830
我们还是有办法解决的
there are things we could do about it.

115
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,360
比如
For instance?

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,930
首先想到的
Well, the first thing that comes to mind

117
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,310
就是隔离你大脑里
is isolating the part of your brain

118
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,470
负责存储记忆的部分  然后用激光切掉它
where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.

119
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,690
嗯  不行
Hmm, no.

120
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,760
你一不留神
One slip of the hand,

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,890
我就只能坐在工程学院里
and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department,

122
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,500
和沃罗威茨一起捣鼓些小玩意儿了
building doodads with Wolowitz.

123
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,610
好吧
All right.

124
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,020
你有没有考虑过提高你的社交技能呢
Have you considered improving your socialization skills,

125
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,680
好让你
thus allowing you

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,880
更有效地和别人交流
to communicate more effectively with other people?

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,260
这难道不是他们的负担吗
Isn't that their burden?

128
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,780
我一直都是瞩目的焦点
I'm the one with something interesting to say.

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,620
没错  但是从本质上来讲
Fair enough, but in its essence,

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,400
教书是一门表演艺术
teaching is a performance art.

131
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,780
在教室这一范例中
In the classroom paradigm,

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,130
教师有交流的责任
the teacher has the responsibility to communicate,

133
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,030
也有娱乐和吸引学生的责任
as well as entertain and engage.

134
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,630
我感觉你在循循善诱啊
I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

135
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,960
你为何不直奔主题呢
Would you mind very much jumping to it?

136
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,590
也许你该考虑一下学学表演
Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.

137
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,440
学表演
Acting lessons.

138
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,320
有意思
Interesting.

139
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,540
如果我能表现得好像我关心我的学生们
It might help if I could act as though I care

140
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,440
在意他们学没学会  没准儿还有点儿用
about my students and whether or not they learn.

141
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,650
佩妮
Penny.

142
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,380
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny.

143
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,980
干嘛
What?

144
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,790
你是个"演员"  对吧
You're an "actress," correct?

145
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,170
我不是"演员"
I'm not an "actress."

146
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,990
我就是演员
I'm an actress.

147
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,080
好吧
All right.

148
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,030
你是个演员
You're an actress.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,100
我需要你教教我
I need you to teach me.

150
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,400
你想上一节表演课
You want an acting lesson?

151
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,550
没准儿得两节  我想学精一点儿
Perhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,890
你怎么忽然想到这个的
Okay, where is this coming from?

153
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,050
有人建议我说  表演技巧
It has been suggested to me that acting techniques

154
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,170
能够提高我的教学水平
could improve my lecturing, at which,

155
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,530
如果有人相信那些微博和博客的话
if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed,

156
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,030
我貌似"不很擅长教学"
I "suck the big one."

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,200
啊  我都看过了  写得很好玩
Yeah, I saw those. They were funny.

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,750
我还打印了一些出来  贴在冰箱上了
I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.

159
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,280
那咱们什么时候开始上课
So, when could we start?

160
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
好吧  先把话说清楚了
Okay, just to be clear.

161
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,350
你找我帮忙是因为我会一些
You are asking me for help because I know something

162
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,440
你这位聪慧的谢尔顿·库珀博士不会的东西
that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

163
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,740
你这样解释也行
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

164
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,840
我认为这是唯一的解释了
I think it's the only way to look at it.

165
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,590
你到底帮不帮我嘛
Are you going to help me or not?

166
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,880
考虑看看  我只是比较享受这段前戏
Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay.

167
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,770
这是不是就意味着你不会再嘲笑我的演艺事业了
Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?

168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,370
真不好意思  我以为你由演员
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition

169
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,290
转变为表演课老师
from actor to acting teacher

170
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,710
就已经意味着
was the signal that one's career

171
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,950
你的事业走到了尽头了
had reached the end of the road.

172
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,580
算了吧
Forget it.

173
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,460
我付你四十美金
I'll pay you $40.

174
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,060
周六早上九点  带现金来
Saturday, 9:00 a.m. Bring cash.

175
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,210
拉杰  我有好消息要宣布
Raj, I have amazing news!

176
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,010
什么好消息
What?

177
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,290
以色列的魏茨曼研究所刚刚通知我
I just got offered a fellowship

178
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,460
他们给我提供了学术奖学金邀我过去
at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.

179
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,300
-伙计  这太棒了  -就是
- Dude, that's incredible!  - I know.

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,390
唯一的问题是  我得离开两年
The only thing is, I'm gonna be gone for two years.

181
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,190
我会想你的
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

182
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,170
你跟他一起去吗
Are you going with him?

183
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,780
我得留在这上学
I have to stay here for school.

184
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,920
我们就是来找你谈这件事的
That's what we're here to talk to you about.

185
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,350
你知道  伯纳黛特也是有需求的
You see, Bernadette has needs.

186
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,810
什么需求
What kind of needs?

187
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,630
性需求
Sexual needs.

188
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,820
大部分都还比较正常
Most of them regular,

189
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,270
但也有些比较狂野的
some of them kind of messed up.

190
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,990
所以  我不在的时候
So, while I'm gone,

191
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,920
就得靠你来满足她了
you're going to have to satisfy her.

192
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,570
你同意吗
What do you say?

193
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,780
乐意之至
I say okey-dokey.

194
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,660
你这么认真地想什么呢
What ya thinking so hard about?

195
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,590
我只是在想我绝对不是同性恋
Just that I'm definitely not gay.

196
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,590
佩妮
Penny!

197
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,790
佩妮  佩妮
Penny! Penny!

198
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,380
出什么事了
What's wrong?

199
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,550
没事  我在演戏而已
Nothing. I was acting.

200
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,710
你在演戏
You were acting.

201
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,120
没错  我为了今天要上的课做了很多预习
Yes. In preparation for today's studies,

202
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,620
我读了斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的《演员的准备》
I read Stanislavski's <i>An Actor Prepares,</i>
俄国演员  导演  戏剧教育家  理论家

203
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,520
斯特拉·阿德勒的《演戏的技术》
Stella Adler's <i>The Technique of Acting,</i>

204
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,270
犹他·哈根的《尊重表演艺术》
Uta Hagen's <i>Respect for Acting,</i>

205
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,460
和亨利·温克勒的《欸, 我是演员》
and Henry Winkler's <i>Ayyy, I'm an Actor.</i>

206
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
真不错
Well, good for you.

207
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,820
进来吧
Come on in.

208
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,670
我们怎么开始
How shall we begin?

209
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,060
我认为我们可以
Well, I thought we'd start

210
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,580
先做一些基础的动作练习
with some basic movement exercises.

211
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,450
就是稍微热热身
You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.

212
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,310
好吧
All right.

213
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,600
我想让你放松
So I just want you to relax

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
随意的扭动一下身体
and kind of move around in the space.

215
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,830
你觉得怎么自然就怎么来
You know, just do whatever feels natural.

216
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,430
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

217
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,280
你说让我觉得怎么自然就怎么来
You said to do whatever feels natural.

218
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,140
我这样就挺自然的
This feels natural.

219
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,600
肯定比你在做的那些动作
Certainly more natural

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,010
要自然得多
than what you're doing.

221
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,770
拜托  你得配合我
Come on, you got to work with me.

222
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,910
我们要跟我们的身体建立联系
We need to get connected with our bodies.

223
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,490
佩妮  我和我的身体
Penny, my body and I have a relationship

224
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,700
在双方都很酷并且保持一定距离的情况下
that works best when we maintain a cool,

225
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,920
才能运作的最好
wary distance from each other.

226
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,140
好吧  就当咱们已经热过身了吧
All right, let's just say we've warmed up.

227
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,660
你是"老师"  你说了算
You're the "teacher" .

228
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,710
好吧  你要是想跟你的学生
Okay. One of the things that might help you

229
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,100
建立沟通  其中一个有效的办法
in connecting with your students

230
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,360
就是要自然一些
is being a little more spontaneous.

231
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,110
所以咱们试试即兴表演怎么样
So why don't we try some improvisation?

232
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,250
当然好啦  反正
Why not? It seems like

233
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,780
你整个教学过程也都是在即兴表演
you're improvising your entire curriculum.

234
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,700
这主要练习的就是倾听和反应能力
This is all about listening and responding.

235
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,360
明白
Gotcha.

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,470
我要创造一个角色
I'm going to create a character

237
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,580
和一个场景  你准备好了就加入我的表演
and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.

238
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,060
-好的  -那开始了
- All right.  - All right.

239
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,570
开拍
Action.

240
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,820
好吧  这不是在演电影
Okay, it's not a movie.

241
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,910
这只是即兴表演  所以用不着叫"开拍"
It's improv. So no one calls "action" .

242
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,010
你还真教了我点东西呢
Hey, you taught me something.

243
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,620
谁能想到会有这么一天
Who would have thought it?

244
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,260
好吧
Okay.

245
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,760
不  货还没送到呢
Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived,

246
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,950
我真的很急着要那批鞋子
and I really need those shoes.

247
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,350
那可是我卖的最好的货
They are my biggest seller.

248
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,510
没错  六到十码的女鞋
Yes, ladies sizes six through ten.

249
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,540
谢谢  抱歉
Thank you. Oh, sorry.

250
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,670
我得挂了  有客人上门了  再见
I have to go. I have a customer. Bye-bye.

251
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,810
有什么可以帮到你的吗
Hi. Can I help you?

252
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,490
请给我来一杯冻酸奶  谢谢
I'd like a frozen yogurt, please.

253
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,930
酸奶
Yogurt?

254
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,290
好吧  没问题
Okay, sure.

255
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,220
还好我们又卖鞋又卖酸奶
Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.

256
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,180
是吗
You do?

257
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,070
是啊  你抬头看看我们的招牌
Yes. Look up at the sign,

258
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,650
你还要记着  即兴表演就是要说是
and remember, improv is always about saying yes.

259
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,300
好吧
All right.

260
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,480
是耶
Yes.

261
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,340
我看到招牌了
I see a sign.

262
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,510
上面写着"卡马里奥州精神病院"
It says "Camarillo State Mental Hospital" .

263
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,220
什么
What?

264
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,340
只有这个理由才能解释
It's the only explanation I can come up with

265
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,700
你怎么会认为自己又卖鞋又卖酸奶
for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.

266
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,520
好吧  这样好了
Okay, you know what?

267
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,930
咱们换个即兴表演的主题
Let's just try a different improv. Uh..

268
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,200
这次咱俩演两个
Oh, this time we will be two winos

269
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
住在高速公路天桥下的酒鬼好了
living under a freeway overpass.

270
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,500
我们都可以用道具了
Oh, and we're going to use props?

271
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,040
必须的
You bet.

272
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,060
我也是有梦想的  知道吗
I had dreams, you know.

273
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,550
我想出名
I was gonna be famous.

274
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,200
让我家乡的人都看看  我也能出人头地
Show everybody back home I could be someone.

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,640
可你看看我现在这样
Now look at me.

276
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,580
喝点吗
Want some?

277
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,810
你有冻酸奶吗
You have any frozen yogurt?

278
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,630
我还是不明白
I'm still not adjusted

279
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,610
幻想频道怎么会是这样拼写
to how the SyFy channel spells their name now.
原名Sci Fi 频道  专门播放科幻  奇幻  惊悚  超自然等电视影集

280
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,140
S-y-F-y  那就成"饭想"了
S-y-F-y. That's "siffy" .

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,330
喂
Hello?

282
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,500
天啊  他没事吧
Oh, my God! Is he okay?

283
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,510
-出什么事了  -等一下  等一下
- What happened?  - Hang on. Hang on.

284
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,910
好的  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

285
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,110
霍华德骑摩托车的时候被一辆卡车给撞了
Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck.

286
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,110
他现在情况危殆
He's in critical condition.

287
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,990
不
Oh, no!

288
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,630
你们听说了吗
Did you hear?

289
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,180
太可怕了
Isn't it terrible?

290
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,190
你见到他了吗
Have you seen him?

291
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,980
他们不让我进去
They wouldn't let me in.

292
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,540
我的霍霍呀
Oh, my Howie.

293
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,390
不会有事的  不会有事的
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

294
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,820
不会有事的
It'll be okay.

295
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,710
不会有事的
It'll be okay.

296
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,330
是霍华德
It's Howard.

297
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,050
喂  霍华德
Howard, hello.

298
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,100
拉杰  是你吗
Raj, is that you?

299
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,110
是的  我就在这  兄弟  你还好吗
Yeah, I'm right here, buddy. How are you?

300
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,840
听我说
Shh, shh. Listen to me.

301
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
我撑不过了
I'm not gonna make it.

302
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,490
不  不  不  别这么说
No, no, no, don't say that.

303
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,960
你会没事的
You're going to be all right.

304
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,360
拉杰  我时间不多了  好好听我说
Raj, I don't have time. Now, pay attention.

305
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,370
我最后的愿望就是你要好好照顾伯纳黛特
My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.

306
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,780
当然了  当然了
Of course, of course.

307
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,130
不过你说"照顾"是指
Now when you say "look after", you mean...

308
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,050
性方面的
Sexually.

309
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,900
对不起  伯纳黛特  我得听他亲口说出来
Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.

310
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,020
性需求
Sexually.

311
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,320
哦了  保重啦
Got it. Take care.

312
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,950
我别无选择
I guess I have no choice

313
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,750
只能在余生  一而再再而三
but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you

314
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,000
毫无罪恶地跟你享受甜蜜爱欲
over and over again for the rest of my life.

315
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,820
这也是我亲耳所闻的
That's how I heard it.

316
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,280
又或者可以取名为"幻仙"
Or it could be "sy-fee."

317
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,690
你说什么
What?

318
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,440
S-y-F-y. "幻仙"
S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

319
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,060
好吧
Oh, right.

320
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,590
给力
Good one.

321
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,450
对了  你有时间看一遍我给你的那部电影吗
So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?

322
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,890
看了  但是我不喜欢
Yes. I didn't care for it.

323
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,440
《朱门巧妇》可是美国经典中的经典
Okay, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> is an American classic.
《朱门巧妇》曾获5项奥斯卡提名

324
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
传奇汉堡也是
So is the McRib sandwich.

325
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,500
可我照样也不喜欢它
I don't care for that, either.

326
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,510
好吧  那在场景学习方面  你到底想怎么做
Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?

327
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,970
很高兴你能这么问
I'm glad you asked.

328
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,340
我擅自把我
I took the liberty

329
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,350
十岁那年写的《星际迷航》同人小说
of adapting a <i>Star Trek</i> fan fiction novella

330
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,020
改编成一部独幕剧
I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.

331
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,860
而你觉得比田纳西·威廉姆斯写的强多了
And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?
田纳西·威廉姆斯是《朱门巧妇》的作者

332
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,260
为什么不留给后代去决定呢
Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide?

333
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,940
《那些谢尔顿未曾到过的地方》
<i>Where No Sheldon</i> <i>Has Gone Before.</i>

334
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,970
这个故事是发生在东德克萨斯州
It's the story of a young boy who is transported

335
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,560
在愚昧无知的边远地区  一个少年郎
from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas

336
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,130
被送到二十三世纪
to the 23rd Century,

337
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,730
在那里  他的聪明才智不仅为人赏识  而且被人盛赞
where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.

338
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,610
杀了我吧
KMN...

339
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,530
现在  在这场关键的戏里
Now, in this pivotal scene,

340
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,180
你扮演的谢尔顿的母亲  与星际联邦的特使
Sheldon's mother, played by you, argues with an emissary

341
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,250
斯波克先生发生争吵  而斯波克先生
of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock,

342
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,480
则由我来生动的展现
the role I will bring to life.

343
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,750
好吧  这样也行  但咱们先试试
Okay, that's fine, but let's try

344
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,720
让你脱离你的舒适区
and get you out of your comfort zone.

345
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,400
为什么咱们要这么做
Why would we want to do that?

346
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,680
"舒适区"之所以这么叫  是有原因的
It's called "the comfort zone" for a reason.

347
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,670
这么做的原因是让你放松点儿
Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little,

348
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,080
所以我觉得你应该扮演母亲的角色
so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother,

349
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,430
而我负责来生动展现斯波克先生
and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.

350
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,350
我没听错吧
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,070
由你来演斯波克
You'll be Spock?

352
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,470
这才符合逻辑[Spock 台词]
It's only logical.

353
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,840
很好
Very well.

354
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,390
我来叙述一下背景
I'll set the scene.

355
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,650
好的
All right.

356
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,530
东德克萨斯州
"East Texas.

357
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,520
一个温暖的夏夜
"A warm summer night.

358
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,100
一个女人  玛丽
"A woman, Mary,

359
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
站在阳台上
"stands on a porch.

360
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,930
从远处传来  火车孤独的汽笛声
In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle..."

361
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,340
知了单调的嗡嗡声
"The droning buzz of cicadas..""

362
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,100
一只土狼冲着月亮嗷嚎
"A coyote howls at the moon,

363
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,120
吓唬着四面八方心灵脆弱的少年郎
frightening sensitive young boys everywhere."

364
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,880
在丛林之外
"Out in the woods,

365
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,390
-一只猫头鹰发出毛骨悚然的尖叫声  -够了够了
- an owl screeches..." - Okay, okay.

366
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,660
我懂了  你的背景叙述得很清楚了
We get it. You set the scene.

367
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,940
呜呼
Hoo!

368
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,700
快念你母亲角色的台词吧
Now just read your mother's line.

369
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,670
"谢利
"Shelly!

370
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,370
谢利  我跟你说过多少遍了
"Shelly, how many times have I told you

371
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,680
别把你的实验工具放在阳台"
"not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch?

372
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,540
"天啊
"Goodness,

373
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,010
我永远都不懂这孩子"
"I'll never understand that boy.

374
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,720
"不过再次声明  我是宗教迷
"But then again, I'm a religious nut,

375
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,510
我的心灵已经把太多东西拒之门外了"
and my mind is closed to so many things."

376
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,190
[模仿飞船飞过的飕飕震动声]

377
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,060
"斯波克呼叫进取号  发送成功"
"Spock to <i>Enterprise.</i> Transport successful."

378
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,320
"荣耀归于上天
"Glory be to Heaven,

379

某种不知名物体突然出现"
"some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air.

380
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,590
"乔治  把你那装满威士忌的百事可乐罐放下
"George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon

381
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,240
有时间做模作样  还不如赶紧把抢抗上呢"
that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!"

382
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,380
"向你问候  玛丽·库珀
"Greetings, Mary Cooper.

383
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,090
我是斯波克"
I am Spock."

384
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,430
抱歉  我还是接受不了
I'm sorry. I just don't buy it.

385
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,030
别停  继续演
Just keep going!

386
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,940
"天啊  你的突然出现吓坏我了"
"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."

387
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,910
"我们在遥远的二十三世纪里
"We have been monitoring your son Sheldon

388

一直密切关注着你的儿子  谢尔顿"

加入我们的行列"
"to join us.

"我懂"
"I understand.

"谢利
"Oh, Shelly?

有个男人说要把你带去未来

收拾的时候  记得带上干净的内裤哦"
Be sure to pack clean underwear."

397
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,110
好  很好  咱们再试试最后那段台词
Okay, okay, let's try that last line again,

398
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,800
这次你可以试着稍微带点哽咽
and this time, maybe try choking up a little.

399
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,650
为毛
Why?

400
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,300
你都快失去自己儿子了
Well, you're losing your son.

401
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,800
没错  但是他将要去一个更好的地方
Yes, but he's going to a better place

402
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,570
在那里他不会被人打击得  那么厉害
where he won't get beat up... so much.

403
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,170
拜托啦  试着按我说的演一把
All right, come on, just try it my way.

404
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,940
假装你很舍不得他走
Pretend you're sad to see him go.

405
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,150
我会带你入戏的
I'm gonna lead you in.

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,150
-该你了  -抱歉  即使你演技浮夸了点
- That's your cue. - I'm sorry. I just love that line.

409
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,110
但我依然爱这句台词爱到死
