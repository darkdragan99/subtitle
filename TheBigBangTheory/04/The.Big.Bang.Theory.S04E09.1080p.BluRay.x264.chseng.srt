1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,170
你知道漫画英雄世界里谁最有种吗
You know who's gonna be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,700
能给女浩克做比基尼蜜蜡除毛的最有种
Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
超英雄  绿巨人的表妹

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,090
要说有种嘛
You want to talk brave,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,720
美国队长那位从墨西哥偷渡过来的园丁怎么样
how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?
超级英雄  被视为美国精神的象征

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,430
他比不上那个每次办完事后都上厕所的哥们
He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,460
果不其然  你们又错了
As usual, you're all wrong.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
漫画英雄世界里最有种的人
The bravest person in the Marvel Universe

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,050
是那位给金刚狼做前列腺检查的医生
is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,570
那被金刚狼做前列腺检查的哥们儿呢
How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,340
你这是抬杠吧
Now you're just being silly.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
金刚狼可从来没表示过
Wolverine's never displayed

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,830
对帮助他人预防前列腺癌的
the slightest interest in helping others

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,820
有一点点兴趣
prevent prostate cancer.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,160
喂
Hello.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,350
对  电梯坏掉了
Yes, the elevator's out of order;

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,520
你得爬楼梯了
you'll have to use the stairs.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,800
你当然可以
Of course you can.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
披萨的历史可以追溯到16世纪
Pizza dates back to the 16th century,

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,470
可世界上第一部电梯1852年才面世
while the first elevator was not installed until 1852.

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,040
也就是说在三百多年的时间里
That means that for over 300 years,

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,730
人们都是爬楼梯送披萨的
people carried pizzas up stairs.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,030
请继承这一光荣传统吧
Be part of that proud tradition.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,560
趁他往披萨上吐口水的功夫  我去叫佩妮过来
I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,110
你觉得金刚狼是不是有个金刚不坏前列腺呢
Do you think they gave Wolverine an adamantium prostate?

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,940
这问题真傻逼
That's a stupid question.

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,600
我们不是在讨论如何检查超级英雄的菊花吗
We're having a conversation about probing the heinie of superheroes.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,850
这有什么傻逼的
There are no stupid questions.

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,980
找谁啊
Yes?

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,860
哦  佩妮在吗
Oh, um, is Penny here?

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,920
你就是莱纳德  对吗
You're Leonard, right?

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,620
对啊
Yeah.

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,970
妈的  终于见到你了  小子
Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,900
有谁能给我补充点背景知识吗
Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.

34
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,760
嗨  莱纳德  你见过我爸爸了
Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,310
哇  好了
Oh, good.

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,660
背景清楚了
Context.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,630
进来吧  伙计
Come on in, buddy.

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,380
进来坐会儿
Take a load off.

39
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,860
老爸  莱纳德没时间
Oh, gee, Dad, Leonard can't stay.

40
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,260
他只是顺道来打招呼的
He just dropped by to say hello.

41
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,490
谢谢你过来  亲爱的
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

42
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,690
咱俩回聊
I'll see you later.

43
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,930
拜
Bye.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,020
真诡异
That was odd.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,320
生活大爆炸第四季第九集

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,220
你确定这点儿漫画书就够了吗
Are you sure you have enough comics?

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,720
到时候你可得守12个小时的望远镜
You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours,

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,470
而据我估算你挑的这些书
and by my estimate, you've only selected

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,700
只够看7个小时的
seven hours of reading material.

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
我还算上了
That's even factoring in

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,970
你纠结美国漫画书里这些俚语的时间
your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,050
比如"嘭"  "唰"
like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,410
他这算种族歧视吗
Is that racist?

54
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,910
我觉得挺像的
It feels racist.

55
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,450
别太敏感了
Don't be oversensitive.

56
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,340
他是说你文盲  又不是说印度人都文盲
He's calling you illiterate, not your race.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
哦  那就好
Oh, okay. Good.

58
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,270
我不用再挑漫画书了
I don't need more comics.

59
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
霍华德到时候会过来  我们会一起玩
Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play

60
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,410
星际战舰和印度大富翁
Intergalactic Battleship and Indian Monopoly.

61
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,280
我可不喜欢大富翁的新版本
I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly.

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,210
我更喜欢经典的  普通版的和克林贡版的
I prefer the classics: regular and Klingon.

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,140
其实印度大富翁
Actually, Indian Monopoly's

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,410
和普通版差不多  只是钱变成了卢比
just like regular, except the money's in rupees,

65
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,670
酒店变成了呼叫中心而已
instead of hotels you build call centers,

66
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,930
如果你抽机会卡  有可能死于痢疾
and when you pick a Chance card, you might die of dysentery.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,830
顺便告诉你
Just FYI,

68
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,640
这才叫种族歧视
that was racist.

69
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,980
你们肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
You'll never guess what just happened.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,350
你走在去门厅的路上
You went out in the hallway,

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,200
一不小心跌进了异次元空间之门
stumbled into an interdimensional portal

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
来到了5000年后的未来
which brought you 5,000 years into the future,

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
然后你在那里利用当时的先进技术
where you took advantage of the advanced technology

74
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,610
造了一架时间机器  现在你是回来
to build a time machine, and now you're back

75
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,960
接我们去7010年
to bring us all with you to the year 7010

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,290
那时候我们就能被派到飞海豚利用通灵术
where we are transported to work at the Thinkatorium

77
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,410
控制的思维水族馆工作了
by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?

78
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,430
错
No.

79
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
佩妮刚才吻了我
Penny kissed me.

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,490
这怎么猜得出来
Well, who would ever guess that?

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,620
是  是哪种吻啊
What-what kind of a kiss?

82
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,730
长吻啊  嘴对嘴的
A big kiss. On the mouth.

83
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,020
会不会是她本来想吻你的脸的
Is it possible that she was going for your cheek

84
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,880
结果你的脸一偏她就亲到嘴唇了
and you moved and she accidentally got lip?

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,590
我跟我妈经常这样
That happens with me and my mom all the time.

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,770
她跟她老爸介绍了我
She introduced me to her father,

87
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,000
吻完我以后就当我面把门关了
kissed me and then shut the door in my face.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,990
也许这是暗示
Maybe she was trying to send you a message.

89
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,670
真的吗
You think?

90
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,060
是啊  暗示"这个男的不是我爸爸
Yeah. "This man is not my father.

91
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,350
我被挟持了
I'm being held hostage.

92
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,100
所以我要做一些
So I'm going to do

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,210
疯狂之举好暗示你
something insane in the hopes

94
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,990
去报警"
that you'll call 911."

95
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,530
佩妮吻我可不是什么疯狂之举
Penny kissing me is not insane.

96
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,020
她以前经常吻我的
She used to kiss me all the time.

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,890
爱因斯坦对精神病的定义是  "翻来覆去地
Einstein defined insanity as "Doing the same thing

98
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,230
重复一件事并期冀得到不同的结果"
over and over again and expecting different results."

99
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,840
根据这个标准
By that standard,

100
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,320
佩妮病得不轻
Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

101
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,720
我只是觉得
I'm just saying,

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,780
那个吻有些意味深长
it felt like it may have meant something.

103
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,460
这话让我想起从前了
Ah, this takes me back.

104
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,470
那时候佩妮让莱纳德如此着迷
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

105
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,540
别误会  我挺喜欢你现在的状态
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff,

106
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,430
但偶尔听听你的痴情独白还是蛮有意思的
but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.

107
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,970
你再说一遍"我们的孩子会才貌双全"
Do "Our babies will be smart and beautiful."

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,680
每次想起这句话我就笑得不行
That one always makes me laugh.

109
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,600
我真是吃饱了撑着跟你们聊天
Why do I bother talking to you people?

110
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
我想说其实我们根本没在听  可能你会感觉好点
If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
能出来说句话吗
Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?

112
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,010
当然
Yeah, sure.

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,500
我有预感那个披萨永远也不会送来了
I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.

114
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,070
你可能在琢磨刚才是怎么回事
So you're probably wondering what that was all about.

115
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,940
什么  你指你吻我那件事吗
What, uh, the kissing and everything?

116
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,710
没什么  经常有女人对我这样的啦
Nah, women do that to me all the time.

117
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,380
好吧  实际上  我貌似
Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of

118
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,540
跟我爸说我们又在一起了
told my father we got back together again.

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,970
什么  为什么
What? Why?

120
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,060
你是至今以来
Well, you're the first guy

121
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,690
第一个被他认可的人  知道吗
he's ever really approved of, you know?

122
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,750
你是个上过大学的科学家
You're a scientist who went to college

123
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,030
你脖子上没有纹身
and you don't have a neck tattoo

124
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,640
不是通缉犯  也没孩子
or outstanding warrants or...or a baby.

125
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,150
你以前都跟什么人在一起啊
What kind of guys did you used to go out with?

126
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,460
就是一般人呗
Just guys.

127
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,710
总之  他知道我们分手了以后伤心的要命
Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken,

128
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,430
他总是问我  莱纳德好吗
and he kept bugging me,"How's Leonard?

129
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,010
你为什么就不能跟莱纳德和好呢
Why can't you get back together with Leonard?

130
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,900
我敢说莱纳德从来不会惹祸上身
I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself."
tip a cow翻牛运动  美国农村的愚蠢运动

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
所以为了让他不再烦我
So to get him off my back,

132
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,910
我就跟他说咱俩和好了
I told him we worked things out.

133
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,470
是吗
Really?

134
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,110
咱俩是怎么和好的
How-how'd we manage that?

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,670
什么
What?

136
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,050
你道歉了吗
I mean, did you apologize?

137
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,130
还是你跑来追我了
Did you have to woo me?

138
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,490
少做白日梦了
Get over yourself.

139
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,460
我一个口哨  你就冲过来了
I whistled, you came running.

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
是吗  我可不这么认为
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,450
好吧  你干吗要跟我争这个
Okay, why are you arguing about this?

142
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,160
我只是想说
I'm just saying,

143
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,230
如果我们假装和好
if we fake got back together,

144
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,940
那也肯定不是这么和好的
that's totally not how it fake happened.

145
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,070
好吧  随便啦
Okay, whatever.

146
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,980
你能不能就跟我装到我爸离开为止
Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?

147
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,400
等一下  你真的想让我
Hold on, you actually want me

148
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,510
用我的演技和吻功
to deceive your father with some sort of

149
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,280
来瞒过你老爸吗
sham playacting and kissing?

150
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
我可是这方面的高手
'Cause I'm good with that.

151
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,100
佩妮  你在外面吗
Penny, you out here?

152
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,070
拜托  亲爱的  别当着我老爸这样啊
Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.

153
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,690
别担心  我看过你跟烂得多的人
Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse

154
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,430
干过严重得多的事呢
with a lot stupider.

155
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,840
看吧  他不介意
See? He doesn't mind.

156
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,150
莱纳德  我准备带你的女朋友
So, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out

157
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,510
去吃牛排  你要一起来吗
for a steak dinner; you want to join us?

158
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,840
爸  你真好人  但是莱纳德还要工作呢
Oh, Dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work.

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,580
对吧  莱纳德
Right, Leonard?

160
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,240
没错  我要工作
Uh, I do, I have to work.

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,930
但我决定丢下工作来陪我的宝贝儿
But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening

162
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,410
和她的父亲  因为
with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know,

163
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,590
我就是这种体贴的男朋友
just the kind of boyfriend I am.

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
过来吧宝贝儿
Come here, you.

165
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,780
C-7
C-7.

166
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,540
错了
Miss.

167
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,400
怎么会错呢
How could that be a miss?

168
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
C-6中了  C-8也中了
C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

169
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,640
你的飞船肯定有一部分是在C-7上的
Part of your starship has to be on C-7.

170
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,890
除非飞船上有个洞
Not if it has a hole in the middle.

171
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,900
什么飞船上会有洞呀
What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?

172
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,230
罗慕伦战斗百吉饼
A Romulan Battle Bagel?

173
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,630
敲敲
Knock-knock.

174
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,900
太好了  你来了
Oh, great, you made it.

175
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,110
快进来
Come on in.

176
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,680
是我请她来的
I invited her.

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
望远镜在哪
So where's the telescope?

178
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,870
在夏威夷  但是拉杰可以在这里控制
It's in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here.

179
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
他想观测波江座ε星云  从而证明
He's hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be

180
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,220
有行星围绕它的轨道运行
evidence of a planet orbiting it.

181
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,960
所以我们就坐在这盯着屏幕
So we just sit and stare at the screen,

182
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,080
然后干等吗
waiting for something to happen?

183
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,610
咱俩租《恋恋笔记本》看的时候不就这样吗
I did it with you when we rented the Note Book.

184
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,560
没错  吉娜·罗兰兹是很漂亮
Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.

185
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,730
你最好把那瓶酒开了
You'd better open up that bottle of wine

186
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,880
不然我的耳朵里就全是他的口水了
or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.

187
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,710
不好意思
Excuse me.

188
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,200
我不能喝酒  我就要完成
I can't be drinking, I'm about to make

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,040
一个重大的科学发现了
an important scientific discovery here.

190
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,580
什么  伽利略的伟绩都是喝着酒完成的
What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.

191
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,600
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

192
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,050
他是意大利人
Well, he was Italian.

193
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,860
意大利人不都这样吗
It's a reasonable assumption.

194
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,900
伙计  你是不是一张嘴
Dude, can you even open your mouth

195
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,710
就要一棒子打死一个民族呀
without spewing a cultural stereotype?

196
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,180
好吧  对不起  伽利略喝健怡雪碧
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Galileo drank Diet Sprite.

197
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,400
你是我的死党  她是我女朋友
Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend;

198
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,590
你们应该培养感情
you should bond.

199
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,590
就像你跟我妈那样
You know, like you and my mom did.

200
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,250
你妈吓死我了
Your mom creeps the hell out of me.

201
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,620
是  但她不再叫你贫民窟的百万富翁了
Yes, but she's stopped calling you Slumdog Millionaire.

202
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,030
这点我的确很感激她
I do appreciate that.

203
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,400
酒来了
Here we go.

204
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,620
我想敬个酒
I'd like to propose a toast.

205
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,140
敬科学和友谊
To science and friendship.

206
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,310
等等  等一下
Hold on. Wait.

207
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,240
不  没事了  喝吧
No, it's okay, go ahead.

208
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,950
怎么了
What?

209
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,930
我今天在实验室里
Oh, I was working with

210
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,030
研究抗青霉素的淋病
penicillin-resistant gonorrhea in the lab today

211
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,120
所以我刚才在回忆我有没有洗手
and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.

212
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,740
谢谢你请我吃牛排  怀特
Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

213
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,990
不用客气
My pleasure.

214
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,520
能跟佩妮找的会用餐巾的男朋友
It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's

215
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,530
一起吃饭是件好事
that knows how to use a napkin.

216
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,260
不好笑  老爸
So not funny, Dad.

217
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,620
我跟你介绍一下她之前的男朋友
Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with,

218
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,050
那个叫多尼的家伙吧
this-this fella Donnie.

219
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,460
你别再提了行不行
Oh, will you please let it go?

220
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,630
多尼准备把农场废物
Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste

221
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,220
转变成生物燃料然后买给政府
into biofuel and selling it to the government.

222
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,460
很多人在干这行
A lot of people are doing that.

223
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,360
听到没
Oh, see?

224
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,220
但是多尼只是把猪粪混了点水
Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water

225
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,440
然后就灌进他妈的凯美瑞里
and pump it into his mom's Camry.

226
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,750
真不错
Yeah, that's great.

227
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,430
故事真好笑  说别的吧
It's a funny story. Moving on.

228
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,020
要是跟那个想把乒乓球啤酒游戏列入
And Donnie was a rocket scientist

229
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,680
奥林匹克项目的家伙比的话
compared to that boy

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,780
多尼也算是个火箭科学家了
who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics.

231
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,120
他叫什么名字啊  宝贝儿
What was his name, sweetheart?

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,510
柯蒂斯  我肯定他在说笑
Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.

233
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,340
我也不知道
I don't know.

234
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,260
他还递了申请呢  我看他挺认真的
That petition looked real to me.

235
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,450
好吧  同志们该刹车了
Yeah, okay, I think this ends

236
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,770
今晚别再提起我前男友了
the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,600
我只是很高兴你终于找到了一位护花使者
Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.

238
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,090
谢谢  怀特
Thanks, Wyatt.

239
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,720
我是护花使者哟
I'm a keeper.

240
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,540
莱纳德  来吃个宵夜吧
Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?

241
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,600
天  老爸  他也很想
Oh, gee, Dad, he'd love to,

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
但莱纳德明天一早要工作
but Leonard has to work in the morning.

243
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,270
也许我能晚点去
Maybe I could go in a little late.

244
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,660
不不不  不行
No, no, no, you can't.

245
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,070
你的工作相当重要
Your career is far too important.

246
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,900
每个成功的男人背后  都有个唠叨的女人
Behind every great man is a nagging woman

247
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,490
让他没法享乐子  是吧  莱纳德
who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?

248
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,420
可不是嘛
Don't I know it.

249
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,060
晚安  孩子
Well, good night, son.

250
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,240
晚安  怀特
Good night, Wyatt.

251
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,710
晚安  亲爱的
Oh, good night, honey.

252
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,170
晚安
Good night.

253
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
我爱你
I love you.

254
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,210
我也爱你
Love you, too.

255
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
搞什么  又当众闪光[Frak出自《BSG》科幻版Fuck]
Oh, friggety-frak.

256
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,630
有完没完
Not this again.

257
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,140
3  4  6  过  得到两千卢比[印度货币]
Three, four, five-- pass go, get 2,000 rupees--

258
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,200
6  7
six, seven.

259
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,410
哎呀  不能走了  一头圣牛挡住了我去路
Whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.

260
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,360
伯纳黛特  你能不能告诉你男友
Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend

261
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,780
别再纠结印度圣牛的笑话了
to cool it with the cow jokes.

262
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,670
没用的
It won't help.

263
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,310
他要是找到一个笑话  就会一直讲个不停
Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.

264
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,190
没错
Yeah.

265
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,770
就比如他理发那次
Like his haircut material.

266
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,680
是啊  你理过发了吗
Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?

267
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,800
"不  我全部理光了"
"No. I got them all cut."

268
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,500
现在还是真好笑呀
Which is still so funny.

269
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,800
你去到一家中餐馆
And when you go to a Chinese restaurant,

270
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,330
他每次都在幸运饼里拿到同一张纸条
he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.

271
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,070
没错  "救命  我是个囚犯"
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

272
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,520
"被关在中国幸运饼工厂里"
in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."

273
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,190
好吧  你们侃我侃够了吧
Okay, I think that's enough about me.

274
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,890
没错  我们开始侃他老妈
He's right. Let's make fun of his mother.

275
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,450
霍华德  快来帮我搓脚
"Howard, come rub my feet!

276
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,620
我脚上的鸡眼痛死了
My corns are killing me!"

277
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,850
霍华德  快把我从浴缸里拉起来
"Howard, help me out of the tub!

278
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,920
我又卡在里面了
I'm stuck again!"

279
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,350
来了
Coming.

280
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,260
你好呀  小心肝
Hey, lovebug.

281
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,900
闭嘴
Shut up.

282
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,940
你知道前一个小时我都在做什么吗
You know what I've been doing for the last hour?

283
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,640
在本子上涂鸦心目中的
Mm, dreamily doodling "Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

284
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,270
"霍夫斯塔德太太"形象吗
in a notebook?

285
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,360
听我爸不停念叨
Listening to my father go on and on

286
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,980
你是个多么棒的人
about what a great guy you are.

287
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
你得承认  我的确很讨人喜欢
You got to admit, I am... I'm delightful.

288
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,970
你干嘛把事情搞这么复杂
Why are you making this so difficult?

289
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,080
哪里复杂了
It's not difficult for me.

290
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,880
我觉得很有趣
I'm having fun.

291
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,520
莱纳德
Leonard.

292
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,270
那你要我怎么样  是你挑起来的
What do you want me to do? You started this.

293
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,950
你想过去告诉他我们分手了吗
Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?

294
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,360
-不想  -那你想怎么样
- No. - Well, then, what do you want?

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
我不知道
I don't know.

296
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
难道你在跑过来之前
Don't you think that's something you should

297
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,430
不应该先想想清楚吗
have figured out before you stomped over here?

298
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,070
好吧  也许是
Maybe.

299
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,370
莱纳德  佩妮  刚好你们在
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

300
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,090
我想说我很高兴你们又在一起了
I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together,

301
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,080
如果我能有法子让自己显得更真诚些
and if I can figure out a way to do so

302
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,370
我肯定会不遗余力
and sound sincere, I will.

303
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,190
与此同时
In the meantime,

304
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,070
我要对室友协议进行一些修订
I'd like to go over some proposed changes

305
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,530
特别要提出关于佩妮
to the roommate agreement specifically to address

306
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,740
十分烦人的个人习惯
Penny's annoying personal habits.

307
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,200
我的老天
Oh, my God.

308
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,230
-什么个人习惯  -我列了个单子
- What personal habits? - I have a list.

309
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,630
顺便  第12条就是"我的天啊"的滥用
FYI, overuse of the phrase "Oh, my God" is number 12.

310
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
好吧  谢尔顿  你没必要这么做
Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this

311
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,430
-因为我和莱纳德不...  -吡吡吡吡吡
- because Leonard and I are not... Ba-ba-ba-ba.

312
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,290
你确定要把他也牵扯进来吗
Are you sure you want to include him in this?

313
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,870
牵扯进什么东西
Include me in what?

314
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,170
有什么正在策划中的阴谋?
Is there a plot afoot?

315
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,090
我可绝对不参与阴谋
I'll have no truck with plots.

316
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,110
好吧  你是对的
No, you're right.

317
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,220
不不  没有情节  不用卡车也不用走路
No, there's... there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

318
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,550
还有什么烦人的习惯要讨论
So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?

319
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,780
我们不是讨论
Uh, we don't discuss anything.

320
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,460
莱纳德签署了室友协议
Leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement.

321
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,170
所以  他对你的违规行为
As such, he bears responsibility

322
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,540
负有全责  并必须支付罚款
for all your infractions and must pay all fines.

323
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
-罚款  -是的
- Fines? - Yes.

324
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,810
如果佩妮又要继续在这过夜
If Penny's going to be spending nights here again,

325
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,470
你就得建立一个托管帐户
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

326
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,130
在这签名
Sign here.

327
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,490
你好丫  夏威夷
Hello, Hawaii.

328
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,240
我是帕萨迪纳市的库萨帕里博士
This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

329
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,260
你想请你改放望远镜的位置
I'd like you to reposition the telescope, please.

330
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,140
斯嘉丽·约翰逊的家[著名女演员  超靓]
Scarlett Johansson's house!

331
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,270
开玩笑的啦  夏威夷
I'm kidding, Hawaii.

332
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,830
多谢啦[夏威夷语]
Mahalo.

333
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,920
嗷呜
Whoo!

334
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,500
我们开第二瓶酒
It might have been a mistake

335
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,030
根本就是个错误
to open that second bottle of wine.

336
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,930
吃一堑长一智嘛
Well, live and learn.

337
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,620
拉杰  你觉得你找的那个星球上
So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for

338
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,140
拥有适合生命生存的环境吗
could have an atmosphere that supports life?

339
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,270
也许吧
Maybe.

340
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,280
如果真是  我就出名了
If it did, I'd be famous.

341
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
我会成为杂志封面人物
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

342
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
那我就不用孤独一人住小公寓了
And then, instead of living alone

343
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,130
而是能住大豪宅
in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

344
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,280
听起来真棒
That sounds great.

345
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,980
的确
It is.

346
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,700
如果你想一个人住空荡荡的房子
If you like wandering around a big, empty house

347
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,850
却没人爱着你
with no one to love you.

348
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,070
-我们会去看你  -不会的
- We'd come visit you. - No, you wouldn't.

349
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,020
你们会被我的财富和名声吓倒
You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame.

350
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
我的朋友只有我那转基因的猴子管家
My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler

351
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,850
还有我雇来的那侏儒真人象棋
and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.

352
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,550
他要开始变阴郁了吧
He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?

353
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,280
再看看  他说不定能恢复的
Hold on. He could come back.

354
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,970
哦  这一切到底有何意义
Oh, what's the point of everything?

355
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,790
没戏了  他彻底醉了
Nope. He's gone.

356
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,330
你知道  我已经超过一年
You know it's been more than a year

357
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,410
没吻过姑娘了
since I've even kissed a girl?

358
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,800
你跟我说的在动漫展搭上的那姑娘呢
What about that hookup at Comic-Con you told me about?

359
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,180
醒醒吧  我在骗人
Oh, grow up. I was lying.

360
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,750
我一直在骗人  没人愿意吻我
I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.

361
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,690
可怜的小东西
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

362
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,500
拉杰  你得知道你这人很棒
Raj, you have to know you're a wonderful man.

363
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,690
很多姑娘都会愿意吻你的
There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.

364
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,670
在哪呢
Where?

365
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,080
只要你努力找寻
You just have to look.

366
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,020
这下好玩了
Well, this was fun.

367
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,540
哦  有鱼咬钩了
Oh! I think I got a nibble.

368
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
小心点
Oh, be careful.

369
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,780
先放线
Give him some line.

370
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,940
好了  可以收线了
Okay, now reel him in.

371
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,410
看看这鱼
Oh, look at that baby.

372
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,820
咬得可真紧啊
They're really biting, huh?

373
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,530
对  你设定在"容易"时  鱼儿都这样
Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.

374
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
是我的
Oh, that's me.

375
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,500
是我  亲爱的
Oh, hi, sweetie.

376
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,240
对  我很早就起床了  不想吵醒你
Yeah, I got up early and didn't want to wake you,

377
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,300
所以出去买咖啡了  回来的时候碰到莱纳德
so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back.

378
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,750
你猜怎么着  我们现在在钓鱼
Guess what-- we're fishing.

379
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,150
对  就坐在他们沙发上钓着呢
Yeah. Right here on his couch.

380
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,690
宝贝  我爱你
Hey, baby. I love you!

381
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,230
是莱纳德
That's Leonard.

382
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,920
说他爱你
Says he loves you.

383
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,010
什么
What?

384
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
我明白了
I see.

385
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,840
这些都是瞎编的  是吗
The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

386
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,790
我真是失望  再见
Well, that's very disappointing. Bye.

387
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,900
我一直有话想跟你说
There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.

388
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,780
真不敢相信  你们会这么骗我
I can't believe you would lie to me like that.

389
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,560
声明一下  我也是身不由己的
Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.

390
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,340
我等下再找你算账
I'll get to you in a minute.

391
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,890
不急
No hurry.

392
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,060
我的亲生女儿  觉得我不够爱她到
That my own daughter thinks I don't love her enough

393
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,760
不管她怎么选择我都会支持她
to support her no matter what choices she makes--

394
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,030
这太伤我心了
well, that hurts me deeply.

395
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,650
-抱歉老爸...  -让我说完
- I'm sorry, Daddy... - Let me finish.

396
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,440
我还以为你已今非昔比了
I thought we were past the days

397
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,740
不会再蒙骗我了
when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes.

398
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,560
说你内衣抽屉里的小袋子是香包
Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri?

399
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,510
卫生间里的验尿棒是查糖尿病的
And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?

400
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,690
对不起
You know, I'm sorry.

401
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,360
你长大了  我尊重你
You're a grown woman, and I respect your right

402
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
让你自己作决定
to make your own decisions,

403
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,460
我只要求你也同样尊重我
but all I ask is you respect me enough

404
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,780
要对我说实话
to be honest about them.

405
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,440
你说得对  从今以后我一定对你说实话
You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.

406
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,050
谢谢  现在进去换件衣服
Thank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on

407
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,650
趁我出发去机场前  先去吃点东西
and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport.

408
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
-而你...  -老爸  他跟着没关系...
- Now you... - Daddy, he had nothing to do...

409
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,310
-走你的  -好吧
- Keep walking.  - Okay.

410
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,100
求求你  拜托你别放弃追她
Please, please, please don't give up on her.

411
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
什么
What?

412
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,720
我不想再面对什么滑板白痴  白人说唱歌手
I can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers

413
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,420
还有那些反戴帽子满身汗臭的蠢驴们
and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.

414
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,930
天  我不知道我是否还有机会
Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

415
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,160
那就作弊
Then, stack the deck.

416
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,250
欺骗  撒谎  我无所谓
Cheat. Lie. I don't care.

417
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,580
我死前还想抱上外孙
I want grandkids before I die,

418
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,590
而且不想他们在活动房里长大
and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.

419
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,750
-那我试试  -谢谢
- I'll give it a shot.  - Thank you.

420
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,200
现在我来做点事帮帮你
Now I'm going to do something here to help you along.

421
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
-什么  -别怕就对了
- Excuse me?  - Just don't panic.

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,750
你这个骗人的混蛋快给我滚蛋
Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face

423
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,020
别让我再看到你
and make sure I never see it again!

424
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,250
逆反心理  我懂的  真聪明
Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That's very clever.

425
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,600
别说出来  快出去
Don't yap. Just get out.

426
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,790
我回去上Facebook加你好友
I'll friend you on Facebook.

427
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,050
你来了
Oh, there you are.

428
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,040
跟你说  我一晚没睡
Just so you know, I was up all night,

429
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,610
终于完成了
but I have finally completed

430
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,190
针对佩妮部分的新室友协议
the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.

431
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,580
不必了  我们又分手了
Yeah well, not necessary. We broke up again.

432
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,230
你有没有为别人着想过  莱纳德
Do you even think about other people, Leonard?

433
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,610
你想过没有
Do you?

434
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,190
昨晚怎么样
Oh, how'd it go last night?

435
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,450
你知道的
Oh, you know.

436
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,250
都一样的  没啥变化
Same old, same old.

437
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,950
通过望远镜看到些星星  就是大惊喜了
Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.

438
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,650
真的吗
Really?

439
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,110
这望远镜你可等了几个月了  怎么了
You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?

440
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,860
干嘛  采访我写书吗
Why? You writing a book?

441
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,430
我提出个假设
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

442
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,940
昨晚  拉杰偶然与外星文明联络上了
Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization

443
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,740
然后被美国政府要求严格保密
and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.

444
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,020
啥事都没有  能换个话题吗
Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?

445
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,640
这话一听就是排演过的  我们不是唯一智慧生命
That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.

446
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,260
昨晚你顺利把玩上拉杰的大望远镜了吗
You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?

447
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,080
这话从何说起
Where did that come from?

448
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,560
他从未碰过我的望远镜
He never touched my telescope.

449
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,070
你给我闭嘴
Way to go shutting up.

450
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,420
我闭嘴了  你也给我闭嘴
I did shut up. Now you shut up.

451
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,200
-好吧  -谢谢
- Fine.  - Thank you.

452
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,020
真不敢相信  你今早没给我打电话
I can't believe you didn't call me this morning.
