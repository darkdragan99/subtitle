1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,890
说真的
No, seriously,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,170
我终于明白为何自己找不到女人了
I think I've finally figured out my problem with women.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,960
水豚是啮齿类动物中为数最多的品种
The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,300
这跟我与找女人有何关联
What does that have to do with me and women?

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,710
没关联  我只是迫切想为
Nothing. It was a desperate attempt

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,560
午餐会换个新话题罢了
to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,880
我的问题在于  我没有展现出自信
My problem is, I don't project confidence.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,500
所以我决定  当我下次见到美女时
So I decided the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,740
我不会退缩和矜持
rather than holding back and being cautious,

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,430
我要展现我自信的一面
I'm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,110
是吗  那该是什么样子的呢
Oh, yeah? What's that look like?

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,970
你好啊
Hi.

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,810
我叫莱纳德
I'm Leonard.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,370
你宛若天仙一般
And you are beautiful.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,030
青春  奔放  热力四射
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,710
我晚上8点钟去接你
I'm going to pick you up at 8:00,

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,500
定会带给你一个永生难忘的夜晚
show you a night you will never forget.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,560
我们今晚去哪儿呢
Where are we going?

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,600
好消息来了
Good news.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,470
我入选了国防部新组建的
I made it onto the team for the new Defense Department

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,410
激光监测卫星小组
laser-equipped surveillance satellite.

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,740
打断一下
Excuse me.

23
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,000
如果我们要转换话题  我的话题应该有优先权
If we're changing topics, I believe I have first dibs

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,010
水豚  一种体型与河马宝宝相仿的啮齿类动物
with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,830
恭喜你  霍华德
Congratulations, Howard.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,650
谢了
Thanks.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,000
听着  我必须得通过安全审核
Listen, I have to get a security clearance,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,760
所以联邦调查局的人可能会找你们问话
so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,320
我不想跟联邦调查局的人说话
I don't want to speak to the FBI.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,030
为什么
Why not?

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,780
我是棕色人种而且口音搞笑
I'm brown and I talk funny.

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,990
他们只是为了调查一下我的背景而已
They're just doing a background check on me.

33
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,480
这无关紧要  他们总会设法
It doesn't matter, they'll find a reason

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,420
把我遣返回甘地城的[印度]
to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,020
顺便说一下  话虽如此  但并无冒犯之意
By the way, when I say that, it's not offensive.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,350
别傻了  拉杰
Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,370
你是合法居留的
You're here legally.

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,040
没人会在乎这个  你知道我因为
Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,410
在机场安检时没出具
since I got through airport security

40
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,170
结肠镜检查报告而被困了多久吗
without being given a colonoscopy?

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
我一直很努力地
You know, I try very hard

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,880
想把我们的午餐时间变得更为科学有益
to make our lunch hours educational and informative,

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,820
但你们执着的讨论自己生活琐事的行为
but your insistence on talking about your own lives

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,200
每次都深深地阻挠了我
stymies me at every turn.

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,540
好吧  谢尔顿  跟我们谈你那个巨型啮齿类动物吧
Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
不了  你浪费了我们探讨的黄金时间
No, you squandered your time with me,

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
而那个时刻已经一去不复返了
and the moment has now passed.

48
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,330
尽情回味你们的失落吧
Feast on your disappointment,

49
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,460
就像水豚回味自己的排泄物一样
much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.

生活大爆炸第四季第七集

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,000
[暮色2:新月]

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,000
贝拉  你难道不明白吗
Oh, Bella, don't you see?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,130
爱德华离开你只是因为他爱你
Edward's only pushing you away because he loves you.

58
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,570
来了
Coming.

59
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,170
库萨帕里博士吗
Dr. Koothrappali?

60
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,300
我是联调局探员  蓓姬
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,850
我可以进来吗
May I come in?

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,960
我想跟你谈谈霍华德·沃罗威茨
I'd like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,620
哦  谢谢
Oh, thank you.

64
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,420
好吧  说说你认识沃罗威茨先生多久了
All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,330
朗姆酒蛋糕要吗
Rum cake?

66
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,570
不  谢了
No, thanks.

67
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,540
关于沃罗威茨先生...
Now, about Mr. Wolowitz...

68
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,970
认识7年了
Seven years.

69
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,450
了解了
I see.

70
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,810
我在这个国家是合法的  你懂的
I'm in this country legally, you know.

71
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,400
我也这么想
I'm sure you are.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,630
据你所知
Now, to your knowledge,

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,000
沃罗威茨先生曾经有过犯罪前科吗
has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,950
当然没有
Of course not.

75
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,530
我来这用的是H-1B签证
I'm here on an H-1B visa,
H-1B签证:外籍人士的短期非移民工作签证

76
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,550
这也意味着我不可能跟任何形式的
which means I can't be associated in any way

77
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,650
犯罪活动扯上关系而且我也没有过
with crime or criminal activity and I'm not.

78
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,080
很好
Good.

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,450
据你所知  沃罗威茨先生
To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz

80
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,990
有任何国外的联系人吗
have any foreign contacts?

81
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,940
没了  就只有我
No, just me.

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,070
天呐  终于来了
Oh, there it is.

83
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,720
开始掏家底了
Here comes a cavity search.

84
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,430
你说什么
Excuse me?

85
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,580
求你们别送我回印度去  那里太拥挤了
Please don't send me back to India, it's so crowded!

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,240
整个国家像一场无止境的动漫大会一样
It's like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con,

87
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,930
除了每个人穿着相同的装束
except everybody's wearing the same costume:

88
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,610
印度人装
Indian Guy.

89
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,810
-库萨帕里博士  我不是来...  -我爱这个国家
- Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not... - I love this country!

90
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,660
这里有棒球  自由
The-the baseball, the freedom,

91
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,770
和一大堆病态的肥胖人士
the rampant morbid obesity!

92
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,290
从加利福尼亚到纽约
From California to the New York Island!

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,700
我都算是"洋基歌"的忠实粉丝
I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!
洋基歌:独立战争时士兵的流行歌

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,740
库萨帕里博士  请你...
Dr. Koothrappali, please.

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,410
*我的国家充满了...*
My country 'tis of thee... ?
他唱的实际是"My Country, 'Tis of Thee", 曾经的美国国歌, 拉杰成功穿越

96
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,420
*...自由*
...liberty

97
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,460
*这真棒*
It's really great.
忘词不会唱  囧

98
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,550
当霍华德跟我说会有联调局的人来找我时
So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me,

99
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,220
我以为我盼来的是穆德
I was expecting Mulder.
穆德和斯嘉丽分别为《X档案》男女主角

100
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,410
没想到来了斯嘉丽
Glad to see I got Scully.

101
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,430
你说谁
Who?

102
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,200
穆德和斯嘉丽
Mulder and Scully.

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,390
《X档案》
X-Files.

104
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,280
"真像就在那里"...  算了当我没说
"The truth is out there." never mind.

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,330
你想了解点什么呢
Uh, so, what would you like to know?

106
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,220
你和沃罗威茨先生在大学里共事  对吧
You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,490
是的  当然  是不同的部门
Yes. Of course, we're in different departments.

108
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,530
他是个工程师  而我是实验物理学家
He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist.

109
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,660
就好比是那种
You know, one of those guys

110
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,860
建筑监理师
who examines the building blocks of creation

111
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,930
并且总会说"你好啊  宇宙的建造者"
and says, "Hello, maker of the universe.

112
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,420
"我看到了你的成果"
"I see what you did there.

113
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
"很屌哦"
Good one."

114
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,680
好吧
Right.

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
你怎么形容你和
Now, how would you characterize

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
沃罗威茨先生之间的关系呢
your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?

117
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,700
很好
Good.

118
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,960
我们关系很好
It's a good relationship.

119
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,890
当然了  我跟多数人的关系都很好
Of course, most of my relationships are good.

120
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,470
也许是因为我浑身流露着自信
Probably because I exude confidence.

121
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,010
这点很吸引人的  你懂吗
People are drawn to that, you know?

122
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,750
我是说自信  不是流"露"
Confidence, not exuding.

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,190
沃罗威茨先生是否有参加任何组织呢
Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

124
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,330
你很美  你知道吗
You are beautiful, you know that?

125
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,930
你青春  奔放  热力四射
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

126
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,850
我八点钟去接你
I'm going to pick you up at 8:00,

127
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,890
带你度过永生难忘的一晚
show you a night you will never forget.

128
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,780
听上去不错
Sounds great.

129
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,500
真的吗
Really?

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,390
我可以带上我六尺二寸[约1.89米]
Can my six-foot-two

131
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,170
在海豹部队服役的丈夫吗
Navy seal husband come with us?

132
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,760
那是
Is that...?

133
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,370
天啊  我摘了眼镜没看到你的戒指
Oh, my, I didn't see the ring with my glasses off, so...

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,420
瞧  这下我开始流"露"了
Look at that, I'm starting to exude.

135
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,320
你想去开门吗
Want to get that?

136
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,060
不是很想
Not particularly.

137
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,930
可以去开一下门吗
Could you get that?

138
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,690
要是有人求我去的话  也可以去的
I suppose I could if I were asked.

139
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,160
可不可以请你开一下门
Would you please get that?

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,380
当然可以
Of course.

141
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,320
你干吗非要把事情弄得这么复杂呢
Why do you have to make things so complicated?

142
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,980
库珀博士吗
Dr. Cooper?

143
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,760
是的
Yes.

144
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,540
我是联邦调查局探员蓓姬
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

145
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,050
你说你自己是
You say you're

146
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,740
联邦调查局探员蓓姬  空口无凭
Special Agent Page, FBI.

147
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,590
这是我的证件
Here's my I.D.

148
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,990
这是我正义联盟的会员卡
And here is my Justice League membership card.

149
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,240
但是这不能证明我认识蝙蝠侠
But that doesn't prove I know Batman.

150
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,870
我只是想问你几个
I just want to ask you a few questions

151
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,820
关于霍华德·沃罗威茨的问题
about Howard Wolowitz.

152
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,380
好吧
Oh. All right.

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,090
我想没人会冒着
I doubt anyone would risk

154
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,000
假扮联邦政府探员的重罪
the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,180
来问几个关于一个患有强烈恋母情结
just to ask questions about a minor league engineer

156
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,840
的小工程师的问题
with an unresolved oedipal complex.

157
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,030
谢谢
Thank you.

158
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,240
老实说  我非常支持
For the record, I truly support the FBI

159
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,030
联邦调查局为完成使命
in the mission which is expressed

160
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,630
所立下的誓言
through their motto...?

161
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,960
忠诚  勇敢  正直
Fidelity, bravery, and integrity.

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,840
回答正确  说正事吧
Correct. Now to business.

163
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,990
十八年前有人在我的门廊上
18 years ago, I sent the FBI crime lab samples

164
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,430
点燃了一包粪便  我从中提取了样本
from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire

165
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,780
寄给了联调局的罪案鉴证科
on my front porch...

166
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,480
为了提取指纹和化验DNA
...for fingerprinting and DNA analysis.

167
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,880
为什么我到现在还没收到任何回复呢
Why haven't I heard back yet?

168
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,960
联邦调查局的罪案鉴证科事务繁忙
Well, the FBI crime lab does have a lot on its plate.

169
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,710
这对于一个想要把烧焦的粪便
That's of little comfort to a nation

170
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,510
从鞋上刮下来的人来说可不是个好消息
attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.

171
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,960
你介不介意我们来谈一下沃罗威茨先生
Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?

172
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,320
有点介意  不过说吧
A little, but go on.

173
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,470
谢谢
Thank you.

174
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,810
你认为他是个负责任的人吗
Would you characterize him as responsible?

175
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,320
我来举证回答你这个问题吧
I'm going to answer that with a visual aid.

176
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,880
这是我的《魔戒》三部曲
This is my nine-disc complete

177
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,250
九张蓝光碟版的完整收藏
Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.

178
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,580
沃罗威茨曾经借走过
Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

179
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,390
结果把第三张碟的塑料壳弄坏了
damaged plastic retention hub number three...

180
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,440
然后就这样还给我  还指望我不会发现
...and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice.

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,230
你觉得这叫做负责任吗
Would you characterize that as responsible?

182
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,860
我们对这类事情不感兴趣
That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.

183
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,730
你听到我说这是蓝光了吧
You heard me say blu-ray, right?

184
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,610
听到了
I did.

185
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,610
很好
Very well.

186
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,050
那你想不想知道
Would you be interested

187
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,520
沃罗威茨先生曾经偷偷登录我的
in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto

188
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,480
魔兽争霸账号  然后把我一个八十级的
my World of Warcraft account and changed the name

189
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,360
术士名字由谢耳朵改成了没耳朵
of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?

190
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,330
这个也不感兴趣
I'm afraid not.

191
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,010
还有别的吗
Is there anything else?

192
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,040
"还有别的吗"
"Is there anything else"?

193
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
你想从哪里开始说起
Where would you like to start?

194
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,060
我借给他的书
He refuses to pay fines

195
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,060
他延期不还  还拒绝缴纳罚款
when he's overdue with books I lend him.

196
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,490
他为了泡妞
He crashed the Mars Rover

197
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,230
而撞毁了火星探测器
while attempting to impress a woman.

198
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,660
他推荐我去看
He recommended that I go see

199
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,370
黑客帝国三  因为  他的原话是
the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote,

200
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,250
"这部跟第一部一样精彩"
"just as good as the first one".

201
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,430
我不知道还有谁比他更不负责任的了
If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.

202
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,750
火星探测器
The Mars Rover?

203
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,830
我有说火星探测器吗
Did I say Mars Rover?

204
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,290
说了
You did.

205
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,940
这个例子其实举得很烂
That was actually a poorly chosen example,

206
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,620
因为那跟我一点关系也没有
as it had nothing to do with me.

207
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,220
没关系  我们还是来谈一下吧
Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.

208
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,130
我不想谈
I don't want to.

209
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,080
但是我不愿意谈这件事
Not that my disinclination

210
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,460
并不能证明
to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of

211
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,590
是霍华德·沃罗威茨损坏了
Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction

212
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,710
上千万美元的政府财产
of government property worth millions of dollars.

213
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,140
谢谢你  库珀博士
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

214
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,740
我想我已经问完了
I think I have all I need.

215
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,610
太好了
Oh, good.

216
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,210
我还怕你会
I was afraid you were going to fixate

217
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,400
抓着火星探测器那件事不放呢
on that Mars Rover incident.

218
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,790
伙计们
Hey, buddies.

219
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,370
猜猜谁由于没通过安全审查
Guess who didn't get security clearance

220
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,310
所以不能参与太空激光器的工作了
to work on the giant space laser?

221
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,130
怎么搞的
What happened?

222
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,420
显然  有人在背景调查时说我坏话了呗
Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well.

223
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,010
这肯定跟你们几个没关系 对吧
You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

224
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,070
实际上  我跟那个女探员谈话的时候
Well, actually, I may have gotten

225
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,510
可能有点喝醉了
a little tipsy when I talked to her.

226
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,890
我可能有点想要泡她的意思
And I may have hit on her a little bit.

227
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,390
我可能把朗姆蛋糕扔到她鞋上了
I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.

228
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,020
我知道了
I see.

229
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,350
很好  每当我需要你们的时候
Well, it's good to know, when I need you guys,

230
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,150
我总能指望你们跳出来把事情搞砸的
I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.

231
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,710
我好内疚
I feel awful.

232
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,150
我也是
Ah, me, too.

233
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,750
老实说  就算有人会搞砸
To tell you the truth,

234
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,650
霍华德的安全审核
I thought if anyone was going to

235
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,730
我也觉得应该是谢尔顿的错
screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.

236
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,830
显然你的预期被推翻了
Well, your expectations have been subverted.

237
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,870
啊哈
Aha.

238
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,020
你怎么还不睡
What are you doing up?

239
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,000
睡眠弃我而去了  莱纳德
Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,450
是么
Really?

241
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,070
可能你之前遇见过他  却错过了
Maybe sleep has met you before.

242
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,580
这算是讽刺么
Mockery?

243
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,210
你就不能说些别的吗
That's all you have to offer?

244
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,760
不好意思  你为什么睡不着
I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

245
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,930
谁知道呢
Who knows?

246
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,680
我最近又没看什么惊悚片
I haven't watched any scary movies recently.

247
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,200
也不再纠结为什么
I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass

248
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,250
量子真空质量的预测
of the quantum vacuum has little effect

249
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,170
对宇宙膨胀作用甚微
on the expansion of the universe.

250
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,620
我不小心喝了一小口红牛也是好几周前的事了
And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.

251
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,550
那今天发生了什么事让你纠结
Did something happen today that's bothering you?

252
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,500
我的确是对联调局探员
Well, I did mention

253
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,420
提到了火星探测器那件事
the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent

254
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,050
也许这害得霍华德没通过安全审核
and probably cost Howard his security clearance.

255
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,630
-啥  -但我为什么睡不着呢
- What? - But why should that keep me up?

256
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,930
因为你感到愧疚么
Because you feel guilty?

257
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,590
有意思
Interesting.

258
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,880
你是说我失眠是因为愧疚感作祟
So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.

259
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,730
其实你没有失眠
Actually, you don't have insomnia.

260
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,960
你正在睡觉
You're sleeping now.

261
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,160
你说啥
Excuse me?

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,090
你正在一个因内疚感而生的梦境里
You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

263
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,880
你这么说有什么证据吗
Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?

264
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,570
看到沙发上那个戈恩人了吗[星际迷航]
How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?

265
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,350
好吧  很有说服力
That seems fairly conclusive.

266
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,600
不  戈恩
No, Gorn, no.

267
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,920
那是我的位子
That's where I sit.

268
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,980
多谢你同意见我  蓓姬探员
Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.

269
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,810
多谢你向我上级投诉我  库珀博士
Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

270
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,200
我明白你想要撤销
I understand you want to recant

271
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,250
你对霍华德·沃罗威茨的说辞
your statement about Howard Wolowitz.

272
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,540
-没错  -你的说辞是假的吗
- Yes. - Was your statement untrue?

273
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,970
是真的
No.

274
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,890
那我恐怕你没法撤销
Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.

275
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,040
不好意思  你可没说"不得回传"
I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying "No backsies."

276
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,650
还有其它事吗
Is there anything else?

277
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,630
有  我想发表一番对霍华德
Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement

278
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,940
许多优秀品质的赞美
about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe

279
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,480
我相信这能扭转局势
will tip the scales back in his favor.

280
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,410
霍华德·约尔·沃罗威茨
"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

281
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,820
H代表诚实  他的确相当诚实
"H is for honesty, of which he has much.

282
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,440
O代表杰出
"O's for outstanding,

283
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,700
他也正是如此
"Which he is such.

284
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,360
W代表风趣  他的确很会讲笑话
"W's for witty, he's quick with a joke.

285
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,490
-A代表艺术才华  他可以...  -我很抱歉
- A's for artistic, his ability..." - I'm sorry.

286
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,500
库珀博士  这没得谈了
Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.

287
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,930
但名字的剩余部分我还没说完呢
But I still have "rd Joel Wolowitz" Left to go.

288
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,790
这事儿已经完结了
It's closed.

289
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,470
我真搞不懂你们这帮人
I don't understand why you people

290
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,980
要找我朋友霍华德的茬
are picking on my friend, Howard,

291
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,560
这个国家还面临着其它更严重的威胁
when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.

292
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,660
比如  我最初遇到莱纳德的时候
For instance, when I first met Leonard,

293
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,020
他就差点把导弹机密
he was on the verge of giving away

294
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,170
透露给一个朝鲜间谍
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy,

295
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,340
但却没有一个探员去调查这事
and not one agent ever investigated that.

296
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,350
你是指莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德吗
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

297
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,410
不  是另一个叫莱纳德的
No, it's a different Leonard.

298
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,740
他...
He's...

299
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,360
他是中国人  红头发  六根手指  再见
Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.

300
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,330
拉杰
Raj.

301
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,790
你看到霍华德了吗
Have you seen Howard?

302
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,630
我想他在吃饭吧
I think he's eating lunch.

303
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,290
谢尔顿  这位是尼尔·德格拉斯·泰森
Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil DeGrasse Tyson

304
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,440
纽约海登天文馆馆长
from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.

305
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
我和泰森博士挺熟呢
I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

306
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,010
都归功于他的一家之言
He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto

307
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,690
冥王星不再是行星了
from planetary status.

308
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,280
我喜欢冥王星
I liked Pluto.

309
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,630
所以我不喜欢你
Ergo I do not like you.

310
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,680
其实不是我的一家之言
But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

311
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,350
而是国际天文联合会投票决定的
That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.

312
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,510
要是总拿"如果"和"但是"来糊弄我们
If "Ifs" And "Buts" Were candy and nuts,

313
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,000
圣诞节可不会开心的是吧
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

314
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,290
好好想想吧  泰森博士
Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

315
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,310
你和我说的就是他吗
Is that the guy you were telling me about?

316
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,310
没错
Oh, yeah.

317
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,640
霍华德
Howard.

318
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,150
害你没通过安全审核的人是我
The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.

319
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,020
是你
You?

320
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,150
对  在你发飙之前  我要告诉你
Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know

321
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,630
我去找了联调局的人撤回我的说辞
I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.

322
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,750
他们同意了吗
And they were okay with that?

323
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,370
不  那啥  反而更糟了
No. If anything, I made it worse.

324
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,760
不管怎样  我充满了罪恶感
In any case, I have been riddled with guilt,

325
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,390
搞得戈恩人都跑进了我梦里
which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep.

326
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,980
所以我来对你说抱歉
So, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.

327
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,930
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

328
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,480
你害得我的职业发展倒退了至少两年
You've set my career back at least two years,

329
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,570
你觉得说句抱歉就能算了吗
and you think you can make it right with "I'm sorry"?

330
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,230
是的
Yes.

331
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,920
我遵循了社交礼仪
I followed the social protocol.

332
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,700
曾努力想要纠正错误  但我失败了
I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so,

333
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,420
所以我表示诚挚的抱歉
I delivered a heartfelt apology.

334
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,470
现在你得说
Now you say,

335
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,600
"我接受你的道歉"
"Apology accepted,"

336
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,350
而我和你击下掌  仅此一次
and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.

337
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,310
我不接受你的道歉
Your apology is not accepted.

338
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,060
你开玩笑吧
You're tricking me.

339
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,680
其实你接受了吧
It really is, isn't it?

340
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,030
别烦我  谢尔顿
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

341
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,230
库珀博士  我想告诉你
Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know

342
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,630
我很抱歉我对冥王星的所作所为
I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.

343
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,600
闭嘴
Oh, shut up.

344
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,290
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

345
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,050
你好
Hello.

346
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,860
你怎么会在这
What are you doing here?

347
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,300
我有麻烦了  佩妮
I have troubles, Penny.

348
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,390
我想来找充满同情心的
I've come to pour them out

349
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,300
当地酒吧酒保一吐心事
to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.

350
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,670
其实橄榄园那边就有个不错的酒吧
You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.

351
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,030
我不喜欢橄榄园
I don't like the Olive Garden.

352
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,470
他们对我跟家人似的
They treat me like family.

353
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,910
-好吧谢尔顿  想喝点什么  -酒
- Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?  - Alcohol.

354
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,730
能再具体点吗
Could you be a little more specific?

355
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,170
乙醇
Ethyl alcohol.

356
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,070
40毫升
40 milliliters.

357
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,000
抱歉亲爱的  我不懂毫升制
I'm sorry, honey. I don't know milliliters.

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,510
那得怪詹姆斯·吉米·卡特总统
Ah. Blame President James "Jimmy" Carter.

359
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,110
他让美国开始实行公制体系
He started America on a path to the metric system

360
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,960
却又半途而废
but then just gave up.

361
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,550
他还想不明白自己为何不能连任总统
He wonders why he was a one-term president.

362
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,420
你说这里差不多是40毫升吧
Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?

363
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,480
-差不多  -很好
- More or less.  - Great.

364
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,780
咱说到哪了
Now, where were we?

365
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,650
相信你马上就要让我点一种鸡尾酒了
I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail.

366
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,000
幸好  拜嗜酒的电脑通们所赐
Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics,

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,140
正好有开发这应用
there's an app for that.

368
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,150
看看
Let's see.

369
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,290
哈维撞墙  算了
Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

370
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,590
海滩性爱  我可不要
Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so.

371
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,210
罗布罗伊  丝绸拖鞋  疯狂鞋匠
Rob Roy, silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

372
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,850
给我来一杯玫瑰花水里奇
I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

373
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,540
-什么酒  -需用到去核酒酿的樱桃  琴酒
- A what? - You'll need pitted,brandied cherries, gin,

374
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,170
玫瑰花水  安古斯图拉苦味酒和高度朗姆酒
rosewater, Angostura Bitters and overproofed rum.

375
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,650
首先  在樱桃上撒上糖
Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar,

376
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,430
然后喷上朗姆和苦味酒
then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters.

377
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,810
再点燃朗姆酒  将饴糖...
Then ignite the rum, caramel...

378
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,830
给你  你的玫瑰花水里奇
Here you go -- one Rosewater Ricky.

379
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,920
跟照片上的不像
That's not how it looks in the picture.

380
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,290
是啊  不过每位酒保调法都稍有差异
Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently.

381
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,080
何不试试再说
Why don't you give it a try.

382
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,130
好吧
All right.

383
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,880
敬公制体系
To the metric system.

384
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,490
我没尝到有樱桃味
I can't taste the cherries.

385
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,670
好吧  谢尔顿  你到底在烦恼什么
All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?

386
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,890
我对不起霍华德  他不接受我的道歉
I wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.

387
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,050
哦那件事啊
Oh, right, that.

388
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,670
莱纳德跟我说了  很遗憾亲爱的
Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

389
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,380
佩妮  你每天都面对着失败
Penny, you face failure on a daily basis.

390
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,760
你是怎么处理的
How do you cope?

391
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,240
我喝酒啊
I drink.

392
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,960
敬喝酒
To drinking.

393
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,310
不行
Nope.

394
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,510
真希望有什么能强迫霍华德接受我的道歉
If only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology

395
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,450
让我逃脱这内疚的深渊
so I could escape this miasma of guilt.

396
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,340
有些事它注定要发生
You know, sometimes stuff just happens,

397
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,870
你是无能为力的
and there's nothing you can do about it.

398
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,840
比如  丽莎·皮特森从高二就不跟我讲话
Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade,

399
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,620
因为不管怎么道歉
because no matter how much you apologize,

400
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,720
都改变不了勾走她男友的事实
you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

401
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,640
我明白了
I see.

402
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,750
你是说我面对的是星舰学院
You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's

403
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,560
不可能完成的测试  小林丸号测验
unwinnable command scenario: the Kobayashi Maru.

404
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,410
没错
Exactly.

405
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,780
有时候注定你赢不了
Sometimes you can't win.

406
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,940
柯克船长就赢了
Captain Kirk won.

407
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,190
柯克作弊了
Kirk cheated.

408
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,840
真不敢相信你知道这个
Impressive that you know that.

409
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,280
难以置信我竟然跟你在讨论这些
It's hard to believe i'm actually having this conversation with you.

410
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,210
佩妮与你同在
Right there with you.

411
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,070

412
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,850
-就这么办  -什么
- That's it. - What?

413
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,610
-我要改编霍华德  -什么
- I'll reprogram Howard. - What...?

414
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,860
谢尔顿  人是没法改编的
Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

415
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,440
不  是你不能改编而已
No, you can't reprogram people.

416
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,560
敬詹姆斯·T·柯克船长
To James Tiberius Kirk.

417
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,340
各位好
Hello, all.

418
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,310
霍华德  今天没那么生我气了  是吗
Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?

419
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,040
不是
Not really.

420
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,810
一定是的
Yes, you are.

421
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,880
我正用神经语言学规划法
I'm using neurolinguistic programming

422
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,350
修正你的思考模式
to modify your thought patterns.

423
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
滚远点  谢尔顿
Go away, Sheldon.

424
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,870
将近10美元买的那电子书就这么废掉了
There's a $9.95 e-book down the drain.

425
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,950
那袋子里是什么
What's in the bag?

426
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,380
是给霍华德的
It's for Howard.

427
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,830
谢尔顿  这事不是送个礼就能算了的
Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.

428
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,400
不管怎么说  我伤害了你
Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

429
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,130
不管你原不原谅我  我都要给你这个
and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.

430
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,850
你送我个沙发垫
You're giving me a couch cushion?

431
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,360
不是
No.

432
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,130
垫子只是象征性的
The cushion is merely symbolic.

433
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,510
我送你的是我沙发上的专座
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

434

435
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,680
不  我很爱我妈妈

436
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,080
而我对我专座的感情  要强烈得多
My feelings for my spot are much greater.

437
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,510
它是宇宙中独一无二属于我的
It is the singular location in space

438
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,430
环绕着它  是属于我的整个宇宙

439
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,760
现在它是你的了
And now it's yours.

440
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,610
天哪兄弟  你一定要原谅他
Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.

441
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,090
好吧
All right.

442
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,720
我接受你的道歉

443
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,160
击掌
High five.

444
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,150
别太用力

不得不承认
I got to tell you, Sheldon,

448
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,540
谢尔顿  我总算明白你为何选这个专座了
I understand why you chose this spot.

449
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,600
温度正好  也没什么风
I mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft.

450
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,890
能观赏电视  同时还能聊天...
I can see the television, but I can still talk to...

451
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,020
我改主意了  滚出我的专座
I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.

452
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,150
多久
How long?

453
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,060
94秒
94 seconds.
