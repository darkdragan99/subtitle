1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,280
嗨  帮我个忙  去七号桌点菜吧
Hey, do me a favor and take Table Seven.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,700
你是说有我那个118磅重的
You mean the one with my 118-pound

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,450
性欲旺盛的最近可能得了
rock-hard stud of a fiance

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,970
口腔溃疡和红眼病的未婚夫的那桌吗
who's prone to canker sores and pinkeye?

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,630
不对  我更愿意看作是有我的前男友
Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,180
和她那美丽成功而知性的女友的那桌
and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend,

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,270
那女孩让我觉得自己就像个没用的乡巴佬
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,090
你想让我往她身上洒热汤吗
Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,350
拜托  你不是那种人
Oh, please-- you're not that kind of person.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,430
我知道
I know.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,420
但如果她点了低脂食物的话
But if she orders something low-fat

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,160
我绝对可以给她端上全脂的
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,090
这杯水是我的
Uh, that's my water.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,840
什么
What?

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,150
我的水  你喝的是我的水
My water. You're drinking it.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,950
苍天啊
D-Dear Lord!

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,880
你喝过吗
Have you been drinking it?

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,790
肯定啊  都说了是我的水了
Yes. It's my water.

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,220
那完蛋了
Well, that's it then.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,420
我死翘翘了
I'm dead.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,980
又来了
Here we go...

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,890
不好意思  但非得让我把话挑明了吗
I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you?

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,660
流回到这个杯子里的
The backwash into this glass

24
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,980
是在你那所谓温暖的家的嘴里待过的每一个病原体
is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home.

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,550
更别提那些来自你那次大陆女友的
Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,640
舌头上的外来病原体了
of your subtropical girlfriend.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,400
喂  你这是在诋毁
Hey! That's my sister

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,250
我妹妹和我的祖国
and my country you're talking about.

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,530
莱纳德也许玷污了其中一个
Leonard may have defiled one,

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,160
但我绝对不允许你再侮辱另外一个
but I won't have you talking smack about the other.

31
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,190
你们准备好点菜了吗
You guys ready to order?

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,990
准备好了  我要七天疗程的青霉素
Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin,

33
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,340
一定量的吐根糖浆  催吐用的
some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting.

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,720
再来颗薄荷糖
and a mint.

35
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,280
我没听明白
I don't understand.

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,760
他喝了莱纳德杯子里的水
He drank from Leonard's glass.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,110
"他喝了莱纳德杯子里的水"
"He drank from Leonard's glass"--

38
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,300
这句话得刻在我的墓碑上
the words they'll be carving into my tombstone.

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,670
这餐巾其实也是我的
That's actually my napkin.

40
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,460
坑死爹了
Oh, this is a nightmare!

41
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,530
-你要去哪儿  -去酒吧
- Where are you going? - To the bar,

42
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,140
用酒精给口腔消毒
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

43
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,070
快让开  行尸走肉来了
Gang way! Dead man walking!

44
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,310

生活大爆炸第四季第二十三集

49
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,210
好的  拿好了
All right. Here you go.

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,020
两杯柠檬汽水
Two lemonades,

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,710
一杯冰茶
one iced tea

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,980
还有普丽娅的一杯根汁汽水
and a root beer for Priya.

53
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,950
-是无糖的吗  -这就是你点的
- Is it diet? - That's what you ordered.

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,850
谢谢
Thank you.

55
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,870
嗨  你和霍华德
Hey, have you and Howard

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,730
开始计划婚礼了吗
started planning your wedding yet?

57
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,640
嗯  我们想在一个能俯视大海的
Yeah. We're thinking of having it on a cliff

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,620
悬崖上办婚礼
overlooking the ocean.

59
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,510
没什么能比担心摔下去溺死
Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters

60
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,570
更能缓解婚礼前的紧张了
like the thought of falling and drowning.

61
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,310
你跟你妈妈说
What did your mother say

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,150
你俩要结婚的时候  她说啥了吗
when you told her you were getting married?

63
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,270
他还没跟他妈妈说
He hasn't told her yet.

64
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,480
他在等合适的时机
He's waiting for the right time.

65
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,550
其实我想把这事儿编进悼词里
I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,160
霍华德  你必须告诉你妈妈
Howard, you've got to tell your mother.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,500
喂  你跟你爸妈说了你在
Hey, have you told your parents you're dating

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,400
跟这一小杯"脱脂牛奶"约会吗
this short glass of skim milk here?

69
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,650
呃  这不一样
Uh... that's different.

70
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,500
首先  我们还没订婚
First of all, we're not engaged;

71
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,180
其次  印度父母
and second, Indian parents

72
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,090
都对孩子很不放心的
are very protective of their children.

73
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,020
是啊是啊  而犹太母亲
Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers

74
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,820
一般都任自己的儿子自生自灭的
take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

75
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,630
我在用龙舌兰酒漱口的时候貌似咽下了一点点
I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.

76
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,900
-你没事吧  -没事
- You all right? - Fine.

77
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,420
多谢关心
Thank you for asking.

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,400
我好爱你哦
I love you so much.

79
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,510
火魔
Fire demon.

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,620
哇  火魔
Ooh, fire demon.

81
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,840
谢尔顿开始引爆游戏热度了
Sheldon's turning up the heat...

82
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,770
巨怪首领
Troll master.

83
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,820
看啊  霍华德从流氓团伙里
Check it! Howard pulls one out

84
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,250
拽出了一只巨怪首领  漂亮
from under the bridge. Nice!

85
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,750
水仙女
Water nymph.

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,660
哦也  她的"那个地方"
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles

87
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,600
充满了粘液
in all the right places.

88
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,840
劳驾您能在打牌的时候
Could you please play the game

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,370
别老是打一张解说一句吗
without commenting on every card?

90
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,210
抱歉
Sorry.

91
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,800
树怪
Walking tree.

92
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,430
下不为例
Last one.

93
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,770
我是运动的树  我在散步
I'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.

94
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,850
好吧  终于还是发生了
Okay, the <i>Eagle</i> has landed.

95
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,730
怎么了
What's going on?

96
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,080
伯纳黛特和我妈妈正在
Bernadette and my mother are having

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,520
老镇餐厅第一次共进午餐
a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.

98
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,820
听起来不错啊
Oh, that sounds lovely.

99
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,680
但愿如此
Hope so.

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,980
当然  根据以往的经验
Of course, if history is any indication,

101
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,110
我老妈会把她囫囵吞了
my mother will swallow her whole

102
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,110
然后像猫头鹰一样把骨头吐出来
and spit out her bones like an owl.

103
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,160
你见过伯纳黛特的父母了吗
Have you met Bernadette's parents?

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,850
你是说希特勒和爱娃吗
You mean Adolf and Eva?
阿道夫·希特勒曾疯狂地屠杀过犹太人  爱娃是他的老婆

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,850
还没呢
Not yet.

106
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,810
一步一步来嘛
One goose step at a time.

107
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,820
谢尔顿  这杯水是我的
Sheldon, that's my water.

108
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,800
苍天啊
Oh, dear Lord!

109
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,840
那杯水不是你的
That's not your water.

110
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,980
我知道
I know.

111
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,290
我的漱口液在哪儿呢
Where's the mouthwash?!

112
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,930
在哪儿呢
"Where" indeed.

113
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,060
妈  我回来了
Ma, I'm home!

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,200
你在哪
Where are you?

115
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,530
我在厕所
I'm in the toilet!

116
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,610
进行得怎么样
So, how'd it go?!

117
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,990
现在还说不准呢
Too soon to say!

118
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,790
我还没拉完呢
I'm not done yet!

119
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,040
我是说你跟伯纳黛特的午饭吃的怎么样
No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette!

120
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,320
我吃了个五香熏肉三明治
I had a pastrami sandwich.

121
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,680
她吃了个茄子肉酱千层面
She had eggplant lasagna.

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,020
就好像在犹太餐馆就该点这种东西吃
Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.

123
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,670
除了吃的以外呢  你们相处得怎么样
Besides food, did you get along?

124
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,510
你们聊天了吗
Did you talk?

125
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,030
当然了  你知道吗
Oh, sure! Did you know she's going to school

126
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,560
她正在读微生物学呢
to become a microbiologist?!

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,290
不知道  她还真没提过
No, she never mentioned it.

128
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,490
她肯定提过  是你没注意听
I bet she did and you didn't listen!

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,400
没准吧  那你觉得她怎么样
Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think?

130
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
你喜欢她吗  她是个好女孩对吧
Do you like her? She's great, huh?

131
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
她是个挺可爱的
She's a lovely girl!

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,970
超级可爱
Cute as a button!

133
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,190
听你这么说我就放心了  因为我有事要跟你说
That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.

134
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,830
最好是好事
I hope it's good news,

135
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,080
因为我在厕所里进展可不怎么样  都快郁闷死了
because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!

136
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,450
我要跟伯纳黛特结婚了
Bernadette and I are getting married.

137
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,090
妈
Ma?

138
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,750
你正忙着使劲呢吗
You too busy bearing down?

139
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,050
妈
Ma?

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,600
天啊  妈  妈  妈
Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

141
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
退后点  我要撞门了
Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down!

142
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,270
该死的  妈  救我
Son of a bitch! Ma, help!

143
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,180
你好
Hello.

144
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,330
好久不见了
Haven't seen you in a while.

145
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,440
你最近咋样啊
How's it going?

146
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,610
除了等着那些致命的有机物
Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period

147
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,420
沿着我的绒毛组织
of the virulent organisms

148
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,180
侵入我的血液循环系统外
trooping through my microvilli

149
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,180
就没啥特别的了
into my circulatory system -- hunky-dory.

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,730
很好笑吗
Did I say something amusing?

151
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,230
不知道  也许吧  我完全没听懂你在说什么
I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,270
这么说你刚才的欢笑声只是为了释放你的紧张情绪
So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy

153
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,140
没有任何实际意义咯
with no semantic content at all?

154
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,690
我的欢笑声  还真是谢尔顿的经典语录啊
My mirth. Classic.

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,170
我啥时候才能理解
Is there a station coming up

156
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,000
你这些奇怪的笑声呀
where I can board your giggling train of thought?

157
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,670
这没啥大不了的  谢尔顿
It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

158
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,400
只是  自从莱纳德跟拉杰的妹妹在一起之后
It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister,

159
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
我就得跟你们保持距离了
I've had to keep my distance.

160
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,660
我就没机会听你的这些胡言乱语了
I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.

161
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,130
胡言乱语
Jibber-jabber?!

162
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,590
我才不会胡言乱语呢
I don't jibber-jabber.

163
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,280
你这段时间上班都忙什么呢
What are you doing at work these days?

164
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,890
我在研究弦理论的
Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds

165
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,040
时间依赖性
in string theory,

166
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,030
尤其是量子场论
specifically quantum field theory

167
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,140
在德西特时空d维空间中的应用
in "d-dimensional" de Sitter space.

168
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,160
拜托  这下你总得承认那是胡言乱语了吧
Okay, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.

169
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,920
有意思  你知不知道
Interesting, do you know

170
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,840
胡言乱语这个词是怎么来的
where the phrase "jibber-jabber" comes from?

171
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,720
天啊  你就要说一堆关于胡言乱语的
Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,600
胡言乱语了
about jibber-jabber.

173
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,730
霍华德和他妈进医院了
Howard and his mother are at the hospital.

174
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,430
-快点  咱们走  -天啊  出什么事了
- Come on, we gotta go.  - Oh, my God! What happened?

175
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,070
不知道  我只是收到短信而已  快点  快走
I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.

176
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,440
好吧
Okay.

177
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,100
谢尔顿  走啦
Sheldon, let's go!

178
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,030
去医院吗
To a hospital?!

179
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,960
那个满是病人的地方
Full of sick people?!

180
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,460
我才不去呢
Oh, I don't think so.

181
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,560
你朋友和他母亲都进医院了
Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there,

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
你非去不可
we're going.

183
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
我不要
I can't.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,110
别跟我说你怕细菌啊
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.

185
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,120
不是所有的细菌
Not all germs.

186
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,960
我只怕那些会让我病死的细菌
Just the ones that will kill me.

187
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,130
就像是我并不是害怕所有的餐刀
It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives --

188
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,650
我只怕那些会捅死我的餐刀
just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.

189
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,450
好吧  那我就跟霍华德说
Fine, I'll tell Howard you didn't come

190
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,350
你没去医院是因为比起他的健康
because you're more concerned

191
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,210
你更担心你自己的身体
about your own well-being than his.

192
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,870
我想他是很清楚这一点的
I would think he would know that.

193
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,530
好吧  算了吧  你简直不可理喻
Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable.

194
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,480
你买了那么多超级英雄的恤衫
You buy all these superhero T-shirts,

195
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,240
可是到了你该挺身而出
but when it's time for you

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,670
做点正确的事的时候
to step up and do the right thing,

197
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,050
你就只会躲在洗衣房里
you just hide in the laundry room.

198
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,040
好吧  我去就是了
Fine, I'll go.

199
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,780
不过事先声明
Just for the record,

200
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,250
我的舅妈露丝就是死在医院里的
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

201
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,320
她去医院探望我舅舅罗杰
She went in to visit my Uncle Roger,

202
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,770
结果却染上了病  结果一周后就挂了
caught something and bit the dust a week later.

203
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,280
他俩现在都被装在我妈壁炉架上的
The two of them now share a coffee can

204
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,050
同一个咖啡罐里
on my mother's mantel.

205
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,960
于是我撞开了洗手间的门
So I knocked down the bathroom door,

206
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,560
抬起我那不省人事的母亲
picked up my poor unconscious mother,

207
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,380
把她抱上车
carried her to the car,

208
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,190
然后像个疯子一样开来了急诊室
and drove like a madman to the emergency room.

209
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,340
你真是个英雄  霍华德
You're a real hero, Howard.

210
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,840
不  我只是尽了一个儿子应尽的义务而已
No, I did what any son would do.

211
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,560
等一下  你抱起了你母亲
Hang on a second -- you picked up your mother?

212
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,060
她的体重连她自己的双腿都支撑不住
Her own legs are barely able to do that.

213
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,460
都是肾上腺素的作用
I was filled with adrenaline.

214
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,080
就像是母亲为了救出车下的婴儿  可以把车抬起来一样
It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.

215
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,650
我就是这个意思  抬车都比抬你妈容易
Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.

216
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,520
怎么说呢  在我鼓足了勇气
What can I tell you? After I found the courage

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,580
提上她的裤子之后  人类就阻挡不了我了
to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.

218
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,940
你妈妈现在怎样
So, how is she?

219
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,950
还在作检查  我不知道
They're running tests-- I don't know.

220
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,720
可能是心脏病发作或类似心脏病发作
It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.

221
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,690
有何区别
What's the difference?

222
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,460
类似心脏病发作
A heart-attack-like event

223
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,430
就是指类似发作心脏病的症状
is an event that's like a heart attack.

224
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,170
谢谢说明
Thanks for clearing that up.

225
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,210
当然  冠状心脏疾患是可治的
Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable.

226
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,360
真正害死霍华德妈妈的
What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother

227
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,820
是在这医院每条沟沟壑壑里
are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs

228
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,850
溃烂着的耐抗生素的超级臭虫们
festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.

229
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,470
拜托  你别添乱了
Okay, you're not helping.

230
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,110
我不同意
Disagree.

231
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,380
去  那边坐着去
Go sit over there.

232
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,610
我要坐那里   看着更干净
I'll sit over there-- it looks cleaner.

233
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,810
你们家族有心脏病史吗
Is there a history of heart disease in your family?

234
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,080
我的家族史  整个就是一心脏病史
My family is the history of heart disease.

235
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,020
法国有处洞穴壁画
There's a cave painting in France

236
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,280
画的就是我一老祖宗在这样
of one of my ancestors doing this:

237
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,170
那这可能是遗传的咯
So it's probably genetic.

238
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,530
可能吧
Well, maybe.

239
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,510
妈妈还听到了些可能让她心烦的消息
Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.

240
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,790
什么
What?

241
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,350
这不重要
It's not important.

242
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,820
说吧  霍华德  我将是你妻子
Come on, Howard, I'm going to be your wife.

243
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,350
你可以跟我分享任何事
You can share anything with me.

244
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,570
你这么想  但并不是的
You'd think that. But no.

245
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,340
你告诉她我们要结婚
You told her we were going to get married

246
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,140
然后她就心脏病发作了吗
and she had a heart attack?

247
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,910
你千万别多想
You can't take that personally.

248
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,860
那让她还能怎么想
How else is she supposed to take it?

249
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,410
你只要记住的是
What you've got to keep in mind is that

250
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,270
我爸去世后
ever since my dad left,

251
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,830
我就是我妈妈的整个世界
I've been the whole world to my mother.

252
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,680
她会觉得其他能做到她所不能的
I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman

253
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,430
任何女人  都是威胁
who can give me what she can't.

254
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,400
你是指性爱
You mean sexual intercourse?

255
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,170
你这么一说  就显得怪怪的
Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.

256
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,170
怎么了
What happened?

257
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,730
霍华德妈妈心脏病发作
Howard's mother had a heart attack

258
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,950
是因为我跟他上床  而她自己不能
because I have sex with him and she can't.

259
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,210
妮妮  等等
Bernie, wait!

260
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,010
你载我回家  我就给你一千块
I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.

261
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
你能来医院看霍华德真好
Nice of you to come for Howard.

262
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,020
他是我朋友嘛  应该的
Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,180
抱歉  怎么了
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

264
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,450
只是觉得怪怪的
It's just so weird.

265
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,810
霍华德·沃罗威茨是我朋友
Howard Wolowitz is my friend.

266
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,310
有次他想深吻我
You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat

267
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,400
被我打破了鼻子
and I broke his nose.

268
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,770
这比他是你朋友更容易相信点
That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.

269
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,430
是啊  谁说不是呢
Yeah, tell me about it.

270
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,080
我哥在印度有一大群像他一样的朋友
You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India.

271
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,920
都穿紧身连衣裤戴护目镜
They dressed up in leotards and goggles

272
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,850
并自称"新德里恐龙战队"
and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.

273
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,780
你是指他小时候吗
You mean when he was little.

274
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,550
没你想的那么小
Not as little as you'd want him to be.

275
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,310
这咖啡太难喝了
You know, this stuff is horrible.

276
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,650
想去找看看有没餐厅
You want to see if we can find the cafeteria

277
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,820
-买杯好咖啡吗  -当然
- and get real coffee? - Sure.

278
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
我们要去餐厅买咖啡
We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee.

279
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,700
有人要吗
You want anything?

280
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,120
我不用了
I'm fine.

281
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,690
她们能合得来真好
That's nice that they're getting along.

282
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,380
你现任和前任女友一起玩
Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

283
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,230
没错  对你来说只可能是好事
Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.

284
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,340
你什么意思啊
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,360
其中一位跟你分手了
One of them broke up with you.

286
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,380
你真想她告诉另一位为什么吗
Do you really want her telling the other one why?

287
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,600
无所谓
I don't care.

288
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,110
我又没什么藏着掖着
I don't have anything to hide.

289
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,100
很好  很好
Good, good.

290
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,930
那你就没什么好担心的了
Then you have nothing to worry about.

291
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,420
对  我一点不担心
No, I do not.

292
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,610
你这个卑鄙小人
You are a mean little man.

293
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,380
你这么以为是因为我父母并不爱我
You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me,

294
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,130
但事实上他们非常爱我
but actually they loved me a great deal.

295
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,760
妮妮  绝不是因为你
Bernie, it's not you.

296
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,790
那只是她自以为是
She's just set in her ways.

297
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,440
那我们还怎么能在一起  如果
How can we be together if the thought of us

298
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,100
我们结婚可能会害死你妈啊
getting married might kill your mother?

299
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,850
这就是生命的轮回啊  亲爱的
It's the circle of life, sweetie.

300
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,200
未来有天我们儿子结婚  会害死你
One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.

301
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,550
霍华德  我得上洗手间
Howard, I have to go to the bathroom

302
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,080
但没人肯载我回家
and no one will take me home.

303
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,900
这里的洗手间怎么了
What's wrong with the bathroom here?

304
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
这里有肺炎球菌  链球菌  葡萄球菌
Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus

305
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,980
和其他各种球菌
and other assorted coccuses.

306
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,840
谢尔顿  我妈生命垂危
Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed

307
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,550
而我未婚妻正极度悲伤于害她入院
and my fiance is grief-stricken over putting her there.

308
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,650
我才不要载你回家
I'm not taking you home.

309
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,340
那你至少能陪我去厕所吗
Will you at least go with me to the restroom here,

310
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,230
好帮我开个门  冲个尿池
so you can open the door and flush the urinal?

311
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,560
不去
No!

312
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,010
现在或许是指出真理的最佳时期  霍华德
This might be a good time to point out, Howard,

313
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,680
友情在一定程度上是需要相互忍让的
that friendship requires a certain give and take.

314
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,120
先别关门
Hold the door.

315
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
沃罗威茨先生
Mr. Wolowitz?

316
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,640
-她还好吗  -您母亲不是心脏病突发
- Is she okay? - It wasn't a heart attack.

317
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,250
她现在醒了  在安稳地休息呢
She's awake, she's resting comfortably--

318
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,730
我们还在为她做身体检查
we're still running tests.

319
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,800
我可以进去看她吗
Can I see her?

320
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,060
其实她有吩咐  原话是这样的
Actually, she said, and I quote,

321
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,500
她想"先见那个天主教的小妞"
she'd "like to see the little Catholic girl first."

322
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,270
我  为什么是我
Me? Why me?

323
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,140
这个问题犹太人扪心自问了好几个世纪了
Jews have been asking that for centuries.

324
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,280
至今没什么好答案
There's no real good answer.

325
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,430
好吧  祝我好运
Okay, well, wish me luck.

326
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,940
别担心  没事的
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

327
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,540
先把十字架藏起来
Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

328
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,360
如果那玩意儿碰到她  会烧伤的
If it touches her, it burns.

329
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,190
-你带一个天主教的女孩回家见你妈  -是的
- You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother? - Yeah.
在犹太人遭受的千年大迫害中  十字军东征曾掀起迫害犹太人的高潮

330
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,190
那我给你开点镇静剂吧
Why don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,710
总是完事了
Finally.

332
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,630
小心  生化危害

333
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,860
隔离室
采用传染性疾病护理程序

334
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,100
这又是哪门子新玩意儿
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

335
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,290
等等  你不能离开这儿  你已经被感染了
Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.

336
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,490
不  我没有
No, I haven't.

337
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,490
防护措施做得很好
It's all good.

338
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,280
你想聊极品老妈这个话题吗
You want to talk about crazy mothers,

339
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,870
莱纳德的妈妈对他没表示过半点的认可
Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.

340
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,500
可怜的小家伙
Oh, the poor thing.

341
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,520
所以他才会这么渴望取悦女人
It makes him desperate to please women.

342
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,800
也正是他的小前戏耍不停的原因
That's why the foreplay goes on and on.

343
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,990
的确  对吧
It does, doesn't it?

344
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,400
他好像为了要获得奖励一样
It's like he's trying to win a prize.

345
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,360
佩妮贴心小建议  千万不要打瞌睡
A word of advice-- don't doze off.

346
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,370
不然你都听不见何时结束
You will never hear the end of it.

347
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,480
救我
Help me!

348
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,210
回来
Come back!

349
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,860
佩妮
Penny!

350
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,080
我跟佩妮一起做过一些事
There are a couple of things I did with Penny

351
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,940
听上去可能有点傻  但是
that might be a little silly, but...

352
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,120
比如
Like what?

353
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,140
偶尔  在我们上床前
Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed,

354
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,630
我会为她表演点小节目
I'd put on a little show for her.

355
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,440
你的"小节目"是指什么
What do you mean "a show"?

356
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,250
这个嘛  就是我脱衣服的方式
Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.

357
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,280
比如伴着音乐
Like, to music?

358
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,930
如果没音乐  那我看起来不很傻啊
I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.

359
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,540
那你跳的是脱衣舞咯
So you'd do a striptease?

360
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,270
我又不是抱着根钢管搔首弄姿
I wasn't swinging around a pole.

361
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,310
不错  不错
Good, good.

362
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,610
不过有次我往身上擦了闪粉
There was one time I put body glitter on.

363
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,720
我觉得你不必为了佩妮会不会
Well, I don't think you have to worry

364
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,460
把这事告诉我妹妹而担心
about Penny telling my sister that.

365
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,860
对  她不会说的
No, she wouldn't.

366
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,080
你的问题在我会不会告诉她
Your big problem is me telling her.

367
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,400
你还真是个卑鄙小人
You really are a mean little man.

368
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,820
天啊  的确如此
Oh, God, that's so true.

369
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,490
的确  我懂  对吧
Yeah, I know, right?

370
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,830
你们俩怎么去这么半天
Hey, what took you guys so long?

371
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,710
我们聊天来着
Oh, we were just chatting.

372
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,290
不错嘛  聊什么了
That's nice. What about?

373
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,450
我们只是对你的床上功夫
We were just comparing notes

374
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,640
交换下意见而已
about how you are in the sack.

375
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,750
-真有趣  -就是
- That's funny. - Yeah.

376
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,320
如果她不是在开玩笑呢
What if she wasn't kidding?

377
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,640
没关系
It doesn't matter.

378
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,790
哥可是前戏小王子
I'm the king of foreplay.

379
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,660
怎么样了
Hey, how'd it go?

380
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,630
你个2B
You're a putz.

381
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,700
你知道这是什么意思吗
You know what that means?

382
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,730
知道  你呢
Yeah. Do you?

383
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,650
你妈刚教我的
Your mother just taught it to me.

384
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,760
她觉得她在那家餐厅食物中毒了
She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli

385
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,840
想确认下我是否没事
and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.

386
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,920
那你有事吗
And are you?

387
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,540
有  因为我跟个2B订婚了
No, because I'm engaged to a putz.

388
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,810
你让我误信她心脏病发是因为我
You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.

389
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,950
那是基于现有证据嘛
Well, based on the available evid--

390
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,510
闭嘴
Shut up!

391
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,470
你妈说我是个好女孩
She said I'm a wonderful girl

392
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,670
能娶到我是你的福气
and that you're lucky to have me.

393
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,490
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

394
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,610
厕所
To the toilet!

395
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,150
你有意见啊
Is that okay with you?!

396
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,940
是我的错觉
Is it just me,

397
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,030
还是她生气的时候  声音是特别性感啊
or does she sound sexy when she's angry?

398
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,730
高山精灵
Mountain Elf.

399
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,210
这精灵不是高山的  是现成的
He takes the elf from off the shelf.

400
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,290
地狱猎犬
Hell Hounds.

401
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,380
地狱猎犬啊  谁把撒旦的狗放出来了
Hell Hounds-- who let the Satanic dogs out?

402
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,240
是谁  谁  谁
Who? Who-who?

403
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,310
神勇巨蟒
Colossal Serpent.

404
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,870
我裤裆里面也有条神勇的巨蟒
I got a colossal serpent right here.

405
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,080
你非得这样吗
Must you?

406
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,440
抱歉  我只是想让你高兴点
Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up.

如果硬要省略掉
If you skip the part about being

412
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,250
你因为接触到致命疾病
under a two-week quarantine

413
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,740
而被隔离两周这件事
because you were exposed to a deadly disease,

414
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,290
我们甘拜下风
absolutely.
