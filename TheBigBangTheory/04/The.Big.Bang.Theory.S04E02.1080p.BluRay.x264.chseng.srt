1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,170
在干嘛呢
Whatcha doin' there?

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,100
研究抓哔哔鸟的新方法吗
Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,240
你这个幽默暗指我是大笨狼怀尔吗
The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,210
没错
Yes.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,780
而板上画的捕鸟设备
And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,750
最终只会适得其反  让我受伤吗
that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,020
没错
Yes.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,760
我正在做的
What I'm doing here

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,100
是想计算出我的死亡时间
is trying to determine when I'm going to die.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,600
很多人都在做这方面的研究
A lot of people are working on that research.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,340
那这些是什么
So what is all this?

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,240
我家人的寿命长短
My family history factoring in longevity

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,640
疾病倾向等信息
propensity for disease, et cetera.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,710
有意思
Interesting.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,910
卡尔叔叔的死因是KBB
Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,950
KBB是什么
What's "KBB"?

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,280
被獾所杀
"Killed by badger."

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,020
怎么回事
How's that?

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,090
那是感恩节
It was Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,720
卡尔叔叔说"我觉得有只獾住在咱家烟囱里"
Uncle Carl said, "I think there's a badger living in our chimney. "

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,630
"把手电筒给我"
"Hand me that flashlight."

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,860
那是他对我们说的最后几句话
Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,260
我觉得
I don't think you need

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,270
你没必要担心被獾所杀会遗传
to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,740
不对
Not true.

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,440
战斗或逃跑的本能受基因控制
The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,440
他没选择逃跑  反而赤手空拳
Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,110
跟鼬类动物中强壮的一员战斗
against a brawny member of the weasel family.

29
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,350
谁能肯定我没遗传这种有缺陷的基因
Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,920
你反正可以找只獾来验证的
You can always get a badger and find out.

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,560
说实在的
But seriously

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,190
即使我忽略卡尔叔叔这个因素
even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,660
我最多也只剩60年寿命
at best I have 60 years left.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,260
还有那么长啊
That long, huh?

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,930
60年我只能活到这里
60 only takes me to here.

36
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,100
我要活到这里
I need to get to here.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,970
那里有什么
What's there?

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,740
据预计奇点最早出现的时间
The earliest estimate of the singularity

39
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,970
人们能将自己的意识
when man will be able to transfer his consciousness

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,680
转移进机器而获得永生
into machines and achieve immortality.

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,110
这么说  你不高兴自己会错失
So, you're upset about missing out

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,820
变成某种怪异的有自我意识的机器人的机会
on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,850
就差这么一点啊
By this much.

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,120
真可惜  你要吃鸡蛋吗
Tough break.  You want eggs?

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,890
你不明白  莱纳德
You don't get it, Leonard.

46
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,490
我会错过很多东西
I'm going to miss so much.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,030
统一场论  冷聚变  还有章狗
the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus.

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,630
章狗是什么
What's a dogapus?

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,840
狗和章鱼的杂交动物
The hybrid dog and octopus.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,810
人类在水下的忠实朋友
Man's underwater best friend.

51
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,380
有人研究这个吗
Is somebody working on that?

52
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,640
我打算过研究的
I was going to.

53
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,320
我想把它作为我三百岁的生日礼物
I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,380
等等  你讨厌狗
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,720
章狗玩接球时能接八个球
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls.

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,390
没有人能讨厌这个
No one can hate that.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
生活大爆炸第四季第二集

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
我们欠你多少钱
What do we owe you?

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,670
一共是28.17美元
It came to $28.17.

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,800
每人就六美元吧
Let's say six bucks apiece.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,570
给你
Here you go.

62
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,800
谢谢
Thank you.

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,940
干嘛
What?

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,240
算了  我请了
Never mind. I got it.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,780
你要我给钱啊
Oh, you wanted me to pay.

66
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,010
-不用了  -不不不  你是对的
- It's no big deal. - No, no, no, no. You're right.

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,450
我们已经分手了  我应该自己付钱
We're not going out anymore; I should pay for myself.

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,420
笑什么
What?

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,720
他说"如果他有女人身子"
He said, "If he had woman parts

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,330
"他后半辈子就不愁吃了"
"he'd eat for free the rest of his life"

71
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,500
是啊  可你也没办法跟自己说话了
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself.

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,130
我现金有点紧张啊
I'm a little low on cash.

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,240
-你有多少  -没有
- How much you got?  - Nothing.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,770
你不带钱怎么出门啊
How can you walk around with no money?

75
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,410
我漂亮  别人请客
I'm cute. I get by.

76
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,170
没事  欠着吧
It's okay, you can owe me.

77
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,410
-谢谢  -谢尔顿  六美元
- Thank you.  - Sheldon, six bucks.

78
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,180
不了  谢谢  我今晚不吃披萨
No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.

79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,280
可今天是星期四
But it's Thursday.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,920
星期四是披萨之夜
Thursday's pizza night.

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,020
对我来说不是
Not for me.

82
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,090
现在改成十字花科蔬菜之夜了
Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

83
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,460
今晚的特选  小包菜
Tonight's selection: Brussels sprouts.

84
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,590
真的吗
Really?

85
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,290
你要改谢尔顿日程表
You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?

86
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,400
-这只是个小小的代价  -为啥
- It's a small price to pay. - For what?

87
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,930
-不  别问啊  -对不起
- No, no, don't ask. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,270
为了把我的寿命延长到能把意识
In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness

89
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,870
转移到人造大脑上  我要改变饮食
with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,140
等等  人造大脑是机器人之类的吧
Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?

91
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,110
没错
Correct.

92
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,610
这么说你想把自己变成某种机器人
So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?

93
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,810
本质上是这样
Essentially, yes.

94
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,080
我想问个问题
Okay, here's my question.

95
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,510
你不是已经变成机器人了吗
Didn't you already do that?

96
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,490
虽然我受宠若惊  可惜还没有
Flattering, but sadly, no.

97
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,960
我还打算开始一种运动养生法
I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen

98
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,390
加强我的心血管系统
designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system.

99
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,660
也就是慢跑
AKA jogging.

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,230
等等  亲爱的  你以前跑过步吗
Wait. Honey, have you ever run before?

101
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,530
当然跑过
Certainly.

102
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,740
我被恶霸  狗和暴走的鸡追过
I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens...

103
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,370
还有个锲而不舍执意要给我做
and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher

104
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,640
脊柱侧弯测试的体育老师
determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.

105
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,750
你说得对  佩妮经常跑步
You're right. Penny jogs.

106
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,320
你们可以一起跑的
Maybe you guys can run together.

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,680
这主意太棒了
That's an excellent idea.

108
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,420
如果我们边跑边聊
Yeah, if we chat

109
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,660
就会感觉时间流逝得更快了
it will create the illusion of time going faster.

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
绝对不可能
No, it won't.

111
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,900
他怎么知道我跑步的
Um, how does he know I jog?

112
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,170
因为他在车里用高倍望远镜尾行你
Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.

113
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,040
我的天呐  这太猥琐了
Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

114
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,700
我就说嘛
I know!

115
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,410
他说他要坚持发扬下去
And he says he's not gonna stop.

116
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,050
那找心理医生解决怎么和女人说话的问题啊
Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.

117
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,160
什么玩意儿
What the hell?

118
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,500
怎么了
What's the matter?

119
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,540
疼痛以我的肚脐为起点
I have pain radiating from my navel

120
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,370
延伸到我的右下腹
to my lower right abdomen.

121
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,470
我感到恶心和发热
I'm nauseated and feverish.

122
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,340
我觉得我得霍乱了
I believe I may have cholera.

123
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,680
帕萨迪纳才没霍乱呢
There's no cholera in Pasadena.

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,780
就跟去年夏天帕萨迪纳也没有疟疾一样
Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

125
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,150
好吧  如果那不是霍乱
Well, if it's not cholera

126
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,050
根据搜索结果
then based on a quick Internet search

127
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,920
由相似度递减排列的其他解释分别是
the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood

128
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,790
先天性巨结肠  肉毒杆菌中毒  一条30英尺长的绦虫
are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

129
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,700
或者是不小心摄入菊花
or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.

130
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,500
你什么时候会不小心摄入菊花的
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,100
这是包括了梦游
It's part of an unlikely scenario

132
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,740
和24小时营业的花店
that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart

133
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,970
以及不靠谱的经营者的不可能场景
with a less-than- vigilant proprietor.

134
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,410
噢  老天  我的肚子
Oh, Lord, my belly!

135
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,280
你切除过阑尾吗
Ever had your appendix out?

136
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,510
没有
I haven't.

137
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,980
我想来着  但谁有那时间啊
I've been meaning to, but who has the time?

138
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,550
我送你去医院吧
Let's get you to the hospital.

139
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,750
于是乎就此了结
So this is how it ends...

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,890
真是无比残酷的讽刺
with cruel irony.

141
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,190
正当我保证要保护爱惜自己的身体之时
Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body

142
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,730
我被自己的阑尾所背叛  就一退化的器官
I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ.

143
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,200
你知道阑尾原本的作用是什么吗  莱纳德
Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,300
不知道
No.

145
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,170
我知道  而知道太多的却灭亡而你却能继续活下去
I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on.

146
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,340
结局很出乎意料  是不是
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

147
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,050
噢  天呐  我感觉要爆炸了
Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!

148
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,120
还有种可能
On the other hand

149
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,850
也许都是小包菜的错
it might have been the Brussels sprouts.

150
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,390
晚安您呐
Good night.

151
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,690
晚安
Good night.

152
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,290
阑尾炎
Appendicitis.

153
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,000
自己紧张个甚啊
What a nervous Nelly.

154
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,370
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny! Penny! Penny!

155
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,270
来啦  来啦
Coming, coming.

156
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,210
嘿  跑鞋不错嘛
Hey, nice knees.

157
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,280
谢谢
Thank you.

158
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,310
这是我娘的
They're my mother's.

159
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,850
闪电侠T恤是什么意思
Oh. And the Flash shirt is what?

160
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,850
你要跑的飞快吗
Because, what, you're gonna run really fast?

161
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,580
不是  穿闪电侠衫是因为今天是星期五
No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday

162
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,050
但要是真能有效就更好了
but it's nice when things work out.

163
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,150
-你的心率监测器在哪儿  -没有
- Where's your heart rate monitor?  - I don't have one.

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
-计步器呢  -没有
- What about your pedometer?  - Don't have one.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,460
那你鞋子里有传感器连接到iPod吗
Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?

166
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,390
-没  -那你干嘛呢
- Uh, no.  - What do you do

167
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,830
就出去像兔子一样随便蹦蹦跳跳一下吗
You just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?

168
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,440
不  也就跑到饿了  然后买个熊爪包吃
No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.

169
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,170
为什么要这么做
Why are you doing that?

170
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,810
在跑步前最好拉伸下肌肉
It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.

171
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,080
好吧
All right.

172
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,280
先来摸个脚趾
Let's start with a toe touch.

173
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,320
你来做一个
Okay, you do it.

174
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,290
我正做着呢
I <i>am</i> doing it.

175
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,990
哇哦  不错
Oh. Wow. Good job.

176
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,930
你能做这个么
Can you do this?

177
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,700
我们永远也不会知道的
We'll never know.

178
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,000
好吧  那边跑边热身吧
Okay, let's just warm up on the run.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
-好的  -那出发吧
- Okay.  - Okay, let's go.

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,670
我最近一直在读生物力学的书
I've been reading up on biomechanics.

181
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,510
我认为你会惊讶于我的...
I think you'll be surprised at my...

182
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,050
我的天呐  你还好吗
Oh, my God, are you okay?

183
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,180
应该吧
I think so.

184
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,520
-我来拉你一把吧  -谢谢
- Oh, let me help you up.  - Thank you.

185
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,290
噢  谢尔顿
Oh, Sheldon!

186
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,290
如果这能让你觉得好些的话
If it makes you feel any better

187
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,790
星期四不再是十字花科蔬菜之夜了
Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,430
这是我的咖喱鸡
Here's my chicken curry.

189
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,830
霍华德的鲜虾菜饭
Howard, your shrimp biryani.

190
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,930
-谢谢您  -菠菜奶豆腐  是佩妮的
- Thank you, sir.  - Palak paneer, that's Penny.

191
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,670
-谢谢  -而拉杰·库萨帕里的
- Thanks.  - And for Rajesh Koothrappali

192
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,840
家乡发明出这些美味佳肴的人
from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate

193
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,240
一个大份的麦乐鸡
one large order of chicken McNuggets.

194
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,610
-我的这份多少钱  -12刀
- Hey, what's my share?  - Uh... 12 bucks.

195
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,150
-我能周五付工资以后再还你吗  -没问题
- Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?  - Sure.

196
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,880
我欠你多少了
What am I up to now?

197
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,220
呃  算上印度菜  比萨
Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza

198
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,250
泰国菜  一箱油
the Thai food, the tank of gas

199
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,920
冷冻酸奶
the frozen yogurt

200
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,230
外带你的房租  嗯...
and your rent, uh...

201
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,090
一千四百多一点吧
a little over $1,400.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,330
又怎么了
What now?

203
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,300
他只是表示膜拜
He's just expressing his admiration that

204
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,100
你不用献身也能蹭吃蹭喝
you don't even have to put out to get free stuff.

205
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,010
我这不是蹭  我会还钱的
It's not free-- I'm gonna pay him back.

206
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,180
给我停
Shut up!

207
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,580
谢尔顿  你不来吗
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

208
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,150
就来
Coming!

209
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,740
你们好  伙计们
Greetings, friends.

210
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,810
你好  你个天知道是什么的鬼东西
Greetings, whatever the hell you are.

211
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,210
我是一个移动虚拟化身设备
I am a mobile virtual presence device.

212
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,810
鉴于近来发生的事
Recent events

213
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,250
我意识到我的肉身太过脆弱
have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile

214
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,750
承受不了大千世界的种种
to endure the vicissitudes of the world.

215
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,220
因此  在我能够
Until such time as I am able

216
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,650
转移意识之前
to transfer my consciousness

217
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,490
我的肉身将保存在一个安全地点
I shall remain in a secure location

218
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,830
并借此方式同外界联系
and interact with the world in this manner.

219
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,030
没搞错吧  你就想问这个--
Really? That's your question--

220
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,560
他啥时搞来的那个斜坡
when did he put a ramp in?

221
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
你占了我的专属座位
You're in my spot.

222
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,730
可能一开始感觉会有点怪
This may seem a little odd at first

223
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,370
但时间久了  你们就会渐渐习惯
but over time, you'll grow accustomed

224
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,670
和这样的我打交道
to dealing with me in this configuration.

225
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,570
是咩  说实话  我觉得没什么不同
Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.

226
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,770
谢谢
Thank you.

227
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,980
这也是我的目的
That's what I was going for.

228
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,680
那个  莱纳德  明天我们去上班时
Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work

229
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,650
你得腾出点时间来
you'll need to allow some extra time

230
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,450
把我搬下楼梯
to get me down the stairs.

231
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,120
为了让你省力  我会分解成四个部分
For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.

232
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,160
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

233
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,330
我要去找你谈谈
I'm coming to talk to you.

234
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,630
你不知道我在哪儿
You don't know where I am.

235
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,670
我的肉身现被安置在
My physical body is safely ensconced

236
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,370
一个安全保密的场所
in a secure, undisclosed location.

237
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,970
你不就在你卧室里么
You're in your bedroom.

238
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,570
不  我不在
No, I'm not.

239
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,910
我都能听到你说话的声音从卧室传出来
I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.

240
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,240
不  你听不到
No, you can't.

241
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,580
你给我等着
Wait.

242
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,950
回来
Come back.

243
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,220
站住
Halt.

244
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,620
未经授权人员禁止入内
Authorized personnel only!

245
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,090
好吧  你们两个变态
So, either one of you weirdos

246
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,090
有谁想买我的内衣么  只要一千四百块哦
want to buy my underwear? Only 1,400 bucks.

247
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,600
谢尔顿  这太荒唐了
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

248
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,170
我在你后面
I'm behind you.

249
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,370
和我说话时请看着我
Please look at me when you're talking to me.

250
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,870
我正看着你呢
I am looking at you.

251
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,170
不  你没有
No, you're not.

252
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,640
无视床上的那个人
Pay no attention to that man in the bed.

253
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,680
你不能以这种方式存在于这世上
You cannot exist as a virtual presence.

254
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,550
这儿不行  工作时就更不行了
Not here and certainly not at work.

255
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,420
我的娘咧
Oh, good God.

256
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,020
你知不知道  我这年纪的人
At my age, do you know

257
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,850
统计数字上最可能怎么死吗
how I'm statistically most likely to die?

258
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,120
被你室友做掉吗
At the hands of your roommate?

259
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,690
死于一场意外
An accident.

260
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,160
我就准备弄成像是一场意外
That's how I'm going to make it look.

261
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,800
在我将自己的智慧
Until I can transfer my intellect

262
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,100
转移到一个更持久的容器内之前
to a more durable container

263
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,870
我的肉身将被安全安置在我的床上
my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.

264
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,940
随你  但别指望我会帮你
Fine, but don't expect my help.

265
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,500
你必须帮我  室友协议里写了
You have to help-- it's in the roommate agreement.

266
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,010
不  才没有
No, it's not.

267
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,340
74条C款
Section 74.C.

268
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,850
两人间若有人成了机器人
The various obligations and duties of the parties

269
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,480
另一人所应尽的各项义务和责任
in the event one of them becomes a robot.

270
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,150
让我一头撞死好了
I'll be damned.

271
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,330
这种感觉太赞了
This is delightful.

272
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,330
哼哼
Uh-huh.

273
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,600
不用担心死于车祸
It's much easier to enjoy

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,610
这样在上班路中欣赏美景
the picturesque route we travel to work

275
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,840
就更加怡然自得了
when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death.

276
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,110
提醒我下
Refresh my memory.

277
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,710
我干嘛不直接把你塞进后备箱呢
Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?

278
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,680
因为我先抢了前排座位  记得不
Because I called shotgun. Remember?

279
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,350
好吧
Right.

280
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,690
你看着压力很大
You seem tense.

281
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,390
这样会不会感到放松
Perhaps this will relax you.

282
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,540
我不想听音乐  谢尔顿
I don't want to listen to music, Sheldon.

283
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,140
好吧
Very well.

284
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,050
真不明白你为什么不喜欢这样
I don't understand why you're not enjoying this.

285
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,580
你和增强功能的我  一起在车里
Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities

286
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,120
这就好比霹雳游侠嘛
we're like Knight Rider.
同名电视剧  男主角和他的人工智能车

287
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,920
那里面的车可不是括约肌吱吱响的废柴
Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.

288
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,860
你居然嘲笑括约肌
You mock the sphincter

289
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,630
括约肌可是人体的一组肌肉
but the sphincter is a class of muscle

290
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,100
没有的话人类没法存活的哦
without which human beings couldn't survive.

291
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,440
人体内共有超过50种
There are over 50 different sphincters

292
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,110
不同的括约肌
in the human body.

293
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,470
你能叫出多少
How many can you name?

294
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,380
我错了  这就是一霹雳游侠  没说的
I was wrong-- this is exactly like Knight Rider.

295
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,510
你大概会对另一个游戏感兴趣
Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.

296
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,980
没兴趣
No.

297
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,580
这张照片  是在1911年
This is a photograph of the 1911

299
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,490
我PS了几处不该存在的东西
Using Photoshop, I've introduced a few anachronisms.

300
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,860
看看你能不能找出所有24处
See if you can spot all 24.

301
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,360
我先给你第一个提示好了
I'll give you the first one.

302
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,670
居里夫人不该带着电子表
Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch.

303
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,040
你继续吧
And go.

304
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,470
益智游戏节目《冒险》的主题曲

305
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,070
够了  拜拜
That's it. Bye-bye.

306
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,040
吓死你
Bazinga.

307
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,450
我有更高权限的开关
I have an override switch.

308
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,050
我差点被你害死了
I almost died!

309
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,550
而我仍安然无恙地坐在床上
And I'm safe and sound in bed.

310
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,720
现在再看谁是疯子
Who's crazy now?

311
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,420
我还是会说你
I'm still going to go with you.

312
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,430
你好  霍斯金斯教授
Hello, Professor Hoskins.

313

很高兴见到你  敏迪

早上好[日语]  中村博士
And <i>konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamura.</i>

315
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,610
很遗憾那帮瑞典佬推翻了你的理论
Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory.

316
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,650
莱纳德  我的门
Leonard, my door.

317
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,880
你的门怎么了
What about it?

318
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,720
乖  给哥开个门
Be a lamb and open it for me.

319
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,660
为嘛  有啥问题吗
Why? What's the problem?

320
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,470
你以为你难住我了  对吗
You think you have me stymied, don't you?

321
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,940
没有啊  我觉得难住你的是门把手
No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.

322
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,510
哦  看啊  莱纳德和R2-D-Bag[代指《星战》里的R2-D2机器人]
Oh, look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.
《星战》里R2-D2机器人  这里D-bag是douchebag[蠢货]的缩写

323
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,010
这笑话是我想出来的  我昨晚给你讲的
That's my joke. I told it last night.

324
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,280
你不能随便剽窃好吧
You can't just use it.

325

He's a lamb.

328
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
你不乖
You're not.

329
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,460
我好乖哦
I'm a lamb.

330

在享受同伴感情的同时

339
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,890
你干嘛还要作自我介绍啊
Why are you introducing yourself?

340
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,060
不管怎么样  我宁愿
I'd rather people not know

341

大家都不知道我跟你们之前有任何联系

你能介绍一下今晚有什么特色菜吗

谢尔顿  我不为你服务

你还没给我倒水呢

346
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,040
因为你不在这里
Because you're not here.

347
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,470
你这是对远程遥控人员的歧视

358
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,440
我得去和他聊聊

359
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
你当然得去了
Of course you must.

360
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,540
这条街上还有家橄榄园[意大利连锁餐馆]
You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street.

361
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,110
你们有空应该去尝尝

362
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,080
打扰了  沃兹尼亚克先生

才第15啊

Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3

374
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,250
它确实算个一流的小成就
it was a pretty nifty little achievement.

375
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,520
多谢  "一流"这个词让我受宠若惊
Thanks, we were shooting for "nifty."

376
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,390
如果你能把它带过来的话
You know, if you had it here

377
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,990
我可以在上面签个名

别走开  等我15到30分钟
Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes

379

390
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,300
你想过来当面对我唱吗
Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
