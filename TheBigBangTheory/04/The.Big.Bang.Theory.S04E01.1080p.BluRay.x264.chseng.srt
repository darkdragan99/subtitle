1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,840
现在是宫保鸡丁
And now the kung pao chicken.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,880
很顺利啊
Smooth.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,380
最后
And finally,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,670
我的木须肉
my moo shu pork.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,690
给力!
Whoo-hoo!

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,210
菜上齐了  先生们
Oh, there you have it, gentlemen.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,510
整整一桌由机器人上的晚餐
Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,030
而且只花了28分钟
And it only took 28 minutes.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,960
是很不错  但我们必须要小心
Impressive, but we must be cautious.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,930
-为什么  -今天机器人来上中国菜
- Why?  - Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,050
明天就穿越回过去
Tomorrow, it travels back in time

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,250
谋杀莎拉·康纳
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,980
我可不觉得这会发生  谢尔顿
I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,560
确实没发生过
No one ever does.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
所以才会发生
That's why it happens.

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,000
嘿  晚餐到了吗
Hey. Is the food here?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,450
这是什么
Ooh. What's that?

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,580
亲爱的女士
That, dear lady,

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,950
这叫沃罗威茨程控手
is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand,

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,720
专为维修国际空间站
designed for extravehicular repairs

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,070
而设计的延伸臂
on the International Space Station.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,560
好酷啊
Ah, cool.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
叫我把酱油递给你
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,040
空间站里有人用机械手打酱油吗
Oh, does that come up much on the space station?

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,310
通常会是亚裔或犹太航天员
Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,520
-好吧  给我酱油  -就来
- All right. Pass the soy sauce.  - Coming up.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,370
工作如何
So how's work?

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,810
还不赖吧
Oh, it's not bad.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,930
有点饿了
Kind of hungry.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,570
我们都饿
Yeah, we all are.

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,390
等等就好
Just wait.

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,330
佩妮  你有想过
You realize, Penny, that the technology

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,230
这机械臂所蕴含的科技会在某天
that went into this arm will one day make

34
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,890
让你这种没有能力的服务员下岗么
unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,140
真的吗
Really?

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,730
他们会造往你汉堡上吐口水的机器人吗
They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?

37
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,270
我以为你跟她分手了
I thought you broke up with her.

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,820
她为什么在这儿
Why is she here?

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,940
好了  搞定
Okay, here we go.

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,470
传递酱油
Passing the soy sauce.

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,930
手抬起来
Put out your hand.

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,430
真不可思议
That's amazing.

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,290
我可不会说不可思议
I wouldn't say amazing.

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,210
最多不过是比《乡村熊狂欢节》里的
At best, it's a modest leap forward
迪士尼乐园一个用机械动物表演的秀

45
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,580
使用的最基本的科技前进了一小步而已
from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,790
嘿  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon?

47
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,060
怎么了
Yes?

48
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,280
和平吗
Peace?

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,690
不  才不是
No, not peace.

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,340
等着
Hang on.

51
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,830
生活大爆炸第四季第一集

52
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,130
美国航天局知道你用这个作餐巾纸架吗
Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
开玩笑  他们以为这个还在JPL的保险柜里呢
You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.
JPL: 喷气推进实验室  美国顶尖机器人实验室

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,240
你偷的
You stole it?

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,340
借的
Borrowed.

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,220
关键在表现得像把自己的东西带到车上
The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.

57
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,890
不好意思
Excuse me.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,230
艾米正在干洗店
Amy's at the dry cleaners,

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,830
然后想到一个很有趣的双关语
and she's made a very amusing pun.

60
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,560
"我不喜欢全氯乙烯
"I don't care for perchloroethylene,

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,700
不喜欢乙二醇醚"
and I don't like glycol ether."

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,660
懂了吗
Get it?

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,060
不喜欢乙二醇醚
She doesn't like glycol ether.

64
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,090
听起来就像"亦"
Sounds like "either."

65
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,840
"噗-哈-哈"
"L-O-L."

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,310
-艾米是谁  -他女朋友
- Who's Amy?  - His girlfriend.

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,450
-谢尔顿有女朋友吗  -她不是我女朋友
- Sheldon has a girlfriend?  - She's not my girlfriend.

68
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,280
-这事儿多久了  -四个月
- How long has this been going on?  - Four months.

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,450
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

70
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,910
你是在说  过去的四个月里
Are you telling me, for the past four months

71
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,450
我一直在问你  "有新鲜事吗"
I have been asking you, "What's new?"

72
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,530
你居然从来没想过说
and you never thought to go with,

73
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,170
"谢尔顿有女朋友"吗
"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

74
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,700
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,790
啊  等等等等
Ah... d-d-d-d...

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,240
他们怎么认识的
How did they meet?

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,700
拉杰和我把谢尔顿的信息发到交友网站上
Raj and I entered Sheldon's information on a dating site,

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,780
网站速配了艾米·菲拉·福勒
and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.

79
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,380
天哪  谢尔顿和艾米
Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.

80
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,250
或者像我们所说"谢米"
Or, as we call them, "Shamy."

81
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,990
谢米
Shamy.

82
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,880
我必须好好八一八谢米了
I am so digging the Shamy.

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,540
好吧  各单位注意
All right, everyone pay attention.

84
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,390
没错  我是有个朋友叫艾米·菲拉·福勒
Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler.

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,800
没错  她是女性
Yes, she is female.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,100
没错  我们每天交流
Yes, we communicate on a daily basis,

87
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,810
但是  她不是我女朋友
but no, she is not my girlfriend.

88
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,570
好吧  那你们交流都说什么
Okay, well, what do you communicate about?

89
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,040
我的物理工作和她的神经生物学工作
Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology,

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,050
最新话题是论我们生个孩子的可能性
and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
谢谢
Thank you.

92
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,050
等等  要孩子
Wait a minute-- a child?

93
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,130
你从没见过这女的
You never see this girl.

94
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,270
只有电邮短信和推特联系
You just e-mail and text and Twitter.

95
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,460
然后现在就考虑要孩子了
Now you're considering having a baby?

96
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,920
艾米指出通过我俩的结合
Amy pointed out that between the two of us,

97
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,000
我们的基因将会有机会
our genetic material has the potential

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,880
制造出前所未有的
of producing the first in a line

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,670
智力超群  仁慈善良的君主
of intellectually superior, benign overlords

100
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,600
带领人类走向光明未来
to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,570
我猜想未来的历史学家
I'm guessing that future historians

102
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,770
将会谴责我们不趁这机会杀了谢尔顿
will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,030
好吧  我有个问题
Okay, I have a question.

104
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,960
请说  佩妮
Yes, Penny.

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,010
你不喜欢别人碰你
You don't even like people touching you.

106
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,840
你们怎么做爱呢
How are you going to have sex?

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,940
我们干嘛要做爱
Why on earth would we have sex?

108
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,050
亲爱的  你的私处开始发育的时候
Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you?

109
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,460
你妈妈没跟你谈过吗
You know, when your private parts started growing?

110
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,700
我很清楚人类繁殖的方式
I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce,

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,760
既脏乱又不卫生
Which is messy, unsanitary,

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,920
而且跟你做了三年邻居
And based on living next to you for three years,

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,480
听了太多不必要又响亮的呼唤神
Involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,130
天呐
Oh, God.

115
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,830
对  就是这句
Yes, exactly.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,060
因此  如果艾米和我
Consequently, if Amy and I choose

117
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,700
选择让一个新生命降临
to bring new life into this world,

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,540
我们会让生育专家
It will be accomplished clinically,

119
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,670
在实验室用培养皿受精
with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes.

120
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,700
这倒提醒我
Which reminds me--

121
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,730
你不仅屁股大  而且头脑简单  精力充沛
you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigor.

122
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,680
你的子宫可以代孕吗
Is your womb available for rental?

123
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,920
还想深入八一八谢米恋吗
Still digging the Shamy?

124
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,120
谢尔顿
Look, Sheldon,

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,200
先别急着选孕育科
before you race off to the fertility clinic,

126
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,410
你也可以考虑
you might want to think about--

127
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,490
老天  怎么说呢
uh, gee, I don't know--

128
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,280
切实地花点时间陪她
maybe actually spending some time with her.

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
-你是说约会  -没错
- You mean dating?  - Yeah.

130
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,860
-我不能和艾米约会  -为什么
- I can't date Amy.  - Why not?

131
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,830
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

132
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,980
不要把它当成和女朋友约会
Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend.

133
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,300
把它当成
Think of it as, uh...

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,930
了解你孩子的未来妈妈
Getting to know the future mother of your child.

135
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,260
我还真没想到
I hadn't considered that.

136
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,900
她将来应该会接触我们的后代
I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny.

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,480
你觉得通过短信息
And you don't think I can achieve

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,710
我无法达到必要的亲密吗
the required intimacy via text messaging?

139
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,020
应该不能
Probably not.

140
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,850
看来电话公司一直在骗我
It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.

141
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,420
佩妮
Penny.

142
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,710
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny.

143
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,390
你应该知道我站在门的另一边
You do realize I stand on the other side of the door

144
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,210
等你敲完三次门吧
waiting for you to finish knocking three times.

145
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,820
我知道  我能从门缝看到脚的影子
I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
重点是敲三次很浪费时间
Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,110
如果你想找个
If you're looking for an example

148
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,820
浪费时间的例子
of a waste of time, I would refer you

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,050
我们现在的话题就很浪费时间
to the conversation we're having right now.

150
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,280
你有事吗
What do you want?

151
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,940
我决定了接受你的建议
I've decided to take your advice and have arranged

152
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,190
还安排了跟艾米约会
to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.

153
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,230
那太好了
Oh, that's great.

154
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,080
-玩得开心  -等等
- Have fun.  - Wait.

155
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,960
你要载我去
You have to drive me.

156
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,080
-什么  -你知道我不开车
- What?  - You know I don't drive.

157
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,920
-去问莱纳德  -问了
- Well, go ask Leonard.  - I did.

158
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,250
他说  我复述  问问佩妮
He said-- and I quote-- "Ask Penny.

159
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,440
那是她的可笑主意
It was her cockamamy idea."

160
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,030
莱纳德说"可笑"?
Leonard said "cockamamy"?

161
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,940
好吧  那是我说的
Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

162
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,630
在基督教家庭长大
Having been raised in a Christian household,

163
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,270
我实在不习惯他的用语
I'm uncomfortable with the language he used.

164
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,940
老实说
And to be honest,

165
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,620
其实我也不喜欢"可笑"这个词
I'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamy."

166
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,740
好吧  什么时候约会
Okay, fine. When's the date?

167
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,410
-现在  -现在?
- Now.  - Now?

168
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,190
快点  我们要迟到了
Hurry. We're going to be late.

169
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,010
谢尔顿  你有没有想过
Sheldon, did it ever occur to you

170
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,200
我可能有别的事要忙吗
that I might have other plans?

171
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,170
对不起
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,380
你有别的事忙吗
Do you have other plans?

173
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,420
倒是没有  不过
Well, no, not per se, but...

174
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,460
这么说这个话题
So this conversation is as pointless

175
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,000
跟你的敲门独白一样没意义咯
as your door-knocking soliloquy?

176
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,560
我去拿我的可笑钥匙
Let me get my... cockamamy keys.

177
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,740
天呐  太爽了
Oh, God, that feels so good.

178
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,150
对  就是那里
Yeah, that's the spot.

179
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,910
宝贝儿
Oh, baby.

180
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,830
霍华德  吃饭啦
Howard, dinner's ready!

181
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,740
我一会再吃
I'll eat later.

182
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,470
现在很忙
I'm busy!

183
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,370
爽啊
Oh, yeah.

184
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,410
就跟人手一样
Just like a real hand.

185
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,230
谢谢你载我去
Thank you for driving me.

186
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,750
不客气
You're welcome.

187
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,750
但我希望你不穿人字拖
I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops.

188
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,970
穿人字拖开车很危险
It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.

189
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,580
-谢尔顿  -对不起
- Sheldon.  - Sorry.

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,790
我只是不想成为另一个人字拖的受害者
I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.

191
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,180
我能问个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

192
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,080
鉴于你的社区大学学历
Given your community college education,

193
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,360
我鼓励你尽量多问
I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.

194
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,430
好  我的问题是
Yeah. Well, my question is--

195
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,090
其实我很清楚答案
and I'm pretty sure I know the answer--

196
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,000
这是你第一次约会吗
Is this your first date?

197
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,060
那得看情况
That depends.

198
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,140
跟我妹在国庆日
Does square-dancing with my sister

199
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,780
青年敬耶稣方块舞会上
at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown

200
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,320
跳舞算吗
count as a date?

201
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,590
不算
No.

202
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,500
那这是我第一次约会
Then, this is my first date.

203
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,610
那有几件事
Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things

204
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,480
你应该要知道
you should probably know.

205
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,400
我有一个硕士学位和两个博士学位
I have a master's degree and two doctorates.

206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,470
我应该知道的事  我都知道
The things I should know, I do know.

207
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,910
我的意思是  我比你更清楚约会
My point is, I know more about dating than you,

208
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,590
而且如果你真有你认为的那么聪明
and if you were as smart as you think you are,

209
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,220
你就会听我的话
you would listen to me.

210
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,100
如果你是约会专家  那怎么我今晚有约会
If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,310
而你只能当我的司机呢
and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?

212
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,760
说得好
Fair point.

213
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,880
《水行侠》的有些问题我想不明白
You know, there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman.

214
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,250
-什么  -他去哪便便
- Yeah?  - Where does he poop?

215
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,950
什么
What?

216
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,610
亚特兰蒂斯的马桶长什么样
What would a toilet look like in Atlantis?

217
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,540
你怎么冲掉呢
How would you flush it?

218
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,420
就算你冲掉了  便便又能冲去哪呢
And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?

219
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,910
一会儿再讨论
Hold that thought.

220
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,660
喂  霍华德  怎么了
Hey, Howard. What's going on?

221
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,830
啥
What...

222
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,240
等等  霍华德  慢点说
Hold on. Howard, Howard, slow down.

223
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,820
机械手卡在你的什么上了
The robot hand is stuck on your what?

224
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,570
说出来肯定吓你一跳
You're not going to believe this.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,930
艾米  听谢尔顿说
So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me

226
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,080
你是一个神经...什么来着
you're a neuro... something-or-other.

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,030
是神经生物学家
Neurobiologist.

228
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,470
你车的"检查引擎"灯亮了
Your "check engine" light is on.

229
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,700
噢  不管它
Yeah, it's okay.

230
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,710
但如果灯亮了就说明...
But the light indicates...

231
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,070
不用费心了
Don't bother.

232
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,750
我已经浪费太多时间
I've wasted many an hour

233
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,420
攻击这座顽固的风车了
tilting at that particular windmill.

234
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,400
你用的什么香水吗
Uh, what is that scent you're wearing?

235
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,890
真好闻
It smells great.

236
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,880
去屑洗发水
Dandruff shampoo.

237
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,650
我头皮干燥
I have dry scalp.

238
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,610
你发质看着很好呀
Well, your hair looks very nice.

239
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,150
你是同性恋么
Are you a homosexual?

240
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,140
当然不  我只是赞美你而已
No, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.

241
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,690
要你是同性恋  赞美不听着更由衷吗
Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.

242
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,480
那啥  来点音乐怎样
Guys, how 'bout some music?

243
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,650
哦不  我可不想要
Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that.

244
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,290
艾米  你呢
Amy?

245
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,030
我也是  谢了
No, thank you.

246
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,320
好吧
Okay.

247
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,910
那就诡异地沉默着吧
Uncomfortable silence it is.

248
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,100
谢尔顿  你有没有告诉艾米
Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

249
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,900
你小时候在德州长大的经历
what it was like for you growing up in Texas?

250
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,250
没有
No.

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,570
哎  为什么不告诉她
Well, why don't you tell her?

252
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,390
好吧
All right.

253
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,510
痛苦得要死
It was hell.

254
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,360
艾米  有什么想法么
Any follow up, Amy?

255
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,030
没有
No.

256
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,440
我在内布拉斯加州长大
I myself grew up in Nebraska.

257
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,220
奥马哈郊外的一个小镇
Small town outside of Omaha.

258
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,370
很好的地方  大多是家庭农场  还有些制毒窝点
Nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.

259
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,100
不好意思  这样还不如诡异地沉默呢
I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?

260
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,120
我也不知道  不过是试着找点话题
I don't know. I was just trying something.

261
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,550
麻瓜一个[此处引用《哈利波特》里的说法]
Muggles.

262
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,770
你是滑倒摔进机械手里的吗
You slipped and fell into a robot hand?

263
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,110
对
Yes.

264
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,850
鸡鸡先着地
Penis first?

265
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,050
对  快帮我
Yes. Now, help me!

266
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,640
我本来想建议用润滑剂
I'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling

267
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,730
但我想其实你已经栽在润滑剂里了
you fell on some of that as well.

268
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,440
不好笑  莱纳德
Not funny, Leonard.

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,330
是吗  一个机械手卡在你小弟弟上
Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude.

270
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,220
这还不好笑吗  不信你问别人
That's funny, ask anyone.

271
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,890
拜托  趁我妈还没进来  快把这玩意弄掉
Plea-- before my mother walks in, get this off me!

272
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,930
唔  我看看
Okay, let's see.

273
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,820
别  别碰电脑
No, no! Don't touch.

274
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,880
程序暂停了
The program is paused.

275
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,210
那就重新启动呗
Well, then let's un-pause it.

276
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,480
别  导入错误的程序
No, no! I loaded the wrong program.

277
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,390
这玩意以为自己在外太空握着把螺丝刀呢
The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space.

278
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,080
要是程序继续  它就要开始扭了
If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.

279
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,690
好吧
A-All right.

280
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,340
这样如何
Um, how about this.

281
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,290
小熊维尼的脑袋卡在蜂蜜树上时
When-when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck

282
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,310
他的伙伴们就会上去拉住他
in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him

283
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,980
然后往外拔啊拔啊拔
and pulled and pulled.

284
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,260
你爱咋咋地
You do what you want,

285
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,900
我可不想碰其他男人的"蜂蜜树"
I'm not touching another man's honey tree.

286
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,360
好吧  不拔了
All right, uh, forget pulling.

287
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
那就找把电锯  直接锯掉
How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
啥  不准用电锯
What?! No saws!

289
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,950
一个包皮环切还不够吗
One circumcision was enough.

290
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,460
那乙快焊炬呢
How about an acetylene torch?

291
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,230
好吧  不敢相信我还要声明这些
Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud.

292
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,620
不准拔  不准用电锯和焊炬
No pulling, no saws, no torches.

293
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,230
那你要我们做啥
Well, then what do you want us to do?

294
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,630
霍华德  我做了饼干
Howard, I made cookies for you

295
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,090
给你和你的小伙伴
and your little friends!

296
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,560
好极了  老妈  多谢
That's great, Mom, thanks!

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,390
我送上来  再带点夏威夷宾治酒
I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!

298
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,770
别上来
Don't come up here!

299
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,000
干嘛  看不起你妈吗
Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
话是没错  但这不是关键
Yes, but that's not the point!

301
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,520
快帮帮忙
Get me out of here.

302
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,670
你有想法吗  拉杰
You have any ideas, Raj?

303
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,600
现在啊  我满脑子都是饼干和夏威夷宾治酒
Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

304
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,110
好吧  换个话题
Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation.

305
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,120
今晚是谢尔顿的盛大之夜啊
This is a big night for Sheldon.

306
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,290
是吧  谢尔顿
Right, Sheldon?

307
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,900
盛大
Big night?

308
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,340
冬至日的夜晚才叫大
The winter solstice is a big night.

309
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,020
在南加利福尼亚
It's over 14 hours

310
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,990
一共有整整14小时呢
in Southern California.

311
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,250
这句话仿得真有意思
That's an amusing factoid.

312
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,100
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,330
不
No, no.

314
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,040
我是说  今晚是谢尔顿第一次正式约会
My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date.

315
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,710
你们继续吧
Discuss.

316
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,120
真的吗
Is this true?

317
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,230
当然  在国庆日上的青年敬基督
Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus

318
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,050
方块舞会上的那次半乱伦约会不算
Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.

319
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,070
艾米  那你呢
So, um, Amy, what about you?

320
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,000
你约会过吗
Do you date much?

321
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
一年一次
Once a year.

322
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,330
我和我妈说好了
It's a deal I made with my mother

323
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,450
这样她就不唠叨这事
in exchange for her silence on the matter,

324
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,490
还可以偶尔用她的乔治·富曼烤架
as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill

325
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,340
锁住美味  没有脂肪
that seals in the flavor without the fat.

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,700
你呢  佩妮
How about you, Penny?

327
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,210
你约会过很多次吗
Do you go on many dates?

328
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,970
其实也没有很多次啦
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

329
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,320
有几个吧
A few.

330
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,000
这算啥表情
What's...?

331
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,780
你把约171个不同男人描述为"有几个"
Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as "A few."

332
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,230
什么
What...

333
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,330
你怎么算的171个
Where did you get 171 men?

334
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,950
简单的推断
Simple extrapolation.

335
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,790
我认识你的这三年来
In the three years that I've known you,

336
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,250
你有两年是单身
you were single for two.

337
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,210
在那两年里  你跟17名追求者约会过
During that time, I saw 17 different suitors.

338
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,510
往前倒推的话  请纠正如果观察有误
If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias

339
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,040
并假设你初次约会年龄为15岁
and postulate an initial dating age of 15

340
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,840
等等  等等
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

341
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,530
我才不是15岁开始约会的
I did not start dating at 15.

342
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,680
抱歉  十六岁
I'm sorry. Sixteen?

343
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
十四
Fourteen.

344
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,740
我的错
My mistake.

345
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,420
假设钟形曲线的左半部分在目前达到峰值
Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present,

346
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,720
那就是说总数为193人
that would bring the total up to 193 men.

347
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,850
正负8人
Plus or minus eight men.

348
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,340
太厉害了
Remarkable.

349
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,060
你跟这些人都有过性关系吗
Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?

350
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,980
没有
No.

351
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,900
这个数字要算的话也相当简单
Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.

352
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,400
基于我早上在她公寓门口尴尬邂逅
Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had

353
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,840
陌生过夜男士的数量
with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning,

354
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,090
加上遇见她穿着前晚衣服
plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes

355
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,250
早上回家的次数
she wore the night before...

356
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,950
好了  谢尔顿  我们都明白你意思了
Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.

357
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,550
那就是193人
So we multiply 193--

358
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,290
减去她失去童贞之前的21人
minus 21 men before the loss of virginity--

359
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,460
即172人乘以0.18
so 172 times 0.18 gives us...

360
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,190
30.96位性伴侣
30.96 sexual partners.

361
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,320
约等于31
Let's round that up to 31.

362
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,450
好了  谢尔顿  这根本不对
Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

363
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,560
跟实际数字大相径庭
That is not even close to the real number.

364
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,520
这里给我来杯酒
I'm gonna need a drink over here.

365
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,700
这真有趣
This is very interesting.

366
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
个人的文化认知是非常主观的
Cultural perceptions are subjective.

367
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,010
佩妮  在你看来  你是荡妇吗
Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?

368
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,240
不  不是
No! No!

369
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,550
不是
No.

370
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,490
我们还是自顾自用餐好了  好吗
Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?

371
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,540
确实是个有趣的话题
This is an interesting topic.

372
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,100
你有多少次性经验
How many sexual encounters have you had?

373
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,230
这要看志愿参加科学实验
Does volunteering for a scientific experiment

374
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,140
通过电子系统刺激人脑中的
in which orgasm was achieved by electronically

375
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,770
愉悦中心区获得性高潮也算吗
stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count?

376
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,970
我想应该算的
I should think so.

377
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,050
那就是128次
Then 128.

378
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,590
好的  进来吧
Okay, come on.

379
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,080
就快到了
Almost there.

380
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,570
-别用力拉  -我没在拉
- Don't tug. - No tugging.

381
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,750
下回你自己搞定
Next time, take your own advice.

382
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,980
打扰下  能否帮帮我们
Excuse me, could you help us out?

383
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,900
天哪天哪天哪
My, my, my.

384
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,050
这怎么回事
What do we have here?

385
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,830
我不小心滑倒了
I slipped and fell.

386
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,670
嗯  这我们经常碰到
Yeah, we get that a lot.

387
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,470
这是什么
What is this?

388
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,990
是机器人的手臂
It's a robot arm.

389
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,140
那机器人的其他部分呢
Where's the rest of the robot?

390
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,320
我就造了手臂
I only built the arm.

391
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,470
因为你就需要这个  是吗
'Cause that's all you needed, right?

392
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,280
能先帮我解决这再说吗
Can you please just help me?!

393
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,160
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

394
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,010
稍安勿躁
Hang on, stay calm.

395
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,690
请派护理员送轮椅来
I need an orderly with a wheelchair.

396
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,520
有被机械手钳住小弟弟的来看急诊
I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.

397
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,840
你讲话就不能含蓄点
You think you could be a little more discreet?

398
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,410
抱歉  "机械手钳住小弟弟"这种情况未设代码
I'm sorry,we don't have a code for "Robot hand grasping a man's penis."

399
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,670
它为何还连到电脑上
Why is it hooked up to a computer?

400
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,410
-就是通过电脑控制机械手的  -但电脑死机了
- Uh, it's what controls the arm. - But it's frozen.

401
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,880
你试过关机重启吗
Did you try turning it off and back on again?

402
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,860
不  这事远比这复杂得多
No, you see, it's more complicated than that.

403
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,190
别  住手
No, wait!

404
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,380
小熊维尼终于从蜂蜜树中脱困
Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.

405
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,020
现在能让我们吃饼干和夏威夷宾治了吧
Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?

406
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,400
你说得对
You were right.

407
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,040
这个夜晚确实收获颇丰
This was a very productive evening.

408
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,730
今晚我见识到了艾米·菲拉·福勒全新的一面
I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

409
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,870
我没跟31个男人有过性关系
I did not have sex with 31 guys.

410
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,740
我很乐意验算下  但数字不会骗人的
I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny.

411
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,620
不管怎样  现在我和艾米已共度了"美好时光"
In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together,

412
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,880
我就更有信心
I feel much more confident

413
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,730
继续将我俩关系发展到下一阶段了
proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.

414
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,870
什么阶段
And that is?

415
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,950
利用试管授精和代孕
Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus

416
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,760
生下我们的后代向人类献礼
to gift humanity with our progeny.

417
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,540
你还在计划这个
You're still on that?

418
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,270
人世无常  人类难道不该有所安慰
In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

419
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,730
好吧  这样吧
Okay, you know what?

420
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,240
我再换种方式跟你说
I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way.

421
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,120
谢尔顿  如果你想用培养皿造出你跟艾米的孩子
Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

422
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,210
我一定会去告诉你的妈妈
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

423
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,450
这威胁不了我
That's no threat.

424
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,460
我妈一直都想抱孙子的
My mother's always wanted a grandchild.

425
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,650
真的  你那虔信基督再生的母亲
Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother

426
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,560
会想要一个非婚生的试管婴儿当她的孙子
wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?

427
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,730
诅咒你
Curses.

428
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,580
我要是早点想出这招
If I'd thought of that in the first place,

429
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,920
今晚也不用受这份罪了
I could've saved myself this whole night.

430
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,710
现在还不算晚
Well, it's not that late.

431
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,300
你还是可以出去寻找32号性伴侣
You could still go out and look for number 32.

432
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
晚安
Good night.

433
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,300
霍华德  怎么了
Hey, Howard, what's up?

434
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,940
我决定不要孩子了
I've decided not to procreate.

435
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,430
好的  很好
Yeah, yeah, great.

436
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,280
霍华德  慢点说
Howard, uh, slow down.

437
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,020
什么叫悲剧重演了
What do you mean it happened again?
