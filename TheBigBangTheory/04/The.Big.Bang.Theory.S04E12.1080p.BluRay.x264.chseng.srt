1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,060
老妈  淡定
Ma, Ma, calm down.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,010
听我说
Listen to me.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,210
我知道上面说着用鼠标点击
I know it says click with the mouse,

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,160
但在笔记本电脑上  触控板就相当于鼠标了
but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,660
现在  把你的手指放上去
Now, put your finger on it.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,640
无所谓用哪根手指
Doesn't matter which finger.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,510
明智的选择
Good choice.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,680
现在把指针移到电子邮件图标上
Now move it down to your e-mail icon.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,040
对  就是那个小信封图标
Yeah, the little envelope.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,090
什么叫"它长什么样"
What do you mean, "What does it look like?"

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,120
它当然长个信封样!
It looks like an envelope!

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,600
行啊  你要是不喜欢电脑
Fine, you don't like the computer,

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,870
那就别用了
don't use it!

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,190
行啊  我们可以换个沙拉搅拌机  再见
Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,690
这就是你一直后悔买的那个光明节礼物吧
That's a Hanukkah present you're regretting, huh?
光明节:犹太民族最隆重的节日

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,290
我不能说所有无法掌握当代技术的
I won't say that all senior citizens

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,740
老年人就应该被当众鞭策一番
who can't master technology should be publicly flogged,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,810
但倘若我们拿一两位作为案例
but if we made an example of one or two,

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,600
或许能更好的鞭策他人努力学习呢
it might give the others incentive to try harder.

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,020
我有个好主意
I had a great idea.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,070
我们总会被迫停下工作
You know how we're always having

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,400
去解某些微分方程式吧
to stop and solve differential equations,

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,070
比如你做傅里叶分析的时候
like when you're doing Fourier analysis,

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,050
或是用到薛定谔方程的时候
or using the Schr dinger equation?

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,890
霍华德用不到那个  他只不过是个工程师
Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,930
我一直在想其实我们可以写个小程序
I was thinking, we could write a little app

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,490
通过使用手写识别技术
that would use handwriting recognition,

28
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,840
然后通过一个符号运算引擎来计算
and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,310
这样  只要你使用你的智能手机
You just use your smartphone,

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,620
把你的方程式拍出来后就迎刃而解了
take a picture of the equation and bam!

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,780
你们知道什么应用程序算牛吗  能制造放屁声的程序
You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,220
知道吗  莱纳德
You know, Leonard,

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,200
那的确是个可行的主意
that's actually a valid idea.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,030
真的不错哦
Very good.

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,990
你的口吻能否别弄得像是"我是一只刚学会
Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,330
如何上厕所的猫"似的
who learned how to use the toilet?

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
不行
No.

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,600
两项成就都让人感到啧啧称奇
The two achievements are equally surprising

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,950
同样令人钦佩
and equally admirable,

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,970
但如果要选的话
though if pressed,

41
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,640
我不得不说那只猫的成就更胜一筹
I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,670
我还是拯救你于水火之中
I'll save you the pain and nervousness

43
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,400
给你一个你期待已久的答案吧
of waiting for the answer.

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,860
我同意参与你的计划  恭喜你
I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.

45
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,360
我的荣幸啊
Oh, yay for me.

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,370
你们怎么说
What about you guys?

47
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,450
我不敢保证什么
I can't promise anything,

48
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,920
但有人就用这种东西赚到过钱呢
but people do make money off stuff like this.

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,830
能赚点外快也是不错的选择
A few extra bucks would be nice.

50
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,980
我终于能从我妈家搬出去了
I could finally move out of my mother's house.

51
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,860
你搬到哪去呢
Where would you go?

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,760
我一直梦想着能在车库上面
I always dreamed about

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,970
搭造起属于自己的小天地
building a little place of my own over the garage

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,400
如果我挣到更多的钱  我就能从工作中抽身
You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,090
带着美女来一趟潜艇之旅了
and give pretty girls submarine rides.

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,820
那是什么玩意
What's that?

57
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,950
某种诡异的性爱方式吗
Some weird sex thing?

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,130
不是啊
No.

59
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,380
就是你带着美女坐在你的
You take pretty girls underwater

60
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,150
私人潜艇里  让她们欣赏鱼儿
in your private submarine, and you show them fish.

61
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,170
为什么所有事到你这都要龌龊一下
Why does everything have to be dirty with you?

62
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,160
我想我们可以在晚上一起做这个
I was thinking we could work on this at night,

63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,660
也许经过几周的努力后
and then maybe in a couple of weeks,

64
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,510
就能有我们自己的应用程序贩售了
we'll have ourselves an app to sell.

65
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,020
我们这听起来像是在做生意啊
Sounds like we're in business.

66
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,120
我认为我们应该拍一张  留住这精彩的瞬间
I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
-好啊  -哦
- Yeah. - Oh!

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,250
你们说  这是不是我99美分花的最值的一次
Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?

69
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,530
生活大爆炸第四季第十二集

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,130
我查过应用商店了
I checked the App Store.
应用商店:苹果公司为应用程序设计的下载平台

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,050
还没人做过
No one is doing

72
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,640
手写识别解微分方程的应用程序呢
handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,980
天呐  你小声点
Oh, dear Lord, shush.

74
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,010
为什么
What?

75
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,690
你好不容易能有个好点子  莱纳德
You have so few good ideas, Leonard.

76
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,980
你打算就这么轻易地把它
And you're just going to spill the beans

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,350
当着一个外人的面泄露出去吗
in front of an outsider?

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,390
说谁呢  我吗
Who, me?

79
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,530
谢尔顿  我不觉得佩妮
Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,820
多在乎这个基于手写识别技术的微分...
about handwriting-recognition based differential...

81
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,470
*夜晚的星星大而亮呀*
*The stars at night are big and bright*

82
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,920
*深深地埋藏在德州的中央*
*Deep in the heart of Texas*

83
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,540
她不会来盗取我们的点子
She's not going to steal our idea.

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,110
-什么点子  -我们要写一个应用程序...
- What idea? - We're gonna write an application...

85
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,810
*草原的星空宽而高呀*
*The prairie sky is wide and high*

86
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,850
*深深地埋藏在...*
*Deep in the heart...*

87
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,450
行了  别唱了
Okay, stop, stop!

88
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,970
*德州的中央*
*Of Texas*

89
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,900
无论你们的秘密是什么
Whatever your secret is,

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,110
我确信它必定无聊至极  所以我不会有兴趣的
I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.

91
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,310
一点也不无聊啊
It's not boring at all.

92
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,620
你想想  在高阶数学中
You see, in higher order mathematics,

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,470
一定会有
there are certain sets

94
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,450
-联立方程组  它们有时...  -无聊
- of equations that... - Bored.

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,240
满意了吗
Satisfied?

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,110
恐怕很难
Hardly.

97
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,190
试想一下这个不太可能却又非常真实的情节吧
Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario.

98
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,160
一位年轻女子只身来到大都市
A young woman alone in the big city.

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,390
她荒谬的演员梦想
Her ridiculous dream

100
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,240
欺骗了她  从而深深地打击了她
of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.

101
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,850
拜托  你停一下好吗
Hey, wait a minute.

102
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,560
等等  我们看看他的后续如何
Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,300
然后现实打击了她
Then it hits her.

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,990
她如何才能生存下去呢
How is she going to survive?

105
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,390
因为她胸无大志且身无长物
I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills.

106
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,940
直到有一天
And then one day,

107
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,220
她遇到了一群天才们
she meets a group of geniuses

108
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,320
以及天才们的朋友霍华德
and their friend Howard.

109
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,850
我...
Hey, I...

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,790
你也等等  我们看看他的后续如何
Hang on. Let's see where he's going.

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,860
她与这帮人交朋友  然后伺机等候
She befriends them, and then lies in wait

112
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,260
直到这帮人有了一个可销售的点子
until they reveal a marketable idea,

113
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,510
于是她盗取了点子  卖给了出价最高的人
which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.

114
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,650
-这也太扯了  -哦  是吗
- That is ridiculous. - Oh, is it?

115
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,260
那你倒是给我们个合理的解释
Let's see you come up with an explanation

116
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,880
为何这个女人一直跟我们厮混在一起
as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
太棒了  你们知道吗
Oh, great. You know what?

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
我已经从你们这蹭到晚饭了
I've already mooched dinner off you guys.

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,920
所以我不需要再听这个点子了
I don't need to listen to this.

120
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,440
这就是你要的答案  免费食物
There's your answer-- free food.

121
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,420
好吧  我已经自作主张
All right, I've taken the liberty

122
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,050
起草了这些工作流程图
of drafting these workflow charts

123
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,150
这里列出了我们形形色色的职务以及
which outline our various duties and the path we will follow

124
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,560
开发这独创程序过程中需遵照的事项
as we develop our ground-breaking new app.

125
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,550
为何我负责的是电话服务
Hey, why am I in charge of phone support?

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,050
貌似有点种族主义
Seems a bit racist.

127
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,830
一个操着印度口音的客服
A customer service representative

128
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,190
能够给客人们留下一种
with an Indian accent will create the impression

129
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,890
我们这是跨国公司  使用海外客服中心的印象
we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centers.

130
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,000
哦
Oh.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
很聪明
Very clever.

132
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
但还是有种族色彩
But still racist.

133
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,220
提醒下  你叫史蒂夫来自威奇托[美国城市]
Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.

134
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,540
为什么我被列为你的行政助理
Why am I listed as your executive assistant?

135
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,220
因为"秘书"这个词已经变得不大光彩了
Because the word "Secretary" has fallen into disrepute.

136
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,870
提醒下  我妈妈的生日快到了
FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up.

137
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,390
我需要你来帮我挑选个礼物
I'm going to need you to pick up a present.

138
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,140
好吧  我们需要暂时先停一下了
Okay, we need to stop for a minute.

139
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,190
莱纳德  拜托  我们可以在休憩时再谈
Leonard, please, we can talk during our break.

140
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,460
这个午夜马上就有事情要做了
We have one coming up at midnight.

141
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
我们需要小吃
We'll need snacks.

142
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,230
谢尔顿  这个并不是你负责的
Sheldon, you're not in charge.

143
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,740
这是我的点子  我才是负责的
It's my idea. I'm in charge.

144
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,880
当然是你负责啊
Oh, of course you are.

145
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,250
快看看上面的组织机构吧
Look at the organizational chart.

146
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,300
你被清楚地列为了奠基人
You're clearly listed as founder.

147
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,910
是啊  同时你被列为了首席执行官
Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer,

148
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,450
首席财务官和首席运营官
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

149
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,130
你还少说了首席科技官
You missed Chief Science Officer,

150
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,540
董事局主席以及秘密圣诞委员会首脑
Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.

151
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,720
好了
Okay.

152
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,830
你现在就需要搞明白这件事
You need to get clear on this right now.

153
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,700
我才是这个计划的决策人
I am in charge of this project.

154
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,860
哦哦  莱纳德想取代谢尔顿成为"书呆子"界的领袖喽
Ooh. Leonard's going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

155
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,950
好吧  好吧  我不打算跟你争执下去了
All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you.

156
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,400
谢尔顿·库珀如果不团队协作也一事无成
Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player.

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,040
霍夫斯塔德博士  一切由你指挥
Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.

158
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,310
谢谢
Thank you.

159
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,750
我认为我们可以先从用户界面开始讨论
I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.

160
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,560
哦天呐  我们失败定了
Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

161
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,760
那么这个按钮
So this button here

162
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,850
能让你扫描一个新方程
will allow you to scan a new equation,

163
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,530
而你按这边的按钮
but over here, you can press this,

164
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,320
就能替换新的系数
and just substitute new values for the coefficients.

165
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,050
不错哎  头儿
Good one, boss.

166
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
啥
What?

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,370
这个图例
This diagram.

168
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,920
你以为您是想讲个开场笑话
I assume you were opening with a joke.

169
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,440
毫无疑问鼓舞了我这个小员工的团队精神
It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps.

170
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,170
这不是玩笑  就是这么设计
It's not a joke. It's the real design.

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,140
这样的话  能让我稍微修改27处
In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks

172
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,440
让这玩意儿看着不那么丢人吗
to make it slightly less embarrassing?

173
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,540
谢尔顿  我觉得这个能成
Sheldon, I think this will work.

174
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,200
就按我说的做先
Let's just try it my way.

175
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,530
不好意思
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

176
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,520
我以为你希望你的属下
I assumed that you wanted

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,550
能畅所欲言  直言进谏
candid truth-telling from your employees,

178
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,120
而我现在意识到  你不过是喜欢
but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering

179
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,300
盲目奉承  沾沾自喜的应声虫
of complacent yes-men.

180
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,210
说完了吗
Are you done?

181
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,820
听你的  头儿
If you say so, boss.

182
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,020
好  按下这个键
So right now, this button-press event

183
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,980
就能调用一个虚拟程序...
is just triggering a dummy procedure call...

184
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,400
应用程序叫这名儿怎样
How about this for the app name?

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
出奇-好用-微分-方程-相关
The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,310
优化-计算器
Differential Optimized Numerator.

187
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,930
首字母连起来就是"谢尔顿"
So it spells "Sheldon."

188
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,090
是吗
Does it?

189
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,150
好巧啊
A happy accident.

190
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,070
现在不急着起名  霍华德  来吧
We're not doing names now. Howard?

191
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,470
我也说了  现在只是个虚拟程序
Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure,

192
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,920
但最终会进入...
but eventually, it will drop us into...

193
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,840
好吧  如果我们先不起名
All right, fine. If we're not going to give it a name,

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,640
好歹起个秘密代号吧
can we at least give it a secret code designation?

195
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,360
-不要  -听我说完
- No. - Hear me out.

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,630
原子弹计划的代号是曼哈顿计划
The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project.

197
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,280
Win95最早的代号是芝加哥计划
Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago.

198
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,750
而咱的应用程序  我低调建议就叫顿尔谢计划好了
For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.

199
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,260
不过是"谢尔顿"倒过来而已
That's just "Sheldon" Backwards.

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,620
又是个愉快的巧合啊
Another happy accident.

201
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,190
我们现在不浪费时间起名字
We're not wasting time with names right now.

202
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,540
我懂了
I see.

203
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,120
能公开讨论下这个决议吗
Is that decision open for discussion?

204
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,460
不
No.

205
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,590
能公开讨论下为什么不公开讨论吗
Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?

206
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,900
不
No.

207
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,420
再说一遍
Again,

208
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,760
现在这只是个虚拟程序
right now it's just a dummy procedure,

209
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,260
但最终会进入...
but eventually, it will drop us into...

210
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,810
我要对现在的领导人发起不信任投票
I call for a vote of no confidence

211
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,510
并且要求立即更换领导人
and an immediate change in leadership.

212
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,620
谢尔顿  快住口
Sheldon, stop it.

213
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,250
在人类活动过程中  有必要缓解
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary

214
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,080
三位有能力的科学家的合作关系
to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together...

215
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,070
-够了  谢尔顿  -好吧  直接开始投票吧
- That's enough, Sheldon. - All right, let's get right to the vote.

216
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,710
现在请所有反对莱纳德
Show of hands-- all those opposed

217
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,170
和他的专制帝国的人  举手
to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,080
够了  你被炒了
Okay, that's it, you're fired.

219
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,120
真的吗
Really?

220
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,110
为什么
Why?

221
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,390
因为你没法和人合作
Because you're impossible to work with.

222
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,830
我明白了
I see.

223
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,210
能公开讨论下吗
And is that open for discussion?

224
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,650
你在做什么
What are you doing?

225
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,720
早上好  大懒虫
Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

226
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,200
我想你会很高兴看到
I think you'll be pleased

227
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,900
昨晚精灵们的辛勤劳动成果
with what the elves were up to last night.

228
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,500
我不是炒了你么
I fired you.

229
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,490
我知道  我现在是个合同工
Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.

230
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,090
不  你啥都不是
No, you are now nothing.

231
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,460
你和这项目没有一毛钱关系了
You have no connection to this project whatsoever.

232
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,450
但我做了改进
But I made it better.

233
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,400
我不要你做改进  我要按我自己的来
I don't want it better. I want it my way.

234
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,540
这话真是意味深长  是吧
Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?

235
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,580
好吧  我想我还是去穿公车裤吧
All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.

236
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,370
公车裤是什么玩意
What the hell are bus pants?

237
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,880
就是穿在普通裤子外面的裤子
They are pants one wears over one's regular pants

238
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,290
因为你要坐在公车上
when one sits on bus seats

239
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,570
别人坐过的椅子上
that other people have previously sat on.

240
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,930
不过也许你是企业里
But perhaps from your lofty heights

241
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,060
高高在上的领导  恐怕不会理解
atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch

242
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,760
身为普通人的辛酸苦辣
with the struggles of the common man.

243
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,290
听着  我还是很乐意开车送你去上班
Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work.

244
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,750
在这点上没有改变
Nothing's changed in that regard.

245
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,310
我们还是室友  还是朋友
We're still roommates, we're still friends.

246
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,210
但你却把我  你最好的朋友
Except you identified me, your best friend,

247
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,740
当成一块坏死的肉
as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed

248
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,140
从组织上割下来再扔掉
from the organism and tossed away.

249
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,040
你这有严重拿破仑情结的小个子
The desperate act of a little man

250
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,560
还真是穷凶极恶
with a big Napoleon complex.

251
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,080
老子告诉你
You know what?

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,100
速度穿你的公交裤去吧
Go put on your bus pants.

253
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,500
昨天晚上  我做了个梦
Mm. Last night, I had a dream

254
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,440
我们因为这应用程序发了大财
we got so rich from the app,

255
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,600
我俩买了两幢相邻的别墅
you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions.

256
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,950
但是...
But...

257
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,140
中间有条秘密隧道
there was a secret tunnel

258
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,750
从你的前庭连到我的后院
connecting your front yard to my back yard.

259
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,420
你觉得这是啥意思
What do you think that means?

260
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,970
意思是我们玩完手球后  我在家洗澡
It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.

261
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,110
早上好  霍华德好友
Good morning, Friend Howard.

262
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,380
拉杰好友
Friend Raj.

263
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,280
两位先生在喝饮料啊
I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages.

264
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,100
也许这些能让它们喝起来更美味
Perhaps they would taste better out of these.

265
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,540
"世上最伟大的天文物理学家"
"World's Greatest Astrophysicist"?

266
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,350
不用谢我  你应得的
Don't thank me. You earned it.

267
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,260
"霍华德·沃罗威茨"
"Howard Wolowitz."

268
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,910
为啥不是"世上最伟大的工程师"
Why not "World's Greatest Engineer"?

269
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,760
不好意思
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,630
我在做标签的时候是这么打过
I typed that into the label maker,

271
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,880
但实在按不下确认键
but I just couldn't press enter.

272
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
现在谈正事吧
Now down to business.

273
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,050
你们何不抛弃莱纳德
What would it take for you to abandon Leonard

274
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,110
加入竞争对手  我的公司
and join me in a rival company?

275
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,180
要是这两个马克杯还不够
Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient,

276
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,530
不管怎样  欢迎你们入伙
in which case, welcome aboard.

277
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,720
我们不会抛弃莱纳德
We're not quitting on Leonard.

278
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,730
我明白  你们的忠诚值得赞扬
I understand. Your loyalty is admirable.

279
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,700
但如果我再增加筹码呢
But what if I were to up the ante?

280
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,820
你在说什么鬼
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,800
字母组合钥匙链
Monogrammed key chains

282
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,070
还配有内置激光
with a built-in laser pointer.

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,560
还是不吗
No?

284
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,150
那印有我们大学
How about can cozies

285
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,270
吉祥物的保温罩呢
emblazoned with our university mascot?

286
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,330
冲啊  海狸
Go, Beavers.

287
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,660
我马上回来
I'll be back.

288
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,610
好  我们试下这个
Okay, let's try this one.

289
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,970
"球面汉克尔函数"
"Spherical Hankel function."

290
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,480
稍等
Hold on.

291
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,810
有了
That's it!

292
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,870
中了
Eureka!

293
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,440
喂  我们不是说好"中了"的时候
Hey, we agreed when it was "Eureka" Time,

294
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,630
要一起说的吗
we were all gonna say it together.

295
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,780
好吧  那再一起说一次好了
Fine. Let's say it together.

296
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,850
不了  这个时机已经过了
No. The moment has passed.

297
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,960
你们好  先生们
Greetings, gentlemen.

298
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,740
你们的小项目咋样了
How goes your little project?

299
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,380
你是指  "莱沃帕里"计划吗
You mean, "Project Lenwoloppali"?

300
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,120
是你们名字的组合啊
Ah, a combination of all your names.

301
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,330
真聪明
Very clever.

302
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,660
为啥不是"库萨纳德威茨"呢
I assume "Koothranardowitz" Was taken?

303
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,420
我们在扫描方程  效果还不错
We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.

304
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,920
好吧  你们继续努力吧
Oh, well then, by all means, carry on.

305
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,930
我不想妨碍你们的进程
I wouldn't want to impede your progress.

306
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,380
霍华德  你解决了安装时间的问题了吗
Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?

307
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,010
没有  这有点难应付
No. It's a little tricky.

308
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,290
我准备查下图书馆的查询系统...
I'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dyn...

309
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,420
你在搞什么
What are you doing?!

310
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,040
在演奏特雷门琴
Playing the theremin.

311
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,580
不  我是说  你拿特雷门琴在搞什么
No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?

312
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,030
演奏啊
Playing it.

313
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,270
我第一次听到星际迷航原声主题乐时
I've loved the theremin from the first moment

314
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,350
就爱上了特雷门琴了
I heard the original Star Trek theme.

315
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,680
我实在是不忍心
And it's been killing me

316
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,780
把它一直扔在柜子里积灰
that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.

317
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,600
谢尔顿  我们在工作
Sheldon! We're working here!

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,620
没关系
That's all right.

319
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,770
我在演奏特雷门琴时几乎听不到你们说话
I can barely hear you over my theremin.

320
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,660
这真有点不讲道理
Well, that was a little uncalled for.

321
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,000
不  这他妈的太讲道理了 我们需要安静
No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,140
就是说你们的项目比我的重要咯
So, your project is more important than mine?

323
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,300
如果你的项目就是给我捣蛋  那就是
Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.

324
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,960
别拐弯抹角的  莱纳德
Don't beat around the bush, Leonard.

325
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,880
你要是容不下我
If you don't want me here,

326
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,960
说出来  我会走人的
just say the word, and I'll leave.

327
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,190
稍微拐弯抹角一点也没什么嘛
Could have beaten around the bush a little.

328
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,210
*没人知晓*
Nobody knows

329
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,000
*我曾经见的离乱*
The trouble I've seen

330
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,100
*没人理解  我的悲伤*
Nobody knows my sorrow ?

331
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,100
你干嘛呢
What you doing?

332
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,370
联络你的母星吗
Trying to contact your home planet?

333
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,240
我在练习特雷门琴
I'm practicing my theremin.

334
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,250
*没人知晓*
Nobody knows

335
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,100
*我曾经见的离乱*
The trouble I've seen

336
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,430
*荣耀啊  哈利路亚*
Glory, hallelujah.

337
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,160
什么事儿惹你不开心了吗  谢尔顿
Something got you down, there, Sheldon?

338
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,920
莱纳德把我从家轰出来了
Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment.

339
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,610
还有应用程序小组
And his app team.

340
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,280
亲爱的  真可怜
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

341
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,910
他今天还不肯开车带我上班
He wouldn't drive me to work today.

342
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,810
搞得我不得不穿公交裤
I had to wear my bus pants.

343
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,230
-是这样吗  -嗯
- Is that so? - Yes.

344
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,510
现在裤子还粘糊糊的
And they're still sticky.

345
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,790
估计得扔掉了
Probably going to have to throw them away.

346
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,420
听着  你才不需要莱纳德和他的程序
Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app.

347
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,110
你可以跟我研究出来一个嘛
You can make one with me.

348
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,770
和你吗
With you?

349
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,450
说真的  我有个超赞的点子
Seriously, I have a great idea for one.

350
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,850
比你搬来洛杉矶
Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles

351
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,730
成为一个名演员的点子还赞吗
and become a famous actress?

352
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,430
行了  听着
Okay, look...

353
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,110
当你看到某人脚上的鞋子  让你很感冒
when you see someone wearing shoes you like,

354
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,730
你就拍一张照片
you just snap a picture of them,

355
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,130
然后用这个程序直接在网上
and the app goes on the Internet

356
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,530
查到哪里有卖
to find out where you can buy them.

357
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,040
这就是你应用程序的点子
That's your app idea?

358
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,940
你不感兴趣吗
Well, you don't like it?

359
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,800
我刚才没这么说  不过  我确实不感兴趣
I didn't say that. But no, I don't.

360
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,550
为什么
Why not?

361
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,290
佩妮  让我从何说起啊
Oh, Penny, where do I begin?

362
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,450
超越了这个点子弱智程度的
The simple-mindedness of your idea

363
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,100
只有愚蠢的消费者至上主义和俗不可耐
is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.

364
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,890
莱纳德不要跟你合作
And Leonard didn't want to work with you?

365
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,580
真"稀奇"啊
Imagine that.

366
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,110
我知道  确实匪夷所思啊
I know, it's baffling.

367
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,700
*没人知晓*
Nobody knows

368
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,490
*我曾经见的离乱*
The trouble I've seen...

369
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,550
谢尔顿  我要冲可可喝
Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa.

370
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,850
你要喝吗
Do you want some?

371
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,010
你用什么冲  牛奶还是水
Do you make it with milk or water?

372
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,690
-牛奶  -货真价实的可可吗
- Milk. - Real cocoa?

373
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,540
包装上是这么说的
That's what it says on the packet.

374
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,830
你有那种小棉花糖吗
Do you have those little marshmallows?

375
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,700
没有  抱歉
No, sorry.

376
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,660
看来还真是配啊
Well, I suppose it's appropriate.

377
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,450
什么意思
What does that mean?

378
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,630
倒霉日喝烂饮料
A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.

379
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,140
喂  看这个
Hey, look at this.

380
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,110
学校里已经有二十个人登记了
20 people from the university have already signed up

381
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,710
咱的内测版
for our private beta.

382
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,990
我就说嘛
I'm telling you,

383
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,100
莱沃帕里微分方程扫描仪
the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner

384
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,800
满足了实际需求  咱要火了
meets a real need. We've got a hit.

385
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,700
你们觉得咱该定个什么价位
What do you think we should sell it for?

386
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,890
这个嘛  基于我们的潜在市场
Well, based on the fact that our potential market

387
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,890
大约七八十人的事实
is about 70 or 80 guys,

388
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,960
而你又想赚个潜水艇
and you want a submarine,

389
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,210
我的意见是一单一百万刀
I'd say about a million dollars a pop.

390
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,430
不如咱出个精简版  卖五十万
Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million?

391
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,370
你懂吗  可以赚个口碑的说
You know, get the word of mouth going.

392
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,180
嗨  抱歉打扰了
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys,

393
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,760
你们得过来把你家谢尔顿领走
but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.

394
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,010
他怎么会在你家
What's he doing in your apartment?

395
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,550
他一人在大厅闷闷不乐  我就把他带回家了
Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over.

396
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,730
现在我肠子都悔青了
Now I regret it.

397
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,460
他干啥让你后...废话一句  当我没说
Why do you regret... Uh, never mind, stupid question.

398
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,290
就不能带他一起玩儿到睡觉吗
Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?

399
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,810
我们这不是玩儿
We're not playing.

400
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,050
这是正事
This is real work.

401
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,970
我们就要成为百-富翁咯
We're going to be hundred-aires.

402
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,080
成吧  要是我能让他道歉并且保证他乖呢
Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?

403
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,060
这样的话  我们的研究组可以接受他
Then I guess we would let him back on the app team,

404
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,470
他回来之后  你说不定能坐着你的飞天猪仔
and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour

405
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,170
在空中游览洛城
of L.A. on your flying pig.

406
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,720
好吧  等着啊
Okay. Wait right here.

407
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,890
跟你们说吧  要是我有天发达了
I'll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough,

408
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,960
我就想带这样的女孩
that's the kind of girl I want to take

409
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,900
来一次潜水艇之旅
on a submarine ride.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,750
而且没错  我是要龌龊一下
And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.

411
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,820
真的吗
Really?

412
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,290
莱纳德想让我回去吗
Leonard wants me back?

413
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,940
没错  他说你不在他们就群龙无首了
Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.

414
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,890
这还用说

415
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,520
那是
That's right.

416
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
你知道我准备干吗吗
You know what I'm going to do?

417
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,990
我准备就一直坐在这  由得他们去烦吧
I am going to sit here and just let them stew.

418
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,310
别  别  别
No, no, no. You know,

419
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,750
他们已经够受罪的了
they have suffered enough.

420
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,600
大家都够受罪的了
Everybody's suffered enough.

421
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,390
关键是  你得过去
The thing is, you're going to have to offer him

422
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,140
给他一个有面子的台阶下
a face-saving way out of this.

423
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,090
怎么给他台阶下
How?

424
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,180
道个歉呗
Say you're sorry.

425
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,380
不
Oh, no.

426
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,670
我亲爱的母亲玛丽·库珀太太可没教我撒谎
Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.

427
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,460
好吧
Okay. Um...

428
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,990
那这样好不好  你不是一直想要学
How about this? You know how you're always trying

429
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,530
挖苦人吗
to learn about sarcasm?

430
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,240
-没有  -没有吗
- No.  - No?

431
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,200
我刚刚那就是挖苦
I was being sarcastic.

432
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,750
真不错
Oh. Good for you.

433
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,140
所以你只需要过去
So all you have to do here is say

434
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,290
跟莱纳德道歉
you're sorry to Leonard,

435
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,520
但是语气要带着挖苦
but say it sarcastically.

436
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,240
当然
Of course.

437
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,290
在他听来  那是我在示好
He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences,

438
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,420
但实际上咱俩清楚
as opposed to the withering condemnation

439
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,550
那是赤裸裸的谴责
you and I will know it to be.

440
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,770
没错  没错  我就这个意思
Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan.

441
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,980
好了  走吧  咱们过去
All right. Come on. Let's go.

442
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,770
顺便说一句  谢谢你
Oh, by the way, thank you

443
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,490

444
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,140
不客气
Oh, you're welcome.

445
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,370
我的挖苦功夫真是越来越精湛了
Boy, I'm getting good at this.

446
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,680
好吧  既然你归队了
Okay, now that you're back on the team,

448
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,330
在你开始之前  我想再次

449
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,630
为我之前的表现向你表示深刻的道歉

450
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,020
另外我很尊重并且钦佩你的领导

还能把他们转发给你的朋友们

455
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,650
或是直接通过应用程序把他们贴到Facebook上
or post them on Facebook right from the app.

456
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,850

463
