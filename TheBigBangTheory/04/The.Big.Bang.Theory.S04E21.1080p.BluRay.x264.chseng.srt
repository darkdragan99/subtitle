1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,900
莱纳德  你在洗澡吗
Leonard, are you in the shower?

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,040
我听不清  我在洗澡
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,170
我问你是不是在洗澡
I asked if you were in the shower,

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,140
现在没意义了
but that's moot now!

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,310
什么
What?

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,150
没意义  就是基于现况变得不重要的意思
Moot! Rendered unimportant by recent events!

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,720
我听不清  我在洗澡
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,520
我不能闲谈了
I have to skip the chitchat.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,790
紧急情况
Emergency.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,660
什么紧急情况
What kind of emergency?

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
自己算吧  32盎司香蕉冰沙
You get mathematical-- 32-ounce banana smoothie,

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,360
16盎司的膀胱
16-ounce bladder.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,930
你确定你要那么做吗
You might not want to do that.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,660
我确定
I assure you I do.

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,270
谢尔顿  我不是自己在这
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,240
什么
What?!

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,070
你好  谢尔顿
Hello, Sheldon.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,540
你在那干吗
What are you doing in there?

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,810
她不能在这
She can't be in here!

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,480
我们先来的  是你不能在这
We were in here first; you can't be in here.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,150
根据室友协议
According to the roommate agreement,

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,650
第九段  B分段
paragraph nine, subsection B,

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,380
"洗手间隐私权
"The right to bathroom privacy

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,650
在遇不可抗力时中止"
is suspended in the event of force majeure."

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,320
相信我  我现在正在经历
And believe me, I am experiencing

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,260
非常严重的不可抗力
a very majeure force.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,760
拜托  你等不了2分钟吗
Come on, you can't wait two minutes?

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,690
莱纳德  让这可怜的人尿吧
Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,840
佩妮  佩妮 佩妮
Penny? Penny? Penny?

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,210
干吗
What?

31
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,410
闪开  闪开  闪开
Move. Move. Move!

生活大爆炸第四季第二十一集

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,680
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,180
你正式被控
you are officially charged

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,510
违反2项室友协议
with two violations of the roommate agreement.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,780
你放弃宣读控告吗
Do you waive reading of the charges?

41
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,920
好吧  是
Yeah, fine.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,250
等等  不
Hang on. No.

43
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,760
我的委托人不放弃宣读控告
My client does not waive reading of the charges.

44
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,030
酷  我有律师了
Cool. I've got a lawyer.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,300
而且我还看过她的裸体
And I've seen her naked.

46
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,630
继续
Proceed.

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,270
很好
Very well.

48
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,440
"罪行一
"Count the first:

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,940
4月28日  左右
On or about the 28th day of April,

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,740
在紧急时刻  确切地说
the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought

51
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,240
比喻及其需要尿哗哗
在"明知我的牙都被水淹了"的情况下
deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency,

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
被告蓄意预谋拒绝我使用共用洗手间
to wit, my back teeth were floating.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,750
罪行二  被告超过约定的
Count the second: the accused exceeded

54
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,060
浴室占用量
the agreed upon occupancy of the shower,

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,730
确切地说  一个人  除非我们被
to wit, one, unless we are under attack

56
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,590
可溶于水的外星人攻击"
by water-soluble aliens."

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,760
我能看看室友协议吗
Can I see the roommate agreement?

58
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,300
它非常专业
Um, it's fairly technical.

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,200
我认为我能应付
I think I can handle it.

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,940
她们班的尖子生  剑桥大学
Top of her class, Cambridge University.

61
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,340
在三个国家有律师执业许可
Licensed to practice law in three countries

62
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,110
直接KO你
and your face.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
好吧  根据我的粗略阅读
All right, based on a cursory reading,

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,520
看起来你没什么获胜的几率  谢尔顿
it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,420
不可能  不可能
Do so, do so.

66
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,260
恐怕是的
Oh, I'm afraid not.

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,670
第七部分这里  紧急情况下
Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom

68
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,460
进入洗手间的权利  没有明确约定
in emergency situations, is not specific

69
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,700
什么是紧急情况
as to what constitutes an emergency.

70
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,930
这太荒唐了
Oh, that's ridiculous!

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,240
洗手间紧急情况不言自明
A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,310
是吗  如果莱纳德忘记修剪鼻毛
Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair,

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,710
他能在你洗澡的时候闯进去吗
could he barge in while you were showering?

74
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,210
不相干  莱纳德不剪鼻毛
Irrelevant. Leonard doesn't trimis nose hair.

75
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,820
他认为因为他很矮  所有没人能看得到
He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.

76
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,750
我的重点是  谢尔顿  法律准则是
My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is,

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,200
合同中的意义不明确
ambiguity in a contract benefits

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,960
使未参与起草的一方受益
the party that did not draft it,

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,230
在本案中  是莱纳德
in this case, Leonard.

80
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,630
-第一条到此为止  -但是
- So much for count one. - But...

81
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,860
没有但是  谢尔顿  法律就是这样
There's no buts, Sheldon; that's how the law works.

82
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,600
完败
Schooled!

83
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,940
至于浴室容量问题
As for the shower capacity issue,

84
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,770
我引用附录J
I cite addendum J.

85
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,280
"当谢尔顿第二个洗澡时
"When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
必须采取各种方法保证有足够的热水"
shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water."

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,380
我认为这取代了占用问题
I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,450
被取代了
Superceded!

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,060
这事没完
This isn't over.

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,300
别见怪 但是跟你淋浴做爱
No offense, but shower sex with you

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
是今天第二棒的事
is now the second best thing that's happened today.

92
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,870
披萨之夜吃希腊菜
Mmm, Greek food on pizza night?

93
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,330
这是自从我们在谢尔顿的语音邮箱里
This is the most delightfully cruel thing

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,120
留了史蒂芬·霍金的假留言以来
we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,310
对谢尔顿最残忍的事了  太愉悦了
from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.

96
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
真的吗
Seriously?

97
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,880
我想跟你讨论一下你的黑洞理论
I wish to discuss your theories of black holes.

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,220
凌晨2点  在机场旁边的兰迪甜甜圈等我
Meet me at the Randy's Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

99
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,530
你们吃的什么
What is that you're eating?

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,300
今晚是披萨之夜
Tonight is pizza night.

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,530
我要把这个问题交给我的律师回答
I'd like to refer that to my attorney.

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
根据我在这里看到的
According to what I see here,

103
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,610
周四晚上是Franconi披萨之夜
Thursday nights are Franconi's pizza night.

104
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,140
对  当Franconi倒闭时
Yes, and when Franconi's went out of business,

105
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,210
我们换成了Graziano's
we switched to Graziano's.

106
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,510
有意思
That's interesting.

107
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,280
普丽娅  可以像他那样随便更换餐厅吗
Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?

108
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,580
问得好  霍华德
A good question, Howard.

109
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,950
其实是不可以的
Turns out you can't.

110
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,510
谢尔顿  根据你所制定的条例
According to the document you drew up, Sheldon,

111
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,710
选择一家新的外卖餐厅需进行
the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires

112
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,690
公开听证会和为期六十天的评议审核
public hearings and a 60-day comment period.

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,730
以上条件均符合吗
Were those criteria met?

114
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,370
没有
No.

115
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,210
万岁  万岁  万岁
Opa! Opa! Opa!

116
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,750
这是希腊菜吗
This is Greek food?

117
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,810
莱纳德  你讨厌吃希腊菜的啊
Leonard, you hate Greek food.

118
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,380
你比我更讨厌吃啊
Not as much as you.

119
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,220
好吧  我的适应能力很强
Fine. I'm nothing if not adaptable.

120
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,460
我给你买了羊肉串
I got you the lamb kabob.

121
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,500
谢谢
Thank you.

122
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,420
其实仔细想想
If you think about it,

123
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,190
希腊菜和意大利菜有很多相似之处
Greek food isn't that far from Italian food.

124
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,690
两种菜的调料差不多
They share a spice palette.

125
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,570
还有  希腊文明多么令人赞叹啊
And what a civilization is the Greeks'!

126
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,540
他们为我们带来了科学  民主
They gave us science, democracy,

127
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,450
和尝起来像汗味的烧焦小肉块
and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.

128
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,490
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny? Penny? Penny?

129
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,620
怎么了
Hey. What's up?

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,530
那个刻薄的印度女人想逼我吃羊肉
The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb.

131
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,800
恭喜你  比萨之夜将于你家进行
Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment.

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,570
去点一个吧
Order one.

133
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,730
抱歉  亲爱的
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

134
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,670
我要和艾米  伯纳黛特共进晚餐
I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner.

135
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,670
但你可以和我们一起啊
But you're welcome to tag along.

136
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,940
女生之夜吗
A girls' night?

137
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,600
我大概没有做好心理准备
Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,310
整晚听你们讨论彩虹  独角兽和痛经
talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.

139
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,680
好吧  随你的便
Okay, suit yourself.

140
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,220
我们可能会说点普丽娅的坏话
We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.

141
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,890
副驾驶是我的
Shotgun.

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,320
好了  让我们为欢乐的女生之夜干杯
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls' night out.

143
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,730
友情提示: 我们会变得很疯狂的哦
Fair warning-- we can get ca-razy.

144
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,730
是呀  上周我们抽了雪茄
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars

145
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,800
还假装自己是龙呢
and pretended to be dragons.

146
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,430
开什么玩笑  艾米
Really, Amy?

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,900
你也开始抽烟喝酒了吗
Tobacco and alcohol?

148
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,040
需要我来提醒你没有多少科学发现
Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made

149
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,610
是在不苦逼的情况下做到的吗
by people having a good time?

150
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,980
你为什么要把他带来  太扫兴了
Why did you bring him? He's harshing my buzz.

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,120
我是因为同情他
I felt sorry for him.

152
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,150
普丽娅折磨他来着
Priya's giving him a hard time.

153
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,660
这么早就开始痛骂普丽娅了  爽
Ooh, the Priya bashing's starting early. Yay!

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,260
那个西装裤女又怎么了
Okay, what's up with those pantsuits?

155
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,090
求解释
I need some context.

156
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,400
西裤套装逊毙了
Pantsuits suck.

157
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,830
这下我们可以尽情地
And that opens her up

158
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,870
对她那套衣服嘲讽了
to justifiable ridicule for wearing them.

159
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,300
说得好  伯纳黛特
Good one, Bernadette.

160
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,410
疯狂吧
See? Ca-razy.

161
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,230
你身上有婴儿爽身粉的味道
You smell like baby powder.

162
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,460
是滑石粉
It's talc.

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,900
但由于滑石粉是婴儿爽身粉的原材料
But as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder,

164
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,370
你会搞错也是人之常情
I understand your confusion.

165
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,940
我一点都没搞错
Oh, I'm not confused at all.

166
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,140
你简直像个性感的婴儿
You're like a sexy toddler.

167
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,980
我不知道该怎么接话了
I don't know how to process that.

168
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,350
我知道
I do.

169
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,450
艾米和谢尔顿坐在树上
Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree.

170
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,360
亲亲亲亲嘴
K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.

171
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,490
"亲嘴"里面没有那么多"亲"
That's too many S's for "kissing."

172
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,760
可如果他们亲了好久呢
Not if they're doing it for a long time.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
谢尔顿...你以前亲过姑娘吗
Sheldon... have you ever kissed a girl?

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,420
我只吻过我的母亲  姐姐和奶奶
Other than my mother, my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

175
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,320
但为了让大家了解到全部真相
But in the interest of full disclosure,

176
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,790
有一次在公交车上
I was once on a bus

177
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,870
我曾为一位因轻微中暑而晕厥的老修女
and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun

178
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,210
做过嘴对嘴人工呼吸
who passed out from heat exhaustion.

179
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,250
每年圣诞节我都会收到她的贺卡
Every year I get a Christmas card from her,

180
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,790
她会在签名里加很多X和O [拥抱与亲吻]
signed with far too many X's and O's.

181
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,660
那根本不算
That doesn't count.

182
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,830
难道你一点都不好奇吗
Aren't you even a little curious?

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,490
对啊  你可是个科学家
Yeah, you're a scientist--

184
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,700
你的好奇心跑哪去了
where is the curiosity?

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,270
我能做试验品
I'm available for experimentation.

186
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,570
谢谢
Thank you.

187
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,810
没有必要
Not necessary.

188
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,070
我们已经掌握了关于接吻的所有细节
We know everything there is to know about kissing.

189
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,030
接吻需牵动34条面部肌肉
It requires 34 facial muscles

190
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,940
和112条姿势肌
and 112 postural muscles.

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,110
扯  扯  扯
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

192
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,180
亲爱的  给我点甜头尝尝
Give me some sugar, bestie.

193
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,980
令我感到庆幸的是
I'm certainly glad no one said

194
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,820
没人对阿兹特克人体祭祀感兴趣
they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.

195
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,690
对了  我们带谢尔顿去跳舞吧
Hey, I know-- let's take Sheldon dancing.

196
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,930
我超想看谢尔顿跳舞的样子
Ooh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance.

197
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,130
我敢说他会像只热锅上的蚂蚁
I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.

198
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,370
谢谢  不必了  但需要声明一下
No, thank you, but for the record,

199
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,600
我拥有精湛的舞技
I'm an excellent dancer.

200
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,310
我熟练掌握了伦巴  华尔兹和恰恰舞
Proficient in the Rumba, Waltz and Cha-cha.

201
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,410
真的吗
Really?

202
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,070
真不明白这有什么好奇怪的
I don't see why that's surprising.

203
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,810
我擅长的事太多了
I excel at so many things.

204
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,310
还吃过我做的酸面包吧
You've had my sourdough bread.

205
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,780
你上过舞蹈课吗
Did you take dance lessons?

206
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,150
虽然我不情愿
Against my will,

207
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,280
但在南方  未成年孩童
in the South, preadolescent children

208
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,720
都要强制上沙龙舞课程
are forced through a process called cotillion,

209
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,090
灌输他们必须的社交风度
which indoctrinates them with all the social graces

210
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,930
和舞蹈技能  以适应18世纪的维也纳
and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.

211
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,030
哦  我们一定一定要带你跳舞去
Oh, we are so taking you dancing.

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,400
不  你们更多的肯定是不想带
No, you most certainly are not.

213
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,070
你受过的沙龙舞训练怎么教你的
Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected

214
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,270
绅士收到三位淑女要求
of a gentleman when three ladies ask him

215
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,310
请他护送至舞会  你该怎么做
to escort them to a dance soiree?

216
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,650
我救过一位修女的命
I saved a nun's life,

217
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,880
上帝为何还要这样惩罚我
Why am I being punished?

218
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,790
带我们去能跳华尔兹的地方
Take us someplace we can waltz.

219
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,030
跳什么的地方
Where you can what?

220
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,760
华尔兹舞  这是奥地利的一种社交舞
Waltz. It's a social dance from Austria

221
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,800
精心设计的3/4拍节奏舞蹈
choreographed to a three-four time signature.

222
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,670
《蓝色多瑙河》[小约翰·施特劳斯]

223
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,740
[韩语]

224
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,050
哦  华尔兹舞啊
Oh, waltz.

225
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,190
出发
Here we go.

226
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,330
我吻了个女孩  感觉很不错
*I kissed a girl and I liked it*

227
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,560
希望我男友并不介意
*I hope my boyfriend don't mind...*

228
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,430
你秀逗了吗
What happened to you?

229
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,650
摇摆起来  宝贝  摇摆起来
Shake it baby, shake it!

230
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,550
热力四射啊  谢尔顿
<i>Muy caliente,</i> Sheldon!

231
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,590
能请你跳舞吗
Care to dance?

232
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,430
抱歉  我订婚了
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

233
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,430
这位小姐呢
How about you?

234
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,700
随便吧
Oh, what the hell.

235
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,590
我们这么聪明的人
How come if we're the smart people,

236
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,920
怎么之前没夜夜笙歌呢
we don't do this every night?

237
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,520
16乘以14等于多少
What's 16 times 14?

238
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,060
我打出的嗝有股蔓越莓饮料味
My burps taste like cranberry juice.

239
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,530
这就是你的回答
And there's your answer.

240
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,430
想进来喝一杯[nightcap也作睡帽用]吗
Would you like to come in for a nightcap?

241
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,270
如果你指的是喝杯酒水
If you're referring to the beverage,

242
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,810
你知道我不喝这些的
you know I don't drink.

243
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,310
如果你指的是睡帽
If you're referring to the hat you don

244
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,610
同时还穿着睡衣举着蜡烛的话  那我已经有一顶了
while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.

245
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,980
我家有哟呼哦[软饮]
I have Yoo-hoo.

246
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,480
这怎么忍心拒绝呢
It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

247
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,750
这名字就太吸引人了
The name literally beckons.

248
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,020
别拘束  随意吧
Make yourself comfortable.

249
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,260
谢谢
Thank you.

250
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,660
有人在抽烟吗
Is someone smoking?

251
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,600
那是因为里奇呀
Oh, that's just Ricky.

252
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
你养了只抽烟的猴子
You own a smoking monkey?

253
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,670
别傻了  这只是我实验室里
Don't be silly. He's one of the animals

254
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,810
其中一只用来研究尼古丁上瘾的
in my department's nicotine addiction study.

255
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,310
那它在这干嘛
What's he doing here?

256
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,610
既然我要让它得肺气肿
I'm giving him emphysema.

257
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,780
至少能带它出来逛逛看看电视做补偿吧
The least I can do is let him hang out and watch Cable.

258
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,050
太了不起了
Remarkable.

259
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,120
你不担心二手烟吗
Aren't you worried about secondhand smoke?

260
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,490
有点  但真正的危险是
A little. The real danger is him biting

261
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,290
它趁我睡觉咬我的脸
my face off while I'm sleeping.

262
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,700
它是故意往我脸上吹的吗
Is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?

263
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,770
对  它就是一混蛋
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

264
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,670
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,480
能让我跟你倾诉下
May I share something with you

266
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,950
让我深受困扰的事吗
that's troubling me?

267
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,950
当然
Of course.

268
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,450
是什么让你这聪慧大脑烦恼呢
What's rattling around that big bulbous head of yours?

269
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,290
普丽娅基本上使
Priya has essentially nullified

270
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,220
我和莱纳德的室友协议无效化了
my roommate agreement with Leonard,

271
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,990
令我的生活无比难受
making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.

272
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,330
你想让我杀了她吗  没问题
And you want me to kill her? Done.

273
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,200
不是的  当然不是
No, of course not.

274
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
我既然能训练里奇吸烟
I trained Ricky how to smoke.

275
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,670
就能训练它发毒镖
I can train him to shoot a poison dart.

276
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,000
陪审团不会判我们有罪  因为他们都喜欢猴子
No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.

277
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,840
我能理解
I understand

278
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,070
酒精煽动起了不知道是什么
the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is

279
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,140
反正能让女人变狂野
that makes girls go wild...

280
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,110
但我现在真的得跟聪明艾米谈话
but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.

281
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,180
失陪一下
Excuse me.

282
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,820
难道你还没意识到你的非凡智慧
Have you considered that your intelligence

283
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,090
可能就是导致你这一困境的罪魁
might be the very thing causing your dilemma?

284
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,060
没
No.

285
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,360
你以为当有入侵者侵入
What do you think Ricky over here would do

286
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
里奇的地盘  它会怎么做
if an interloper encroached on his territory?

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,870
面临挑战  猴子们会追赶  攻击
Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance

288
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,240
还有露阴等办法  来维护自己的统治
through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display.

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,680
这个我可有点做不来
That's a little outside my comfort zone.

290
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,180
你太夸张了
You're being too literal.

291
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,520
我是说  它不会轻易屈服于规则
My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules,

292
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,250
你也不该屈服
and neither should you.

293
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,190
你是建议我使坏吗
Are you suggesting I play dirty?

294
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,520
对  使坏
Yes, dirty.

295
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,960
使坏  使坏  使坏
Dirty... dirty... dirty.
[来吧  对我使坏吧]

296
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,230
说到这  我想进行第二阶段行动了
Which brings me to our next order of business.

297
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,840
真"醉"人
Fascinating.

298
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,080
接下来我要做的事  我希望不会是
I hope you don't take what I'm about to do

299
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,110
你对刚才咱俩刚做的事的评语
as a comment on what we just did.

300
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,700
是谁说的你不应该被植入人类的脑细胞呢
Who's to say you shouldn't be dissecting our brains?

301
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,830
你还真是个混蛋
You really are an ass.

302
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,770
早安  谢尔顿
Morning, Sheldon.

303
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,540
很好  你们起来了
Oh, good, you're up.

304
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,640
我写了一份经过改良
I've written a new and improved

305
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,340
好让我占大便宜的新室友协议
roommate agreement that benefits me greatly.

306
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,380
我想让你把它签了
I'd like you to sign it.

307
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,250
我为什么要签
Why would I want to do that?

308
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,020
问得好
Excellent question.

309
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,950
你记得由天才演员弗兰克·乔辛客串
Do you remember what happened to the alien,

310
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,720
《星际迷航》里那集"最后的战役"
played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin,

311
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,860
里面的外星人下场如何吧
in the <i>Star Trek</i> episode "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

312
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,770
柯克船长激活自毁程序
Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence

313
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,000
威胁要炸毁进取号
and threatened to blow up the <i>Enterprise</i>

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,240
除非他投降  否则一起同归于尽
and kill them both unless he gave in?

315
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,500
正确
Affirmative.

316
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,540
计算机  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

317
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,050
激活自毁程序
Activate self-destruct sequence.

318
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,650
代号11A2B
Code 1-1-A-2-B.

319
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,320
自毁程序已激活
Self-destruct sequence activated.

320
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,360
你打算怎么做  谢尔顿
What are you gonna do, Sheldon,

321
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,760
炸飞这间公寓吗
blow up the apartment?

322
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,200
我一开始是这么想的  但我的宝贝都在这
That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.

323
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
那倒数完了之后会怎么样
So what happens when it counts down?

324
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,000
除非莱纳德在接下来的41秒里
Unless Leonard signs the new agreement

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,070
把这份新协议签了
in the next 41 seconds,

326
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,010
否则它就会给你远在印度的父母发一封电邮
this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India

327
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,240
揭发你跟一个比棉花糖霜还白的男人
saying that you're in a secret relationship

328
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,610
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
with the whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

329
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,280
搞地下情
Leonard Hofstadter.

330
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,120
天啊
Oh, my God.

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,220
这有什么大不了的
What's the big deal?

332
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,780
相信我  这是大事
Trust me, it's a big deal.

333
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,890
他们迟早会知道我的  对吧
They're gonna find out about me eventually, right?

334
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,390
对  当然  但不是今天
Yeah, of course, just not today.

335
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,960
还剩20秒
20 seconds.

336
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,120
你觉得我拿不出手
Are you ashamed of me?

337
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,330
当然不是
Of course not.

338
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,960
那为什么不能告诉你父母
Then why can't we tell your parents?

339
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,300
拜托  别逼我
Please, don't push this.

340
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,560
他一直都这样  不是吗  还剩15秒
He does that all the time, doesn't he? 15.

341
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,600
好吧  谢尔顿  你赢了  关了它
Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.

342
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,670
不  他在虚张声势呢
No, he's bluffing.

343
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,000
-我从来不虚张声势  还剩10秒  -你这是敲诈
- I never bluff. Ten. - It's blackmail!

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,070
-还剩10秒  -我们投降了
- Nine. - We give up.

345
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,110
-还剩8秒  -这太荒谬了
- Eight. - This is ridiculous.

346
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,870
这台电脑早就充满电了
It's a laptop with a full charge.

347
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,410
说实话  你到底看上他哪点
Honestly, what do you see in him?

348
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,340
照他说的做  不然咱们就分手
Give him what he wants or we're done.

349
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,310
-还剩3秒  -说真的
- Three. - Really?

350
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,880
-最后两秒  -好  我签

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,550
自毁程序中断
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

352
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,720
你也许在剑桥上过学
You may have gone to Cambridge,

353
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,790
但哥可是星舰学院的荣誉毕业生
but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy.

354
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,040
早上好  艾米
Good morning, Amy.

355
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,150
这句问候语肯定是反语
It most assuredly is not.

356
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,580
你是不是口渴  头疼
Are you experiencing dehydration, headache,

357
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,750
恶心  还有羞愧呢
nausea and shame?

358
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,620
是
Yes.

359
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,890
我还发现我的事业线里
I also found a Korean man's business card

360
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,330
藏着一张韩国男人的名片
tucked into my cleavage.

361
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,590
昨晚发生什么事了
What happened last night?

362
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
啊哈  记忆障碍
Ah, memory impairment;

363
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,100
干完每瓶伏尔加之后  都会免费得到这个奖赏
the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.

364
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,240
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

365
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,400
好吧
All right.

366
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,970
昨晚  鉴于我在家的问题
Last night you gave me some excellent advice

367
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,340
你给了我一些很好的建议
regarding my problem here at home,

368
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,780
你亲完我  然后断断续续干呕了40分钟
you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes,

369
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,580
之后你就昏倒在厕所地板上
following which you passed out on your bathroom floor.

370
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,690
我折了块毛巾  垫在你头下作为枕头
I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow,

371
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,620
还给你烤箱调到正确的时间
set your oven clock to the correct time

372
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,790
因为它太让我抓狂了
because it was driving me crazy...

373
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,590
然后我就走了
...and I left.

374
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,760
好吧
Okay.

375
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,330
真不知道接下来咱俩该怎么办
Don't really know where we go from here.

376
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,000
我建议把我们的关系
I suggest we treat our relationship

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,200
看作是一台当机的电脑
as if it were a crashed computer

378
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,770
还原到上一次我们都觉得可行的点
and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.

379
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,140
很好  谢谢你
Terrific. Thank you.

380
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,450
没有薄荷糖卖了
They were out of menthols!

381
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,250
快从我背上滚下来
Get off my back!

382
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,590
跟坏脾气的灵长动物一起生活真不容易呀
Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.

383
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,020
说啊  普丽娅  你就直说是我让你觉得羞愧吧
Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!

384
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,130
姐们儿  我懂的
You're preaching to the choir, sister.
