00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,370
《生活大爆炸》  前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,310
猜我在洛杉矶机场发现谁了  我的妹妹普丽娅
Guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,050
真高兴再次见到你 莱纳德

谢谢
Thanks.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,210
-你上了我妹妹  -对
- You slept with my sister?! - Yeah.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,920
这是对我信任莫大的背叛
This is a terrible betrayal of my trust!

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,770
要是我告诉你
Would it help if I told you

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,290
我向她献出真心
that I offered her my heart,

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,860
却被她狠狠践踏  你会好受点么
and she kinda stomped on it?!

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,100
她践踏得多狠
How hard did she stomp?

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,590
相当狠
Very hard.

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,870
好吧  好受多了
Okay, I'm good.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,340
什么事那么好笑
What's so funny?

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,150
没什么  只是在想
Nothing. Just thinking

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,060
人做爱时发出的声音
about the noises people make during sex.

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,240
我有时确实有点不能自已  是吧
I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,770
很可爱
It's cute.

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,360
听起来像只喝醉的猴子
You sound a little like a drunken monkey.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,010
你懂的  那其实是对你的赞美
You know it's meant as a compliment.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,890
我也是这么理解的
That's how I take it.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,590
太完美了
This is perfect.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,470
真希望这一刻永远停留
I hope this moment never ends.

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,900
我也是
Me, too.

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,570
噢  该走了
Well, gotta go. Oh!

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,480
这么快  留下来过夜吧
Already? Why don't you stay over?

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,510
我也想  但是你知道
I'd love to, but you know

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,940
我妈早上需要我
my mother needs me in the morning.

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,730
拜托  我认为她能
Please. I think the woman can manage

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,200
自己戴假发
to put a wig on by herself.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,220
不仅仅是假发
It's not just the wig.

33
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,600
还要把她的头发盘起来  画眉毛
It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,290
是两个人才能干的活儿
It's a two-person job.

35
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,930
只是  我们刚做完爱你就走
It's just, when you leave right after we make love,

36
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,640
让我觉得自己
it makes me feel...

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,210
很贱
cheap.

38
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,110
亲爱的  对不起
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,720
我能做什么呢
What can I do?

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,170
留下来
Stay.

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,710
好吧
Okay.

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,310
再待个五分  十分钟吗
Like, what, another five, ten minutes?

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,060
回家吧
Go home.

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,560
听你的
Your call.

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,240
霍华德
Howard...

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,070
你有考虑过一起住吗
have you ever considered us living together?

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,050
天啊  我不知道
Boy, I don't know.

48
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,100
你  我  妈住在同一屋檐下
You, me, Ma living under the same roof?

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,470
不是  我是说只有你和我
No, I mean just you and me.

50
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,400
你可以搬过来
You can move in here,

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,210
或者我们另找个住处
or we can find a place.

52
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,840
-我有个更好的主意 -什么
- I've got a better solution. - What?

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,540
我妈吃那么多盐  心脏早晚受不了
We wait for my mom's heart to explode

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,270
我们等她心脏崩溃
from all the salt she eats.

55
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,740
把她埋进土里  把她的床垫翻个面儿
Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress

56
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,370
搬进大卧室
and move into the big bedroom.

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,300
很好
Great.

58
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,020

是性侵者吗

性侵者没有钥匙  妈

62
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,460
这么晚你到哪儿去了

63

我和伯纳黛特出去了

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120

我看《菲尔博士》

希望上帝保佑  但愿你用避孕套了
I hope to God you used a condom!

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,020
我不跟你谈这个话题  妈
I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!

68
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,600
上帝保佑你不会得个什么新型怪性病

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,180
希望如此
I hope not!

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,440
我跟你共用一个厕所呢
I share a toilet with you!

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,290
那就是你想的吗
Is that what you want?!

73
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,840
想让你妈妈得上疱疹吗
To give your mother herpes?!

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,100
够啦  我受够啦
That's it! I don't have to take this!

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,780
祝你早上画眉毛顺利
Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!

76
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,690

我还没走
I'm still leaving!

还在争哪部《犯罪现场调查》最棒吗

91
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,860
不是  我们一致同意它们各有千秋

是关于伯纳黛特
This was about Bernadette.

93
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,180

霍华德今晚要在这睡

没
No.

茶听起来是不错

你听见他的话了  莱纳德

与此同时  我也心情不好
And while you're at it, I'm upset

104
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,010
有个问题
Point of inquiry,

105
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,620
既然莱纳德是你的第二好友
given that Leonard is your secondary friend

106
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,650
库萨帕里才是你的头号好友
and Koothrappali is your primary friend,

107
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,210
你为什么没去他那
why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?

108
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,130
没地方
There's no room.

我现在很郁闷
I'm down in the dumps here.

113
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,790
普丽娅来了吗
Priya's in town?

114
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,300
对  为了工作的事

115
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,850
我妈好像觉得伯纳黛特
Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette...

116
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,220
等下  普丽娅啥时候来的
Hold on. When did Priya get here?

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,510
不知道  几天前吧
I don't know. A couple of days ago.

118
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,250
问题是 伯纳黛特不喜欢我每天
The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care

119
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,480
照顾我妈  我妈又不信任伯纳黛特
of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette...

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,310
嗯  确实很难办
Yeah, that's a real pickle.

121
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,590
拜拜
Bye.

122
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,530
别担心
Don't worry.

123
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,310
作为你排名第三的好朋友
As your tertiary friend,

124
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,830
我愿意挺身而出安慰你
I am prepared to step in and comfort you.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,540
其实用不着这样
That's not really necessary.

126
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,140
不行不行  我来把茶泡好
No, no. I'll finish making the tea,

127
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,840
你继续自说自话地
while you narcissistically ramble on

128
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,810
倒那什么乱七八糟的苦水吧
about whatever's troubling you.

129
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,960
多谢
Thanks.

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,370
这就是排在第三位的朋友的作用
That's what tertiary friends are for.

131
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,050
谁啊
Who is it?

132
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,430
莱纳德
It's Leonard.

133
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,520
你不能进来
You can't come in.

134
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,000
我就想和她说句话
I just want to talk to her.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,670
我毙之
I forbid it.

136
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,180
开门吧  拉杰
Open the door, Rajesh.

137
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,130
我说过了
You heard me.

138
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,780
我毙毙之
I forbidded it.

139
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,090
"毙毙之"
"Forbidded" it?

140
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,520
"吡毙之"
"Forbaded" it?

141
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,630
给我让开
Get out of the way.

142
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,490
你来做什么
What are you doing here?

143
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,690
你又是来做什么
What are you doing here?

144
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,560
我在洛杉矶有点公事
I have business in Los Angeles.

145
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
为什么不给我打电话
Why didn't you call?

146
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
显然啊  她在暗示你
Clearly, she was sending you a message

147
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,040
滚远点  迈克同学
to take a hike, Mike.

148
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,480
不好意思  我想过给你打电话
I'm sorry. I thought about calling,

149
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,100
但我不知道和你再见面到底合不合适
but I just wasn't sure if seeing you was such a good idea.

150
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,840
我懂  上次我有些太着急了
I know. Last time I came on too strong.

151
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,350
咱俩能单独聊聊吗
Can we talk in private?

152
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,090
-不行  -行啊
- No! - Sure.

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,400
一个单身女人私下招待男性
It's completely inappropriate for a single woman

154
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
这实在太荒唐了
to entertain a man in private.

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,770
要是你俩非得聊的话  就在沙发上聊
If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch!

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,510
好吧  你俩可以在卧室里聊
All right, you may talk in the bedroom,

157
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,580
但是我要求你们不许关门
but I want this door to remain open!

158
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,630
好吧  这次让你关门
All right, just this once you may close the door.

159
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,170
但你给我记住  我就在外面
But keep in mind I'll be right out here

160
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,900
监视你俩的动向
monitoring the situation!

161
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,440
该死
Oh, damn it.

162
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,950
莱纳德  听到这条留言后请速回电
Leonard, when you get this message, call me.

163
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,520
普丽娅  我是你哥
Priya, this is your brother.

164
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,350
听到留言后请让莱纳德查收他的语音信箱
When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.

165
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,540
你今晚还住我们那儿吗
Would you be sleeping over again this evening?

166
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,290
因为我们很欢迎你
Because you're welcome to.

167
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,580
承蒙美意  但是我自己有计划
That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
你只要记得只要你需要一位
Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need

169
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,920
略显冷淡的第三好的朋友
a slightly apathetic tertiary friend,

170
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
我时刻准备着
I stand at the ready.

171
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
嗨  霍华德  嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,210
-嗨  -嗨
- Hello. - Hey.

173
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,140
你俩为啥牵着手
Why are you holding hands?

174
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,120
我禁止你俩牵手
I forbid you to hold hands.

175
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,750
拉杰  你知道莱纳德和我一起过夜了
Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.

176
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,970
对  但是你俩只是睡觉而已
Yeah, but you were just sleeping,

177
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,260
因为我禁子你俩做爱了
because I forboded you to have sex.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,550
应该是"禁止"
The word is "forbade""

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,410
你确定吗  听起来怪怪的
You sure? That doesn't sound right.

180
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,390
听着  拉杰  莱纳德和我已经决定
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided

181
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,830
重拾旧情了
to see each other again,

182
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,190
你不可以决定
and you don't get to tell me

183
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,760
我该和谁拍拖
who I can and can't have a relationship with.

184
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
其实  他可以
Actually, he can.

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,300
印度的《摩奴法典》对这类问题有明确规定
The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters.

186
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,330
如果一个女人的父亲不在
If a woman's father is not around,

187
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,050
那么控制她基本欲望的责任
the duty of controlling her base desires falls

188
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,880
就落在了她最亲的男性亲属身上  也就是拉杰
to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj.

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,940
法典还规定
The code also states

190
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,670
如果她违背了的话  她下辈子将
that if she disobeys, she will be reborn

191
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,950
"投胎为豺  疾病缠身"
"in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases."

192
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,940
如果这是真的
If true,

193
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
考虑到奖品只是莱纳德
that seems like an awfully large gamble

194
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
你这个赌注貌似下得大了点
given that the prize is Leonard.

195
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,050
就是这样  普丽娅  我们是印度人
There it is, Priya. We're Indian.

196
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,570
就信这些玩意
We believe this stuff.

197
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,110
我觉得法典上还说  如果你吃牛肉了
I think it also says that if you eat beef,

198
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,700
就得和母牛一起住三个月
you need to live with cows for three months

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,790
天天喝牛尿
and drink their urine.

200
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,030
良莠参半  不可全信
Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy.

201
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,540
我是说  你不能和莱纳德在一起
My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.

202
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,670
谁不能和莱纳德在一起
Who can't go out with Leonard?

203
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,080
我妹妹
My sister.

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,270
佩妮  这位是拉杰的妹妹  普丽娅
Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.

205
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,560
很高兴见到你
It's very nice to meet you.

206
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,180
哦  我也是
Oh, yeah, you, too.

207
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,350
普丽娅  如果你觉得有些紧张或者尴尬
Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness,

208
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,380
很可能是因为莱纳德和佩妮以前曾经
it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to--

209
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,440
用霍华德的话来说叫做"赤裸共舞"
if I may quote Howard-- "do the dance with no pants."

210
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,100
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,370
你非得这么说吗
Really?

212
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,380
伯纳黛特  我能跟你说句话吗
Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?

213
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,570
好
Sure.

214
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,660
佩妮  作为莱纳德曾经的恋人  你和他
Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard

215
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,520
分手了
as a lover.

216
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,730
能不能跟我妹妹说说是为啥
Would you please tell my sister why?

217
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,680
跟你说哈  我妈要去棕榈泉市
Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs

218
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
拜访她妹妹
to visit her sister.

219
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,730
我就有整整两个晚上
That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over

220
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,160
能陪着你到天亮了
with you all the way to morning.

221
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,940
除非沙漠的干旱气候让她鼻窦干得厉害
Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses,

222
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,280
那样的话我就得扛着
in which case I'll have to schlep out there

223
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,870
庞大的增湿器赶过去
with the big humidifier.

224
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,440
就这样吗
That's it?

225
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,660
这就是解决咱俩这些问题的妙招吗
That's your big solution to all of our problems?

226
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,690
趁你妈不注意  我们才得两晌贪欢
If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?

227
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,070
这不很美妙吗
Isn't that great?

228
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,250
不  并不好
No, it's not great.

229
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,010
你得作出选择  要我还是你妈
You need to make a choice.Me or your mother.

230
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,370
回答错误
Wrong answer.

231
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,860
不  等等
No, wait.

232
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,800
我还没说完
You didn't let me finish.

233
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,440
我听着呢
I'm listening.

234
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,360
我尽最快速度赶来了
I came as quickly as I could.

235
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,240
好的
Okay.

236
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,510
为什么
Why?

237
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,430
当然是赶来安慰你
To comfort you, of course.

238
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,970
谢尔顿说了莱纳德跟拉杰妹妹约会的事
Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister.

239
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,160
所以我赶到这里
So I high-tailed it over here

240
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,460
来安慰你破碎的心
to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.

241
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,310
艾米  我没事
Amy, I'm fine.

242
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,520
你不用在我面前逞强的
You don't have to be strong for me.

243
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,290
我们来谈谈普丽娅那偷男人的婊子
Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.

244
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,710
什么
What?

245
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,110
在这样的情况下
In situations like this,

246
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,250
闺蜜经常都一起声讨小三的
best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman.

247
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,030
真的  我对莱纳德和普丽娅的事毫不伤心
Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.

248
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,190
那你可能是并不清楚是怎么回事
Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on.

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,130
你的前男友另找了
Your former boyfriend has replaced you

250
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,230
一个看上去非常相配的女友
with what appears to be a very suitable mate.

251
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,840
可以说比你更相配得多
Arguably much more suitable than you.

252
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,170
好吧  那对他来说不错啊
Oh. Well, good for him.

253
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,750
你说"更相配"是什么意思
Hey, what do you mean, "More suitable"?

254
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,290
佩妮  虽然你的第二性征
Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics

255
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,550
相当明显
are reasonably bodacious.

256
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,870
但普丽娅有高学历
but Priya is highly educated,

257
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,330
她是成熟的专业人员  她们的文化中
she's an accomplished professional,she comes from the culture

258
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,630
甚至还有性爱宝典
that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex.

259
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,530
而你  只是社区大学辍学生
Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout

260
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,580
你们那的文化中  只有如何把牛推倒的书
who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.

261
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,020
好吧  我听懂了
Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it.

262
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,150
那些都是什么
So... what is all that stuff?

263
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,670
这是个便携式脑电波机
This is a portable electroencephalogram.

264
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,090
我正在做关于情绪和大脑活动的研究
I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity.

265
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,180
所以你哭的时候
So when you start crying,

266
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,750
我能看到你大脑的哪一区域被激活
I can see which region of the brain is activated.

267
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,460
然后我就刺激猕猴大脑中
Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area

268
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,220
相似区域  看它是否也会哭
in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries.

269
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,540
很酷吧
Cool, huh?

270
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,570
我选你
I choose you.

271
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,320
真的吗
Really?

272
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,160
对  我搬出了我妈家
Yep. I moved out of my mother's house.

273
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,450
切断了束缚  我是你的了
Cord is cut.I'm all yours.

274
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,750
你告诉她时  她怎么说
What did she say when you told her?

275
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,630
不知道  她还没回我的电邮
I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.

276
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,690
太好了
This is so great.

277
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,330
我爱你  霍华德
I love you, Howard.

278
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,800
我也爱你
I love you, too.

279
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,230
晚饭吃什么
So what's for dinner?

280
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,910
我家里没什么东西吃
Well, I don't really have much of anything in the house.

281
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,130
没事
That's fine.

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,960
不如先去我们的卧室做点好事
Why don't we go fool around in our bedroom?

283
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
然后你可以去买东西
And then you can go shopping.

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,280
我想吃完后  我们去看个早场电影吧
I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.

285
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
好啊
I'd love that.

286
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,600
我喜欢你说"好啊"的口音
I love the way you say, "I'd love that."

287
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,830
哥也是这么说的
She says it the same way I do.

288
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,020
好啊
"I'd love that."

289
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,940
印度人人都这么说  没什么了不起的
Everybody in India says it that way.It's not a big deal.

290
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,900
拉杰  别这么幼稚
Rajesh, don't be a child.

291
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,460
我没在耍幼稚
I'm not being a child.

292
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,410
莱纳德  我对天发誓
Leonard, I swear to God,

293
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,430
你姐姐要是来这
if your sister ever comes to town,

294
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,460
我也会好好"关照"她的
I shall have my way with her.

295
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,760
我姐姐38岁已婚
My sister's 38 and married.

296
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,030
模仿莎士比亚句式
那就让霍夫斯塔德家族蒙受更多耻辱
All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.

297
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,220
我好像闻到了披萨味
Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

298
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,470
太了不起了
That's remarkable.

299
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,760
要是意大利辣香肠是爆炸物
If pepperoni were an explosive substance,

300
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,310
你就可以取代国家机场的德国牧羊犬了
you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.

301
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,730
你好  你是佩妮对吧
Hi. Penny, right?

302
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,790
对  你好  抱歉
Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

303
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,910
我不知道你们有客人  不想来打扰
I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.

304
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,490
不  你这不是打扰
No, no. It's not an imposition.

305
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,990
此时在我们的生态系统中  你就相当于千鸟
At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover,

306
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,940
千鸟又叫牙签鸟  常充当鳄鱼牙签的角色
一种小型净化鸟类  从鳄鱼的牙缝间
a small scavenging bird that eats extra food

307
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,390
吃掉多余的食物
from between the teeth of crocodiles.

308
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,460
请飞到我们张开的咽喉  尽情享用吧
Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.

309
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,810
要不是我冰箱就剩一瓶小苏打
If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator,

310
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,550
我肯定不吃这嗟来之食
I wouldn't have to take that.

311
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,480
嗨  闺蜜
Hi, bestie.

312
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
嗨
Hi.

313
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,620
普丽娅  你是律师  对吧
So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?

314
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,290
我懂  很无聊是吧
I know. Pretty boring, huh?

315
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,860
拜托  一点都不无聊
Oh, come on. It's not boring at all.

316
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,200
她正在帮助建立一个二级市场
She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market

317
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,840
以便海外汽车公司巩固其投资
which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments

318
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,920
以对抗电池技术的潜在进步
against potential advancements in battery technology.

319
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,260
谢谢你  莱纳德
Thank you, Leonard.

320
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,920
让我的工作听着一点都不无聊了
That doesn't make it sound boring at all.

321
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,880
抱歉...
I'm sorry , but...

322
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,370
你还好吧
So, how you holding up?

323
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,140
我没事
I'm fine.

324
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,570
开什么玩笑  她那么动人
Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.

325
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,470
佩妮
So, Penny,

326
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,930
莱纳德跟我说  你是个演员
Leonard tells me you're an actress.

327
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,840
这工作肯定相当令人兴奋吧
That must be pretty exciting.

328
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,430
对  是挺棒的
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great.

329
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,040
今天我开车去范奈司试镜
Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition

330
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,380
我原以为是一个猫食的广告
I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial.

331
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,460
到那才发现是黄片
Turned out to be porn.

332
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,110
你有幸参演吗
Did you get the part?

333
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,830
我连试镜都没试
I didn't do the audition.

334
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,220
鉴于你岌岌可危的职业生涯
Given the state of your career,

335
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,490
你还能挑三拣四的吗
can you really afford to be picky?

336
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,260
我在剑桥的时候上过表演课
I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge.

337
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,470
我超爱的
I loved it.

338
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,980
我们当时教的是《驯悍记》[莎士比亚著名喜剧]
We did Taming of the Shrew.

339
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,170
哇  我超爱《驯悍记》
Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew.

340
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,650
我高中的时候还写过一篇论文呢
I did a paper on it in high school.

341
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,560
"谁不知道黄蜂的刺是在什么地方
"Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?

342
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
在尾巴上"
In his tail."

343
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,770
-"在舌头上"  -"谁的舌头"
- "In his tongue" - "Whose tongue?"

344
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,290
"你的  如果你谈论的是尾巴
"Yours, if you talk of tails,

345
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,640
保重啦"
and so farewell."

346
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,560
"什么  我的舌头在你的尾巴上"
"What, with my tongue in your tail?"

347
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,820
真后悔之前我对她做出这么恶毒的评价
I'm regretting my earlier cattiness.

348
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,210
她绝对是个可人儿
She is an absolute delight.

349
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,450
爽
Wow.

350
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,540
爽死了
Wow, indeed.

351
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,710
真不敢相信我们终于住在一起了
I can't believe we're finally living together.

352
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,950
是啊
Yeah.

353
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,330
你知道什么能让这一刻更加完美吗
You know what would make this moment perfect?

354
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,230
什么
What?

355
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,000
零食  你有奶酪棒吗
A little snack. You got any string cheese?

356
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,730
没有  我可能有些干酪
No. I-I might have some cheddar.

357
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,840
那个不好
Not as good.

358
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,670
拼不成绳子
You can't make strings with it.

359
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,220
记得提醒我把它加入你的购物清单
Remind me to put it on your shopping list.

360
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,690
好吧
Okay.

361
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,820
你有低敏配方的洗衣粉吗
You have hypo-allergenic detergent?

362
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,910
没有
No.

363
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,250
那这个也要买哦
Better put it on the list.

364
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,010
如果你用普通的肥皂帮我洗内内
If you wash my underwear with regular soap,

365
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,420
我的屁屁会长小红点
I get little red bumps on my tuchus.

366
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,530
等等
Wait a second.

367
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,600
我还要帮你洗衣服
I'm doing your laundry?

368
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,430
拜托  宝贝  衣服又不会自己跳进洗衣机
Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself.

369
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,350
差点忘了
Oh, before I forget,

370
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,740
明天早上你得开车送我去看牙医
tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.

371
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,840
我一定要载你去吗
I have to take you?

372
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,870
现在不是一定要你做  而是你必须要做
You don't have to take me. You get to take me.

373
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,420
慢着  你的意思是
Wait a minute. Are you telling me

374
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,410
你妈妈通常都带你去看牙医吗
your mother usually takes you to the dentist?

375
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,430
这有什么奇怪的
It's not weird.

376
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,100
诊所里有很多小孩都是妈妈陪着来的
There's lots of kids there with their moms.

377
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,520
真让人难以置信
I can't believe this.

378
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,350
为什么  多有爱呀
What? It's fun.

379
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,380
如果我没有蛀牙
If I have no cavities,

380
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,660
检查过后  我们就去大餐一顿
afterwards, we go out for a treat.

381
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,070
够了  霍华德
All right, Howard,

382
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,980
有件事我必须得跟你直说
let's get something straight right now.

383
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,890
我不会像你妈一样照顾你的
I'm not going to be your mother.

384
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,010
喂  喂  喂
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

385
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,080
此话怎讲
Where did that come from?

386
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,470
谁啊
Who's that?!

387
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,490
是性侵者吗
Is it a sex criminal?!

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,660
妈  在你面前谁都硬不起来
Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma!

389
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,660
你死去哪里了
Where were you?!

390
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,310
你没看见我的电子邮件吗
Didn't you read my email?!

391
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,770
你也知道我不会开那破电脑
You know I can't turn on that ferkakta computer!

392
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,280
我给你留了点鸡胸肉在厨房柜台上
I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter!

393
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,480
谢谢
Thank you!

394
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,880
吃完记得用牙线剔干净
Remember to floss after.

395
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,440
明天早上我们得去看牙医
We have the dentist in the morning!

396
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,440
有事吗
Oh, hey. What's up?

397
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,080
我只是来看看你怎么样
I just wanted to check in on you.

398
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,940
为什么
Why?

399
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,390
这是最恰当不过的事情
It seems like the appropriate thing to do

400
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,160
因为当自己好朋友发现自己被
when one's best friend finds herself replaced

401
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
一个聪明美丽的女人所取代
by a smart, beautiful woman

402
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,150
而她如同温顺的孟加拉母老虎  有一种蓄势待发的性欲
with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.

403
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,340
我跟你说过  我没事
I already told you, I'm okay with it.

404
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,380
我是说  我甚至于还很高兴
I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased

405
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,070
莱纳德找到了
that Leonard has found someone

406
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,150
能让他开心的人
that makes him so happy.

407
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,690
没事的  没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

408
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,110
谢谢
Thank you.

409
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,380
现在先把这些电极贴上
Now, let's get these electrodes attached

410
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,740
看看你的小脑袋里到底哪部分让你哭泣
and see what's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.

411
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,150
好的
Okay.

412
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,050
我闻到中国菜的味道
I smell Chinese food.

413
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,940
其实是泰国菜
It's actually Thai.

414
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,320
你的嗅觉下降了
You're slipping.

415
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,200
莱纳德和普丽娅在吗
