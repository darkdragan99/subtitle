1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,800
你们想好点啥菜了吗
Hey, you guys ready to order?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,440
-想好了  -好的  普丽娅
- Uh, sure. - Okay, Priya?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,120
我来一份肉馅土豆泥饼
Uh, I'll have the shepherd's pie.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,050
你想和我分着吃一份吗
You want to split that with me?

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,800
别别别  他不会愿意的
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,240
为啥
Why not?

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,540
土豆泥里面有牛奶
Well, you have milk in the taters,

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,520
肉汁里面有牛奶  还有帕尔玛干酪饼皮
milk in the gravy, parmesan crust.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,180
你这位乳糖不耐的男朋友会变成
Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,220
一个充气的感恩节大气球
into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,330
你说的不全对
Not quite accurate.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,540
感恩节气球里充的都是氦气
The Macy's balloons are filled with helium,

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,870
而莱纳德肚子里造出来的是大量的甲烷
whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,720
所以  还是别点肉馅土豆泥饼了
So, no, on the shepherd's pie.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,350
能接着点菜吗
Can we move on?

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,260
行  再给一条小贴士  他说自己能吃冻酸奶
Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yogurt.

17
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,990
千万别信
Do not believe it.

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,680
海鲈  我想来份海鲈
Sea bass! I'll have the sea bass!

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
你得习惯啊
You gotta like this,

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,880
现任女友和前任女友通过
the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,110
聊你的糗事来联络感情
over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,140
杀了我吧
Kill me.

23
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,550
没用的  人体能在死亡数小时内
It wouldn't help. The human body is capable

24
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,260
一直制造气体
of being flatulent for hours after death.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,600
各位  抱歉来晚了
Guys, sorry I'm late.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,720
我有个好消息
I have amazing news.

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,640
伯纳黛特  在你换话题之前
Bernadette, before you change the subject,

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,490
有人想对莱纳德糟糕的消化系统
does anyone have any final comments on

29
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,460
来个终极吐槽吗
Leonard's faulty digestive system?

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,330
啥好消息啊  伯纳黛特
So, what's your news, Bernadette?

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,120
论文委员会接受了我的博士论文
The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,870
我拿到博士学位了
I'm getting my PhD!

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,240
哇  恭喜恭喜
Wow! Oh, congratulations.

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,980
哇  这就意味着你是博士  你是博士
Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor,

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,920
你也是博士  你还是博士
you're a doctor, you're a doctor,

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,570
而霍华德  你认识不少博士啊
and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,150
祝贺你呀  亲爱的
Congratulations, honey.

38
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,070
谢谢
Thank you.

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,300
霍华德  跟我们说说当你得知
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,390
等你俩结婚了  大家得叫你们
that when you two get married,

41
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,080
沃罗威茨先生和沃罗威茨博士  你作何感想
you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,550
除非他能随伯纳黛特的姓
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.

43
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,080
考虑到伯纳黛特的地位更高
And considering her advanced status,

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,250
这么做未尝不可
that could open some doors for him.

45
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,010
拜托  今天的主角不是我
Please, this isn't about me.

46
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,500
我真为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,230
还有更让你骄傲的呢
Well, you'll be really be proud of this.

48
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,130
我被一家大型医药公司看中了
I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company.

49
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,970
他们要给我提供巨额薪金
They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!

50
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,070
什么
What?

51
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,010
伯纳黛特  这太好了
Bernadette, that's great.

52
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,110
霍华德  你能挣巨额的钱吗
Howard, do you make a buttload?

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,440
反正比你放巨额的屁强
Better than what you've got a buttload of.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,120
喂  要是我摇下车窗玻璃  一切都还是很美好的
Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy.

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,540
可如果你也这么做  你还是当不了博士
If you do it, you're still not a doctor.

56
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,510
嗯  车窗户这这句我得吐个槽
Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal.

57
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,770
虽然说得对  但不是每件事都那么美好
It helps, but everything is not "peachy."

58
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,310
生活大爆炸第四季第二十四集[本季终]

59
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,330
*如果你有问题  你又不能解决*
*Oh, if there was a problem, you can't solve it*
嘻哈歌曲《Ice Ice baby》

60
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,380
*接受这诱惑  让我的DJ来解决*
*Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it*

61
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,380
*冰  冰  宝贝*
*Ice, Ice, baby*

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,810
*冰  冰  宝贝*
*Ice, Ice, baby*

63
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,070
天啊  我觉得穿着这件衣服显得好傻啊
Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,560
你看起来美极了  乌胡拉少尉
You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura.

65
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,080
那现在开始准备  检查
Now prepare for... inspection.

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,300
嘘  别让我哥听见了
Shh, my brother's going to hear you.

67
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,010
放心吧  他带着耳机呢
Relax, he's got headphones on.

68
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,100
而我们正在距地球16公里远的星际飞船里呢
And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.

69
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,000
开玩笑吧  才16公里
Really, ten miles?

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,340
还在大气层里转悠啊
You're orbiting inside the atmosphere?
地球大气的平均厚度约为1000公里

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,460
脑残
Moron.

72
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,100
我真不敢相信我在穿我哥的万圣节化妆服
I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,940
我真不敢相信你真以为他只在万圣节的时候穿
I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween.

74
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,360
打开"降落舱门"  "航天飞机"正在进入
Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.

75
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,290
好吧  我得撤了
Okay, gotta go.

76
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,090
嗨  怎么了
Hey, what's up?

77
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,460
是我未来的儿媳博士来了吗
Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?!

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,610
不是  妈  是拉杰
No, Ma! It's Raj!

79
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,150
-他也是博士  对吗  -对
- He's a doctor too, right?! - Yes!

80
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,060
跟莱纳德和那个竹竿子一样
Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,850
那是谢尔顿  没错
Sheldon, yes!

82
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,380
除了我  大家都是博士
Everybody's a doctor but me!

83
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,960
那能怪谁呢
Well, whose fault is that?!

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
怎么了
What's up?

85
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,530
莱纳德在我的记忆海绵床垫上
Leonard's putting disgusting memories in

86
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,960
制造恶心的记忆
my memory foam mattress.

87
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,900
我今晚能睡你这儿吗
Can I stay here tonight?

88
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,780
行  但我要去见伯纳黛特
Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette.

89
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,740
所以就你和我妈在家
It'll just be you and my mother.

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,150
我猜应该没事吧
I guess that's okay.

91
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,780
妈  拉杰能睡这儿吗
Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

92
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,990
行啊  他可以和我玩扮医生的游戏[doctor也有医生的意思]
Of course, he and I can play doctor!

93
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,100
她在开玩笑  对吧
She's kidding, right?

94
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,750
我不知道  自从接受荷尔蒙替换治疗之后
I don't know, she's pretty feisty since

95
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,780
她就变得精力充沛了
they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.

96
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,650
呼叫小可爱医生
Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,610
我不得不说  艾米  我对于
I must say, Amy, I was very impressed

98
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,940
伯纳黛特拿到博士学位感到非常惊讶
to see that Bernadette got her PhD.

99
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,390
确实令人钦佩
It's indeed admirable.

100
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,910
虽然  她是搞  微生物学的
Although, it is... microbiology.

101
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,090
你的博士学位是神经生物学的
Your doctorate is in neurobiology.

102
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,780
我看不出什么差别
I fail to see the distinction.

103
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,350
我就这么跟你说吧
I'll make it simple for you.

104
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,670
我研究的是大脑
I study the brain,

105
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,230
这是能让贝多芬写出《命运交响曲》的器官
the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

106
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,640
而伯纳黛特研究的是酵母菌
Bernadette studies yeast,

107
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,450
是用来制造Michelob Lite啤酒的有机体
the organism responsible for Michelob Lite.

108
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,260
你的脖子不舒服吗
Is there something wrong with your neck?

109
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,230
有点僵硬
It's a little stiff.

110
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,290
如此不堪一击的结构
What a remarkably fragile structure

111
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,900
却要支撑如此价值连城的设备
to support such a valuable payload.

112
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,380
这无异于用精灵粉末糖来支撑皇室珠宝彩蛋
Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.

113
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,870
你考虑过做个按摩吗
Have you considered massage?

114
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,150
我想用讽刺的口吻来回答你的问题
I'd like to respond to that sarcastically:

115
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,220
是的  让一个陌生人给我的身体涂油并按压
Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body

116
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,260
这个想法很不错
with oil and rubbing it.

117
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,130
我是建议你亲手对自己的肌肉进行按摩
I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.

118
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,760
那还是会涉及到很多不必要的触碰
Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.

119
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,670
相信我
Trust me.

120
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,690
伸出你的右手
With your right hand,

121
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,370
找到肩胛骨和肩峰的交界处
locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.

122
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,930
好了
All right.

123
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,610
然后用右手中指沿肩胛的突起进行按压
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade,

124
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,230
同时小幅度揉动
making a small rotation as you do so.

125
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,640
揉着呢
Rotating.

126
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,030
你应该能感觉到有一个突起的结构
You should feel a small node-like object

127
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,420
在沿着骨头前后滚动
rolling back and forth along the bone.

128
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,050
你是指肌筋膜点吗
You mean the myofascial point?

129
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,520
不然呢
Obviously.

130
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,410
接着向其施力
Now bear down on it

131
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,590
就像我们熟悉的七年级生
like the seventh grade noogies

132
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,300
欺负人用的经典按头动作
we all know too well.

133
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,660
额滴神啊  爽  爽  爽
Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes!

134
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,930
艾米  以前从来没人这么摸过我
Amy, I've never been touched like this before!

135
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,510
我的手简直是神来之手啊
Oh! My hands are magic!

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,900
别自吹自擂了
Don't flatter yourself.

137
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,250
你的手不过是在本人神经系统知识指导下的
Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge

138
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,930
一个愚钝的工具而已
of the nervous system.

139
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,520
我刚也可以轻易地让你瘫痪
I could just as easily have paralyzed you.

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,060
有人在敲门
There's someone at my door.

141
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,210
我对此不感兴趣  拜拜
That doesn't interest me. Good-bye.

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,680
-我能在这里过夜吗  -凭什么
- Can I sleep here tonight? - Why?

143
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,410
莱纳德正和我妹妹进行星际迷航式的性交
Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate

144
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,730
那从天文学角度来说很不科学
Star Trek sex with my sister.

145
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,250
的确很令人心烦意乱  进来吧
I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in.

146
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,220
我去拿铺在沙发上的床单和毯子
I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.

147
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,200
不用了  我去莱纳德的房间睡就行
Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

148
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,970
不行  我不能授权
No, I can't authorize that.

149
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,030
他能睡在我床上  我为啥不能睡在他床上
Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,800
汉谟拉比法典上规定可以"以眼还眼"
The Hammurabic Code is "an eye for an eye,"

151
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,390
而并非"以床还床"
not "a bed for a bed."

152
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,580
行行好  哥们  我快累死了
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,

153
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,400
提拉·班克斯说过
and Tyra Banks says
提拉·班克斯  美国著名模特

154

化妆包里最重要的一样东西
the most important item in your makeup bag

155
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,560
就是夜晚香甜的睡眠
is a good night's sleep.

156
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,040
好吧
All right.

157
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,800
要想使用"莱纳德的卧室"
This is a form indemnifying me

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,900
需要先签署这张我的免责表
from your use of "Leonard's bedroom."

159
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,400
在这里签字  说明我试图阻止过你
Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,430
并摆出过严厉的面部表情
and did so using a stern facial expression.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,360
-晚安  谢尔顿  -等等  还没完
- Good night, Sheldon.  - Wait. Not yet.

162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,020
我们还要重温一下安全规程
We still have to go over safety procedures.

163
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,220
这间公寓里共有三个紧急出口  分别在
Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located

164
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,030
这里  这里和这里
here, here, and here.

165
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,610
万一遇到停电事故
In the event of a power outage,

166
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,830
夜光漆可指引你从最近的出口逃生
luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.

167
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,580
开玩笑吧你
You're kidding.

168
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,580
在安全问题上  我从不儿戏
I never kid about safety.

169
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,210
你在我房间里干什么
What are you doing here?

170
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,300
睡觉啊
I was sleeping.

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,280
在我床上
In my bed?

172
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,620
我也想睡在自己的床上
Well, I would've slept in my own bed,

173
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,300
但它却用来给我的家庭带来耻辱
but it was being used to bring shame to my family.

174
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,380
吉恩·罗登贝瑞  《星际迷航》中的演员
还让我想起来了吉恩·罗登贝瑞
And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.

175
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,690
你听见了吗
Oh, you heard?

176
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,640
"史考特  我需要更多的能量"
"Scotty, I need more power."

177
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,910
抱歉  谢尔顿知道你睡在这里吗
Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?

178
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,850
怎么可能不知道  他逼我签了免责书
Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver,

179
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,970
参加了紧急消防演习
participate in an emergency fire drill

180
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,750
还复习了心脏复苏术的课程
and take a refresher course in CPR.

181
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,210
还好他有个人体模型
Thank God he had a dummy.

182
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,080
是啊  嘴对嘴的莫娜
Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

183
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,580
知道吗  她和霍华德谈过恋爱
You know, she used to date Howard?

184
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,640
天啊  她就是那个莫娜吗
Oh, my God, she's that Mona?

185
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,350
你和我妹妹为什么不能在这里共度春宵呢
Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?

186
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,490
我们试过  但是她和谢尔顿合不来
We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.

187
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,940
谢尔顿跟他自己都合不来
Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon.

188
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,410
但那也不足以说服我听你的话
It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you

189
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,330
每晚都要装备上光子鱼雷
arm your photon torpedoes every night.

190
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,260
好吧  不如这样
Okay, well, how about this:

191
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,930
在普丽娅找到自己的住处之前
until Priya gets her own place,

192
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,510
你住在这里  而我住在你家
you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.

193
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,350
我能带女孩过来吗
Can I bring girls here?

194
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,720
就凭你
You?

195
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,980
当然了  想带多少带多少
Sure. Bring as many as you want.

196
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,700
好的  就这么定了
Okay, deal.

197
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,410
别强迫她们就行了
Just not against their will.

198
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,410
你觉得吃那块蛋糕合适吗
You really think you should be eating that cake?

199
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,480
怎么了
Why?

200
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,370
鉴于你即将成为富婆的小白脸老公
If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife,

201
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,420
你可要注意自己的腰围啊
you might want to watch your waistline.

202
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,490
他说得对
He's right.

203
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,560
嘴上一时享受  臀上一世肥肉
A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.

204
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,730
是啊  真幽默
Yeah, ha-ha.

205
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,030
首先  我未婚妻的成功并没对我造成威胁
First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiance's success.

206
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,970
我为她感到骄傲
I'm proud of her.

207
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,720
其次  我拥有自己的事业
And secondly, I have my own career.

208
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,450
有了孩子可就不一样了

好消息  拉杰

我刚从实验室取回了你的血样报告

你可以在我家待上一段时间了
You're okay to stay for a while.

212
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,310
你什么时候帮我抽的血
When did you take my blood?

213
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,850
这不重要
Not important.

214
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,960
你血糖有点偏高

我会跟你医生保持联系的

同时  这里还有些文件

要请你过目
for you to go over.

218
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,690
这又是什么东东
What the hell is this?

219
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,250
都是些陈辞滥调啦
Boilerplate stuff.

This says you can make "end of life" decisions for me.

223

这就是单纯吃饭与用餐的区别

He's living at my place, so I'm living here.

270
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,340
你目前只是暂时住这
You're living here provisionally.

271
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,750
但我必须说  你干得不错
But I must say it's looking good.

272
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,670
莱纳德和普丽娅同居了
Leonard and Priya are living together?

273
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,520
这可是大事啊
That's big.

274
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,990
不  手工折的餐巾天鹅
No. Origami napkin swans...

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,620
这才是大事
that's the headline.

276
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,480
而且是好事
It's a good thing.

277
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,700
你知道在这个制药厂  你将从事
So do you know what kind of research you'll be doing

278
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,550
哪方面的研究吗
at this pharmaceutical company?

279
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,070
有很多种选择
Well, there are a couple of opportunities available,

280
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,160
但我自愿参加了早泄问题研究
but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project.

281
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,370
反正我们俩都没有心脏病
I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease.

282
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,730
差点忘了  我给你买了个小礼物
Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.

283
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,290
妮妮  你不用这样的
Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.

284
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,540
我想给你买嘛  来  打开看看
I wanted to. Come on, open it.

285
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,110
你给我买了块劳力士手表
You bought me a Rolex?

286
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,440
这得多少钱啊
How much did this cost?

287
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,220
让我来操心赚钱的事吧
Oh, you let me worry about the money.

288
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,710
我只想我的宝贝拥有漂亮东西
I just want my baby to have pretty things.

289
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,080
再来点酒吗
More wine?

290
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,170
不不不  我已经高了
Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.

291
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,590
关于酒  有个很有趣的事...
Here's an interesting fact about alcohol...

292
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,340
再给我满上
Hit me.

293
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,020
人类并不是唯一一个
Man is not the only species

294
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,190
会发酵水果酿酒的物种
that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated.

295
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,900
能猜到还有哪个物种也会吗
Can you guess what the other is?

296
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,410
提示  有时他们会把酒装进旅行箱[trunk也有象鼻的意思]
Hint: sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.

297
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,400
猴子
Monkeys.

298
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,350
猴子什么时候有旅行箱了
When does a monkey have a trunk?

299
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,150
当手提箱太小装不下酒时
When a suitcase just won't do.

300
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,500
好吧
Mmm, all right.

301
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,190
很快就知道酒精是不是
It would appear as if alcohol

302
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,210
正在将你的智力一步步夺走
is playing keep-away with your intelligence.

303
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,580
晚安
Good night.

304
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,880
请记住  已经10点多了
Please note, it is now past 10:00 p.m.

305
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,130
根据我们的室友协议  请好心避免
Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain

306
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,420
刺耳的笑声
from raucous laughter,

307
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,400
玻璃的叮当声和庆祝的炮火声
clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.

308
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,830
好吧
Okay...

309
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,790
请教一下
explain something to me.

310
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,390
你眼睁睁看着莱纳德忍受他一年又一年
You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years.

311
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,170
你脑子里哪根筋搭错  让你觉得
What has to break inside your brain for you to think,

312
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,170
"克利须那神  我也想被折磨一把"
"Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that"?

313
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,310
这比在自家公寓
Well, it's a lot better than having

314
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,830
戴着消音耳机强多了
to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.

315
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,870
什么  天啊  我懂我懂
What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

316
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,400
莱纳德在床上是个吵死人的小混蛋
Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.

317
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,530
-夜夜笙歌  -真的吗
- Every night. - Really?

318
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,540
即使在接吻和喘气都得轮流干的
Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate

319
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,570
过敏季节也这样吗
between kissing and breathing?

320
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,110
那是我妹妹  咱们就此打住行吗
It's my sister. Can we not talk about this anymore?

321
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,810
好  抱歉抱歉
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

322
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,390
我能告诉你个秘密吗
Can I tell you a secret?

323
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,370
行
Yeah.

324
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,040
是我搞砸了
I screwed up.

325
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,160
莱纳德是个好人
Leonard's a great guy.

326
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,470
我不应该跟他分手的
Never should have broken up with him.

327
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,510
其实应该是来自Alfred Lord Tennyson
我改编一下莎士比亚的话好了
Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare:

328
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,680
"爱过  失去过"
"It's better to have loved and lost
原话应该是It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

329
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,840
"总好过每晚在家"
"than to stay home every night

330
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,920
"下载日益下流的黄色图片"
and download increasingly shameful pornography."

331
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,570
你个可怜的小家伙
Ohh... you poor baby.

332
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,710
我这是什么毛病  佩妮
What's wrong with me, Penny?

333
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,100
没病  没病
Nothing, nothing.

334
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,620
如果我们不是朋友
You know, if we weren't friends,

335
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,010
如果你没提到那个恶心黄色图片小故事的话
and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story,

336
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,750
我肯定会爬到你身上
I'd be on you like

337
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,950
以光速平方进出身体  产生能量
the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.

338
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,890
哇  你居然完全懂啊
Hey, you totally got that right!

339
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,550
能量等于质量乘以光速的平方[爱因斯坦质能等价理论]
"E=mc2."

340
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,560
我听着呢
I listen.

341
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,030
虽然不知道什么意思  但我听着呢
I have no idea what it means, but I listen.

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,550
-致友谊  -致友谊
- To friendship. - To friendship.

343
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,750
你们俩酒鬼能别发出那种讨人厌的碰杯声吗
Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking?!

344
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,750
还有  答案是大象
And the answer was elephant!

345
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,780
莱纳德  亲爱的
Leonard, sweetheart,

346
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,360
我们是在接吻  不是在喝热汤
we're kissing, not eating hot soup.

347
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,990
抱歉
Sorry.

348
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,490
我父母要跟我视频通话
That's my parents on video chat.

349
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,540
快躲进卧室里
Go hide in the bedroom.

350
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,410
拜托
Oh, come on!

351
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,590
为什么不直接告诉他们  我们在约会呢
Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?

352
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,240
我们讨论过这个  现在还不是时候
Oh, we've been through this. It's not the time.

353
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,340
那何时才是时候
When is the time?

354
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,710
我有5个兄弟姐妹
I've got five brothers and sisters.

355
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,380
肯定会有其中一个闯大祸
One of them is bound to screw up real big,

356
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,230
到时候我就向我父母介绍你
and then I'll tell my parents about you.

357
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,850
-现在快闪  -好吧
- Now, shoo. - Fine.

358
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,730
你好  妈咪  你好  爹地
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

359
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,340
我们听说堪萨斯城有龙卷风
We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City.

360
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,630
那离你们近吗
Is that close to you?

361
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,190
不近
No.

362
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,700
你哥哥呢
Where is your brother?

363
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,010
跟朋友出去玩了
Out with friends.

364
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,460
我不喜欢这样  一个年轻姑娘独自在家
I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.

365
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,410
等你下个月搬回来后
I'll sleep so much better

366
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,230
我的睡眠质量肯定上升不少
when you move back here next month.

367
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,500
你要搬回印度
You're moving back to India?!

368
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,210
谁在那儿
Who's that?

369
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,310
天啊  你屋子里有别人
Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment.

370
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,380
快打电话给美国的警察
Call the police in America!

371
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,530
你打算什么时候告诉我这事
When were you going to tell me about this?

372
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,220
你好啊  莱纳德
Oh, hello, Leonard.

373
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,970
真是个意外的惊喜啊
What a pleasant surprise!

374
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,530
妈咪爹地  你还记得拉杰的朋友莱纳德吧
Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.

375
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,050
我以为你说拉杰跟朋友出去玩了
I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.

376
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,020
他有很多朋友  好不好
He has many friends.

377
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,190
拉杰居然有很多朋友
Rajesh has many friends?

378
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,600
你为什么要对我们撒谎
Why are you lying to us?

379
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,260
她撒谎是因为她不想告诉你们
She's lying because she doesn't want you to know

380
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,600
-我们在约会  -莱纳德
- we're dating. - Leonard!

381
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,430
现在还有什么区别吗
Well, what difference does it make?

382
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,970
如果你回印度  我们肯定是要分手的
If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.

383
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,020
那啥  我现在不想讨论这个问题
You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.

384
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,330
所以说
So...

385
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,300
印度很热吧
Hot in India?

386
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,790
当然是  一直是  这可是印度
Of course it is. It always is. It's India.

387
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,060
现在你有什么好说的
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?

388
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,010
你们家的挂毯真漂亮
That is a beautiful tapestry.

389
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,430
天啊
Oh, God.

390
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,220
上帝啊
Oh, God!

391
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,770
你给我听着
Okay, look.

392
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,010
这事从没发生过
This never happened.

393
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,680
明白吗
Do you understand me?

394
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,630
搞毛啊  都这样了还不敢跟姐说话
Really?! Still can't talk to me?

395
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,240
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

396
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,880
什么
What?

397
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,720
我问  你在这儿干嘛
I said, what are you doing here?

398
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,770
我住这儿
I live here.

399
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,390
我的文件可不是这么说的
I have paperwork that says differently.

400
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,140
普丽娅要回印度了
Priya's going back to India.

401
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,320
这是两码事
Irrelevant.

402
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,660
拉杰和我相处得很融洽
Rajesh and I have a good thing going

403
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,850
你不能就这么毁掉它
and you're not going to ruin it.

404
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,850
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

405
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,530
我一宿没睡
I've been up all night.
