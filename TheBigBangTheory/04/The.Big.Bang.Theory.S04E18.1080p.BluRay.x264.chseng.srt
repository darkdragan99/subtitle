1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,890
早啊
Morning.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,400
早
Morning.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,970
睡得好吗
Sleep okay?

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,540
挺好的
Mm-hmm. Great.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,310
我能问你点儿事儿吗
Hey, can I ask you something?

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,630
问吧
Sure.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,390
昨晚我想尝试《性爱宝典》
Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,850
里面的那招
of the Kama Sutra,

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,910
你是觉得有意思呢  还是觉得有种族歧视
was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,110
就因为你和一位印度女人同床共枕
Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman,

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,580
你就觉得可以
you think that gives you permission

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,470
使用古印度性爱手册里的狂野体位了吗
to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,090
喂  你要是能找到一本
Hey, if you can find a book called

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,950
《与白人男孩儿的诡异性爱》  我也没意见
Weird Sex With White Boys, I'd be okay with that.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,620
别戴  你的眼睛这么美
No, no, you have such beautiful eyes.

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,120
你考虑过戴隐形眼镜吗
Have you ever thought about getting contacts?

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,600
我七年级的时候试过
I tried in the seventh grade.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,000
总是戴不习惯
I could never get used to them.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
真是可惜
Oh, that's too bad.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,290
对啊  要是我戴上隐形眼镜  我肯定就是
Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,920
史上最酷的被关在
the coolest debate club president

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,750
自己大提琴箱里的辩论俱乐部主席了
ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,990
你要是现在戴上
If you had them on now,

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,630
就能看见咱们接下来要做啥了
you could see what we're going to do next.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,440
没  没关系的  我可以脑补的
Th-that's okay. I can infer from context.

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,480
嗨  拉杰  想见识一下我最近练的小魔术吗
Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,260
霍华德  容我插句嘴
Howard, if I may interject here

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,920
给你一条友情建议
with a piece of friendly advice.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,010
难道你的人生
Is working on magic tricks

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,260
就指着这些魔术小把戏了吗
really how you want to spend your time?

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,770
我知道你只是个工程师  但是
Granted, you're just an engineer, but...

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,010
这并不意味着你不会某天做出一个小把戏
that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,980
或者小玩意儿能让别人在诺贝尔奖的
or a thingamabob that may get you a "thank you"

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,560
获奖演说里送你一句"感谢某人"呀
in someone else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,910
你这魔术能把他变没了吗
Is the trick making him disappear?

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,460
好吧  咱们看看吧
Sure, let's see it.

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,380
给  洗一下牌
Here, shuffle these.

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,220
好
Okay.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,170
正面朝下  摊在桌子上
Now spread them out on the table face down.

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,880
挑一张  看一眼
Pick one, look at it.

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,820
好的
Okay.

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,890
记住这张牌  再把它放回去
Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.

43
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,450
知道为啥他拿不到博士学位了吧
Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,680
提醒我一下  你生日是哪天
Remind me, what's your birthday?

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,180
10月6号
October sixth.

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,330
好的  10月是第10个月份
Okay, October is the tenth month.

47
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,790
那么10  1加0等于1  1加6等于7
So ten-- one plus zero is one, plus six is seven.

48
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,410
翻开第7张牌
Turn over the seventh card.

49
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,100
我勒个去!
How about that!

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,080
是你选的那张牌吗
Is that your card?

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,180
对  没错  真厉害
Yes, it is. Very cool!

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,390
一点都不厉害
It's not cool.

53
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,640
只是个简单的用来
It's a childish trick designed

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,800
戏弄傻瓜的小把戏而已
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
你是咋弄的
How'd you do it?

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,590
魔术师是不会透露他的秘密的
A magician never reveals his secrets.

57
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,940
但未来的诺奖得主肯定能搞明白的
But surely a future Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

58
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,780
好啊
Fine.

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,540
让我想想
Give me a second.

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,650
你有没有注意到  每次他认真思考时都会散发培根的味道
You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?

61
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,640
-喂  -不好意思
- Oh, hey! - Sorry! Oop!

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,550
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry! Pardon me!

63
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,180
真不好意思
Oh, I'm so sorry!

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,170
都怪我
Oh, that was my fault.

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,330
看吧
Check it out.

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,520
我戴隐形了
I just got contacts.

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,510

生活大爆炸第四季第十八集

72
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,800
一  二
One, two,

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,080
三  四  五
three, four, five.

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,190
不可能吧
No way.

75
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,040
这张牌就是你挑的  对吧
That's your card, right?

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,320
草花7
Seven of clubs!

77
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,650
太神奇了
That is amazing!

78
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,150
一点都不神奇
It's not amazing.

79
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,170
魔术小把戏都离不开
All magic tricks are merely a combination

80
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,400
操纵和误导的窠臼
of manipulation and misdirection

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,830
有时候还会有侏儒藏在箱子里晃腿
with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.

82
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,020
哦  真的吗  那我是怎么做到的
Oh, really? So how did I do it?

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,360
我才不在乎你是怎么做到的
I don't care how you did it.

84
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,410
有更重要的问题等着我思考
I have more important things to think about.

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,770
显然这些牌上都是有记号的
Clearly, the cards are marked.

86
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,730
我以为你在思考更重要的事儿呢
I thought you had more important things to think about.

87
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,330
没错  你恰好
I do. You just happened

88
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,320
碰见我休息了
to have caught me on a break.

89
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,240
让我看看这些牌
Oh, let me see those cards.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,780
有啥大不了的  不知道
Big deal. Not knowing

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,880
才有乐趣啊
is part of the fun.

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,910
"不知道才有乐趣啊"
"Not knowing is part of the fun."

93
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,350
这是你们社区大学的校训吗
Was that the motto of your community college?

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,100
各位  你们觉得咋样
Hey, guys, what do you think?

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,570
普丽娅带我去买衣服了
Priya took me clothes shopping.

96
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,060
哇  看起来真不错
Hey, you look great.

97
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,960
干得好  普丽娅
Good for you, Priya.

98
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,470
我怎么样都没法让他不穿那件难看的帽衫
I could never get that stupid hoodie off him

99
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,800
在我俩还那啥的时候
when we were...

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,240
额  你看起来好帅
Well, you look great.

101
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,030
多谢
Thank you.

102
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,130
咱去把衣服都挂起来吧
Let's go hang everything up.

103
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,610
嗯  好
Yeah, good.

104
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,970
新隐形眼镜
New contacts.

105
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,150
我该早几年戴的
I should have done this years ago.

106
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,960
这么说你终于习惯他俩每天都这样了
So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,860
我已经不和他在一起了
I'm not going out with him.

108
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,500
他想跟谁上床都无所谓
He can sleep with whoever he wants.

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,940
我在和拉杰说话呢
Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,820
啊哦
Oopsy.

111
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
这副牌肯定做了手脚
This deck is rigged in some fashion.

112
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,830
好吧  换一副牌
Fine. Get another deck

113
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,790
我照样能变给你看
and I'll do the trick with that.

114
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,240
你是说这是一副正常的牌吗
So you're saying this is a regulation deck?

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,660
我是说要相信魔法  你个麻瓜
I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.

116
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,100
我很高兴莱纳德找到了女友
You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone.

117
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,090
虽然没人问起这个
Not that anybody asked.

118
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,710
你有多少件星际迷航的制服
How many <i>Star Trek</i> uniforms do you have?

119
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,840
就两件
Just two:

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,420
常服和礼服各一
everyday and dress.

121
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,460
我们得谈谈
Listen, we need to talk about something.

122
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,500
天哪  你是要跟我分手
Oh, my God, you're breaking up with me!

123
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,830
为什么要带我去买衣服
Why would you take me out shopping

124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,610
然后跟我分手  那太残忍了
and then break up with me? That is so cruel!

125
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,090
莱纳德  我不是要跟你分手
Leonard, I'm not breaking up with you.

126
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,480
哦  好吧
Oh, okay.

127
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,270
那你要谈什么
So, what's up?

128
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,330
我就觉得怪怪的
It's a little weird,

129
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,340
你前女友一天到晚在这玩
your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.

130
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,940
我知道
I know.

131
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,770
我通常跟前女友老死不相往来
I usually never see my ex-girlfriends,

132
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,870
除非她们的硬盘崩溃
unless their hard drives crash.

133
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,900
我只是说  要是我整天
I'm just saying, how would you feel

134
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,320
跟前男友混在一块  你觉得怎样
if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?

135
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,770
不怎么好  我想
Um, not great, I guess.

136
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,410
但我和佩妮现在只是朋友
But Penny and I are just friends.

137
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,510
我不管
I don't care.

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,690
她曾跟你上过床
This is a woman you have slept with.

139
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,800
要是你仍想她在眼前晃
If you want her around,

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,200
那我不得不认为你仍对她旧情难忘
then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,050
不  不不  我忘了
No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

142
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,890
我都为了你宁愿目不能视
I gave up the gift of sight for you.

143
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,930
这还不算忘了旧情  算什么
If that's not moving on, what is?

144
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,870
我想让你跟佩妮彻底断了
You need to cut the cord with Penny.

145
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,920
哦  好的
Oh... okay.

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,910
你好像不是很有信心
You don't sound very confident.

147
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,750
不  不  我很有信心
No, no, I'm confident.

148
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,570
我很清楚什么叫"我要跟你一刀两断"
Its not like I'm unfamiliar with the "get lost" conversation.

149
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,530
虽然  这是第一次我跟人这么说
Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.

150
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,550
谢谢你
Thank you.

151
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,920
-我很感激  -应该的
- I appreciate it. - Sure.

152
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,090
天哪  你真香
Oh, God, you smell so good.

153
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,050
当然  也有可能是
Of course, that could just be

154
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,370
我其他感官更加灵敏了
my other senses getting stronger.

155
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,720
假设  我能弄到
Hypothetically, if I had access
《星际迷航》角色  女性

156
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,250
一件乌胡拉中尉的制服  你会穿吗
to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?

157
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,320
莱纳德  这是我和我家人莫大的痛苦
Leonard, it's a source of great pain to me and my family

158
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360
因为我哥衣柜居然有这一套行头
that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,150
能不讨论这个吗
Can we not discuss it?

160
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,900
抱歉  别介意
I'm sorry. Never mind.

161
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,240
你之前拿的牌就是方块J吗
And was your card the jack of diamonds?

162
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,910
难以置信
Oh, unbelievable!

163
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,540
知道他怎么做到的了吗
Know how he did it yet?

164
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,910
嗷  他跟我小侄子一个表情
Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets

165
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,980
他想不通为何我鼻子跟他一样时就这样
when he can't figure out how I got his nose.

166
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,040
我还有几个治愈系的小魔术
You know, I have some remedial magic tricks

167
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,620
可能更适合你
that might be more your speed.

168
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,660
比如  快看
Like, ooh, look!

169
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,820
看这铅笔上的橡皮
The pencil's rubber!

170
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,060
我想我知道你怎么变的了
Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.

171
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,250
拜托  我都不明白  你怎么可能知道
Oh, please, if I don't know, you don't know.

172
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,400
这是不言自明的
That's axiomatic.

173
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,570
我说给你听
Come here.

174
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,670
还真给你说对了
You're right.

175
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,990
对一个不知道什么叫
Not too bad for someone

176
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,300
"不言自明"的人来说  还真不赖
who doesn't know what "axiomatic" means.

177
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,520
你的隐形眼镜呢
What happened with the contacts?

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,780
一个在楼上
One of them's upstairs.

179
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,440
另一个好像已经跑脑袋里了
The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.

180
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,860
这是普丽娅给你买的新衬衫吗
Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?

181
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,150
对
Yeah.

182
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,820
可不能这么洗
You don't wanna wash that.

183
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,680
-不能吗  -不能  这是丝织品
- No? - No, that's silk.

184
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,360
老实说  没有我你可怎么办哦
Seriously, what would you do without me?

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,930
是啊
Yeah.

186
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,170
我不得不说  我觉得
You know, I gotta tell you, I think

187
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,290
-你找上普丽娅真是太幸运了  -我也这么想
- you got a real winner with Priya. - Yeah, me, too.

188
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,660
她真是太可爱了
She seems really sweet.

189
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
相信我  你可不能觉得理所当然
Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted.

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,700
外面可有大堆大堆的婊子
There are a lot of bitches out there.

191
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,120
是啊  找个婊子可就太糟了
Yeah, bitches are the worst.

192
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,750
好了  回见
All right, I'll see you later.

193
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,570
佩妮  我有事想跟你说
Uh, Penny, there's something I have to tell you.

194
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,230
什么
What?

195
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,330
好吧  怎么说呢
Okay, uh, how do I put this?

196
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,960
你了解达尔文在加拉帕戈斯群岛
Um... are you familiar with Darwin's observation

197
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,580
考察雀类时的观察法吗
of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?

198
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,330
有拍电影出来吗
Did they make a movie about it?

199
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:26,930
没有
No.

200
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,240
那我不了解
Then no.

201
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,750
好吧  达尔文观察到当两组雀类
All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups

202
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,050
去竞争同一种食物来源
of finches competed over the same food source,

203
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,410
最终  其中一种会进化出不同的鸟嘴
eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape

204
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,680
从而能以别的东西为食
so they could feed on something else.

205
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,050
好吧
Okay.

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,850
你觉得我们可以从该行为中学到什么
So what do you think we can learn from that behavior

207
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,880
可以运用于自己生活中的
that we can apply to our own lives?

208
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,510
一鸟在手  胜过二鸟在林?
Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?

209
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,020
当然  这话里也有鸟
Sure, that has birds in it.

210
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,330
跟你说话真有趣  莱纳德  总学得到东西
It's fun talking to you, Leonard; I always learn stuff.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
抱歉  那就算你答应了
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.

212
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,010
你睡觉的时候一定要戴这玩意吗
Do you really have to wear that in bed?

213
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,620
对呀  医生怕我睡着之后揉眼睛
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night.

214
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,320
不戴这个  就要戴那种超大的锥形颈圈
It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.

215
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,630
你跟佩妮谈过了吗
So did you get to talk to Penny?

216
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,890
谈了  真的  谈了
Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.

217
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,180
结果呢
And?

218
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,810
她毫无保留地欣然接受了
She completely understood everything I said.

219
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,630
妥妥儿的
Case closed.

220
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,820
她生气了吗
Was she upset?

221
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,910
也许吧  不过与我无关
Maybe, but that's not my problem.

222
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,510
她不是我女朋友  你才是
She's not my girlfriend, you are.

223
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,630
不要对她太残忍
I hope you weren't cruel to her.

224
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,890
那让繁花凋零的到底是秋天的残忍
Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die,

225
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,950
还是自然法则呢
or is that just nature's way?

226
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,620
莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?

227
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,400
干嘛
What?!

228
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,690
我参透沃罗威茨的小魔术了
I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick,

229
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,890
我需要你来选一张牌
and I need you to pick a card.

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,970
我不会给你开门的  谢尔顿
I am not opening that door, Sheldon!

231
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,580
如你所愿
As you wish.

232
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,630
选一张牌  放回去
Pick a card, put it back,

233
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,960
接下来就是见证奇迹的时刻
and prepare to be amazed.

234
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,380
选好了吗
Did you pick one?

235
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,900
好了
Yep.

236
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,960
这是你选的牌吗
Is this your card?

237
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,730
不是
Nope.

238
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,490
我去
Drat.

239
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,710
这张呢
Is this your card?

240
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,140
不是
No.

241
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,310
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

242
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,370
选一张牌  谢尔顿
Pick a card, Sheldon.

243
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,170
瞟一眼  然后放回去
Now look at it, and put it back in the deck.

244
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,660
记住牌面了吗
Now do you remember your card?

245
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,410
搞笑呢吧  哥的记忆力不是讲笑的
Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory.

246
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,150
我的错
My apologies.

247
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,020
现在洗一下牌
Now shuffle the cards.

248
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,530
接着洗
Shuffling.

249
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,220
等我一下
Wait here.

250
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,290
图像处理  交叉引证
Processing image, cross-referencing...

251
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,230
忙什么呢
Whatcha doin'?

252
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,570
我在对沃罗威茨的小魔术进行逆向分析
I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.

253
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,340
红外摄像机能派上什么用场
What's up with the infrared cameras?

254
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,220
通过对扑克牌余热等级的测量
I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards

255
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,490
可以确定哪张牌被摸过了
to determine which one's been touched.

256
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,470
顺便提醒一下
By the way,

257
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,530
如果你打算要小宝宝的话
if you hope to have children,

258
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,940
我建议你把三角小内内换成四角的
I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers.

259
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,380
你的蛋蛋看上去温度略高
Your testicles look a tad warm.

260
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,060
我勒个去  别告诉我你进入了
Holy crap, are you connected

261
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,200
国立橡树岭研究所的系统
to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?

262
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,620
没错  我正在用他们的克雷超级电脑
Yes. I'm using their Cray supercomputer

263
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,790
分析洗牌的模式
to analyze shuffling patterns.

264
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,940
谢尔顿  那台电脑是供国防部使用的
Sheldon, that computer is used for national defense.

265
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,860
黑进去相当于刑事犯罪
Hacking into it is a federal crime.

266
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,710
别紧张  现在又没人跟咱们打仗
Relax, we're not under attack right now.

267
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,720
趁军方直升机没来之前我先出去躲躲
Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.

268
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,330
这张会是我的牌吗
And is this my card?

269
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,630
大爷的
Rats!

270
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,600
我怀疑霍华德用了放射性指示剂
I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer.

271
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,390
这么晚了我上哪弄铀-235去啊
Where am I going to find uranium-235 this time of night?

272
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,240
给力吧  Craigslist
Come on, CraigsList.
Craigslist  一个网上大型免费分类广告网站

273
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,020
带你来印度餐厅算是种族歧视吗
Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?

274
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,750
没关系  我喜欢印度菜
It's okay, I like Indian food.

275
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,970
或者你可以宾至如归地称它为"菜"
Or as you probably call it back home, "food."

276
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,500
你为什么不戴隐形眼镜了
Why didn't you wear your contacts?

277
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,350
不喜欢吗
Don't you like them?

278
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,360
不  不  我喜欢
No, no, I do.

279
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,550
只是我知道今晚要吃咖喱
It's just I knew I was having curry tonight

280
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,080
一个部位的灼痛就够我应付的了
and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.

281
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,440
知道吗
You know...

282
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,310
公司向我提供了一个职位  就在洛杉矶
...my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.

283
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,620
那意味着你会在这里定居了吗
Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently?

284
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,310
也许吧  你觉得怎样
Maybe. What do you think?

285
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,920
双手赞成
I love it.

286
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,830
太棒了
That's great!

287
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,820
吃着呢
Hi!

288
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,690
等我一下
Hi! Just hang on.

289
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,120
世界真小啊
Small world.

290
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,150
你根本没跟她谈过对吧
You did talk to her, didn't you?

291
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,780
当然谈了  我跟她谈啊谈啊谈啊的
Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.

292
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,090
莱纳德  瞧你这一身像模像样的成年人打扮
Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes.

293
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,540
有你的  普丽娅  这是他第一次
Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look

294
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,450
打扮得不像男孩服装部的模特
like a mannequin in the boys' department.

295
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,550
他有没有告诉你
Hey, did he

296
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,640
我挽救了那件真丝衬衫
tell you I saved the silk shirt?

297
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,720
没有啊
No, he did not.

298
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,270
他当时正准备把它扔进洗衣机
He was gonna throw it in the washing machine

299
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,700
和他的蜘蛛侠小内内一起洗呢
with his Spiderman underwear.

300
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,830
这就是咱家莱尼哈
That's our Lenny, huh?

301
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,250
对  这就是咱家莱尼
Yes, that's our Lenny.

302
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,810
这里的东西好吃吗
So how's the food here?

303
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,920
这个真的非常非常好吃
Oh, wow, that is really, really good.

304
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,580
抱歉  你们俩约着会呢
Oh, I'm sorry. You guys are on a date.

305
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,900
咱们有空再聚  吃好喝好
We can hang out anytime. Have fun.

306
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,390
拜拜  晚安
Bye. Good night.

307
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,460
辣死了  辣死了  辣死了
Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

308
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,750
是不是有被我盯梢的感觉
Whoo! I really sneaks up on ya, huh?

309
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,970
好了  我消失
All right, I gotta go.

310
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,900
这个真的很辣
It is pretty spicy.

311
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,210
我一直想告诉你来着
Oh, I've been meaning to tell you,

312
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,640
你的小魔术我弄明白了
I figured out your magic trick.

313
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
真的吗
Really?

314
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,040
那当然
Oh, yes.

315
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,640
而且我还进行了改进
In fact, I improved upon it.

316
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,640
我很期待啊
I'd love to see that.

317
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,110
你呢  拉杰
How about you, Raj?

318
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,410
边吃牛肉通心粉  边看表演
Beefaroni <i>and</i> a show?

319
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,950
怎么可能拒绝呢
How do you turn that down?

320
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,490
看好咯
All right.

321
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,920
选张牌
Pick a card.

322
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,690
好的
Okay.

323
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,300
天灵灵地灵灵  扑克牌快显灵
Bippity-boppity-boo.

324
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,370
你拿根小黑棒  哔一下是什么意思
What's with the wand and the beep?

325
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,380
小黑棒是用来凸显我的表演能力
The wand is called showmanship,

326
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,780
那哔的一声则不关你事
and the beep is none of your business.

327
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,860
抱歉
Oh! Excuse me.

328
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,180
我刚收到一则
I'm getting a text message

329
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,370
跟这魔术没半点关系的短信
completely unrelated to this magic trick.

330
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,450
我的衣服干洗完了
Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready.

331
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,000
你手里那张牌是黑桃5
And your card was the five of spades.

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,960
看吧
Ta-da.

333
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,070
这些牌上有条形码
These cards have barcodes on them.

334
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,280
那根小黑棒是读码器
The wand is a reader.

335
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,370
能把信息传送到你手机上
It's transmitting to your phone.

336
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,830
我刚说了  "看吧"
I said, "ta-da."

337
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,670
看完就得了
Show's over.

338
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,350
这也太悲剧了
That's pathetic.

339
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,980
哥给你演示一下  真正的魔术师是怎么做的
Let me show you how a real magician does it.

340
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,240
拉杰  选张牌
Raj, take a card.

341
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,960
不要让我看见
Don't let me see it.

342
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,030
好的
Okay.

343
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,230
梅花3
Three of clubs.

344
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,390
真他妈给力
Son of a gun,

345
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,680
大师果然是大师
you're blowing my mind!

346
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,720
天灵灵地灵灵  大师给你来显灵
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

347
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,440
我受够了  我要去搞点铀
That does it. I'm getting uranium.

348
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,960
你打算告诉他吗
You ever gonna tell him?

349
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,870
或许吧  等哪天玩腻了再说
Maybe. When it stops being fun.

350
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,800
那就是永远也不说咯
So never.

351
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,260
我刚准备去上班
Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.

352
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,550
没事  这事不重要
Oh, okay, its not important.

353
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,330
以后再说吧
It can wait.

354
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,040
没关系  边下楼边说吧
No, it's all right. Walk me down.

355
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,330
什么事
So, what's up?

356
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,200
我遇到一个难题
Uh, I kind of have a problem

357
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,830
希望你能帮我解决
I was hoping you could help me with.

358
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,030
当然  尽管说吧
Sure, anything.

359
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,770
搬出去
Move out.

360
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,570
什么
What?

361
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,030
不用搬太远
Not far.

362
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,580
如果你想组建家庭
Hey, if you ever wanna start a family,

363
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,380
拉肯纳达那边有一些不错的学校[美国加州]
La Canada has some great schools.

364
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,770
够了  我哪儿也不去
Okay, I'm not moving anywhere.

365
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,580
这到底是因为什么
What the hell is this all about?

366
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,960
为什么就一定要有原因吗
Why does it have to be about anything?

367
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,020
一个人请求他的伙伴搬家
Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate,

368
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,930
就不能毫无疑问地走吗
no questions asked?

369
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,150
看在上帝的份上  莱纳德
Oh, for God's sake, Leonard,

370
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,730
这是因为普丽娅  对吗
this is about Priya, isn't it?

371
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,360
她不想我老跟你一起玩
She doesn't want me hanging out with you.

372
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,300
对  就是这句  我终于说出口了
Yes. There, I said it.

373
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,040
好吧  听着
Okay, look.

374
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,930
我碰巧喜欢你的女朋友
I happen to like your girlfriend.

375
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,130
她也喜欢你
And she likes you.

376
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:15,840
不  她不喜欢我
No, she doesn't.

377
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,390
是不怎么喜欢
Not really, no.

378
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,500
没关系  我保证从今以后
It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on

379
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,010
我会跟你保持距离
I will keep my distance from you.

380
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,240
呃  先等等
Well, now, hold on.

381
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,020
你说的距离是指哪种
What kind of distance are we talking about?

382
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,220
因为我们是邻居
Because we are neighbors.

383
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,240
我可是那种能听见你公寓马桶冲水声的邻居
I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.

384
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,220
你还能听见我的马桶冲水声
You can hear my toilet flush?

385
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,850
我不是故意去听  不过很高兴知道
I don't listen for it, but it's nice to know

386
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,950
你的排水管道一切都好
everything's okay with your plumbing.

387
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,090
还有这栋楼的排水管道
The building's plumbing.

388
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,800
莱纳德  我懂的
Leonard, I get it.

389
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,010
你现在处于一段新的恋爱
You're in a new relationship now.

390
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,130
我为你感到高兴
And I'm happy for you.

391
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,270
为什么我们不能握个手  好聚好散呢
So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?

392
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,860
呃  先等等
Well, now hold on.

393
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,130
这样如何
How about this?

394
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,610
我们还可以一起玩  不过是地下的
How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?

395
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,400
你真的是那种人吗
Are you really that kind of guy?

396
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
不是
No.

397
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,300
其实当我说出"地下"这词儿的时候  我觉得有点犯傻
I actually felt kinda silly just saying "on the down-low."

398
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,980
再见  莱纳德
Good-bye, Leonard.

399
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,450
佩妮  等等
Penny, wait.

400
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,580
去你的隐形眼镜
Damn contacts.

401
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,340
他来了
Incoming.

402
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,830
-嗨  -嘿
- Hi! - Hey!

403
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,330
你们好
Hello.

404
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,930
为什么这么闷闷不乐  哥们儿
Why so glum, chum?

405
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,440
显然  你不能在美国国家安全局
Apparently, you can't hack into a government supercomputer

406
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,240
给你妈妈打小报告的情况下
and then try to buy uranium

407
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,030
入侵政府的超级电脑
without the Department of Homeland Security tattling

408
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,740
还试图在上面买铀
to your mother.

409
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,790
这真是太糟糕了
Oh, that's too bad.

410
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,040
想明白这魔术的原理了吗
Figure out the magic trick yet?

411
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
想明白这狗屁魔术的原理了吗
Figure out the magic trick yet?

412
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,590
要我来告诉你怎么做到的吗
Want me to tell you how to do it?

413
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,260
不用
No.

414
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,880
哥再给你耍一次
I'll show you one more time.

415
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,810
拉杰
Raj?

416
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,990
慢着
Hang on.

417
