1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,960
神啊  我一直怀疑你的存在  你为何抛弃我
Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,290
拿着  往袋子里呼气
Here. Breathe into this bag.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,760
出什么事了
What's going on?

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,430
被他们扒得光光的啊  莱纳德
They stole everything, Leonard!

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,900
一点不剩
Everything.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,630
你是他室友吗
Are you the roommate?

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,700
对  莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德  怎么了
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,940
你朋友报警说自己被盗了
Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,870
哦天呐  他们偷走了啥
Oh, my God, what did they get?

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,180
你该问他们没偷走啥
What didn't they get?

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,110
偷走了我的附魔武器
They got my enchanted weapons,

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,080
我的邪恶角斗士盔甲
my vicious gladiator armor,

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,420
我的纯净力量之杖
my wand of untainted power,

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,980
还有全部的金币
and all my gold!

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,190
你居然就因为
You called the police

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,990
有人黑掉了你的魔兽世界账号就报警了
because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,430
我还能怎么办
What choice did I have?

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,590
谢耳朵大侠  85级的血精灵
The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf,

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,400
东部王国的英雄
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,600
像烈日下的尸骸一样被扒光了
has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun.

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,600
另外  联邦调查局挂了我的电话
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,110
往袋子里呼吸
Into the bag.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,410
他们还偷走了我的作战陆行鸟
They took my battle ostrich!

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,750
-哦不会吧  别偷格兰啊  -是啊
- Oh, no, not Glenn! - Yes!

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,120
格兰
Glenn!

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,280
我唯一深爱的鸟啊
The only bird I ever loved.

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,590
保重了各位
Good luck, fellas.

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,290
谢谢你  警官
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,560
等一等
Wait a minute!

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,060
你难道就这么放任不管吗
You're not going to do anything?

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,230
库珀先生  我无能...
Mr. Cooper, there's nothing...

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,730
是库珀博士
Dr. Cooper.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
不是开玩笑吧
Seriously?

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,170
他不是那种贩毒的博士
Not the kind with access to drugs.

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,140
好吧  库珀博士
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,570
我对你的损失深表遗憾
I'm sorry for your loss,

37
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,110
但帕萨迪纳警局
but the Pasadena Police Department

38
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,340
的管辖权并不在
doesn't have jurisdiction in...

39
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,240
潘多拉
Pandora.

40
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,910
你说的那是《阿凡达》
That's from Avatar

41
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,250
魔兽世界可是在艾泽拉斯啊
World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth.

42
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,120
我的亲娘七舅老爷  你是怎么有资格配枪的
Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun?

43
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,260
你起码能给我推荐一位被开除的警察吧
Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?

44
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,590
什么
What?

45
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,400
就是  那种因为拒绝墨守陈规
Wh-- you know, one who was drummed off the force

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,230
而被开除的警察
because he refused to play by the rules,

47
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,930
现在致力于
and now he hires himself out

48
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
用自己的残酷方式伸张正义
to impose his own brand of rough justice?

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,870
没有
No.

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,940
多谢了  警官
Thank you, officer.

51
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,450
全没了  全没了啊
It's all gone. <i>All</i> gone.

52
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,310
我真的很遗憾  谢尔顿
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.

53
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,980
这是个什么世道啊
What kind of world do we live in,

54
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,950
一个人可以随便抢走另一个人的作战陆行鸟
where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,820
我不知道
I don't know.

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,190
这种野蛮行径必须
This act of aggression must be met

57
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,560
以牙还牙以血还血
with swift and cruel ferocity.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,200
大声疾呼的时刻到了  让我们释放战争恶魔吧
It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,370
我这就去
I'm on it.

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,470
你好  沃罗威茨夫人  霍华德在家吗
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there?

61
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,640
好的  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,140
那只战争恶魔
That particular dog of war

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,250
会在洗完澡以后回你电话
will have to call you back after his bath.

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,180
我看看拉杰有没有练完普拉提
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

65
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,310

生活大爆炸第四季第十九集

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
三千个小时
Three thousand hours.

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,500
点了三千个小时的鼠标啊
Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse,

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,470
就为了收集武器和金币
collecting weapons and gold.

73
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,370
差一点就全是浪费时间了
It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,970
不管是谁干的  他肯定早有准备
Whoever did this knew what they were doing.

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,010
他在15分钟内登入登出了
He got in and out of your account in under

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,510
你的账号  其间弄走了你的全部物品
15 minutes, transferred all your stuff,

77
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,740
而且还没留下一丝的电子指纹
and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.

78
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,010
噢
Oh!

79
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,550
即使饮尽全世界的黄春菊茶[能稳定情绪]
There isn't enough chamomile tea in the world

80
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,450
也不能平息我心中的怒火
to quell the rage in my heart.

81
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,150
等下  我在雷霆崖的桥下
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

82
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,720
跟一位兽人聊天
under the bridge in Thunder Bluff

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,560
他说只要我们肯出钱  他能帮我们找到你的东西
who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,060
他可信吗
Can we trust him?

85
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,390
我觉得挺可信的  他似乎是
I should say so; he appears to be a member

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,900
尼日利亚的一位皇室成员
of the Nigerian royal family.

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,270
哇  有人在拍卖一个镶了宝石陆行鸟缰绳
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jeweled ostrich bridle!

88
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,400
不是  格兰的缰绳是皮革的
No. Glenn's was leather.

89
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,440
他以前是只很平凡的陆行鸟
He was a simple ostrich.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,440
现在也是  现在也是  我还没放弃希望
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,210
嗨
Hey.

92
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,450
嗨  佩妮  我们现在正忙着处理些麻烦事
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.

93
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,820
我知道  伯纳黛特告诉我了
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

94
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,150
不好意思啊谢尔顿  我知道那个游戏对你来说意义非凡
Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,220
神马  "那个游戏"
What-- "that game"?

96
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,160
很抱歉佩妮  涂鸦跳跃是个游戏
Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game.

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,830
愤怒的小鸟也是个游戏
Angry Birds is a game.

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,330
魔兽世界是一款
World of Warcraft is a

99
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,470
大规模  多玩家的在线角色扮演
massively multi-player online role-playing...

100
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,400
好吧  严格来讲  也算是游戏
all right, technically it's a game.

101
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,870
坏消息  那个尼日利亚王子可能是个骗子
Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

102
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,110
好吧  总而言之  我带了个
Okay, well, anyways, I brought you

103
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,680
昨天出炉的芝士蛋糕来安慰你
a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,250
对一个失去陆行鸟的人来说
Stale pastry is hollow succor

105
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,720
一个不新鲜的蛋糕顶毛用呀
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,020
说"谢谢"就好了
Just say "thank you".

107
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,590
我刚才说的不就是这意思嘛
I thought I just did.

108
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,420
好吧  回见
All right. See you later.

109
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,520
你好
Oh! Hello.

110
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:02,900
你好呀
Oh, hi!

111
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,570
我只是来送个芝士蛋糕给谢尔顿
I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon.

112
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,960
他被抢劫了  丢了一堆虚拟世界里
He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,530
才用得上的那些虚拟破烂儿
that's useful in a make-believe place.

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,870
我没听懂
I don't know what that means.

115
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,700
很可惜  我听得懂
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,010
你们知道上周末普丽娅带莱纳德
Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard

117
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,410
去海滩玩轮滑吗
rollerblading at the beach?

118
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,180
你们能相信吗
Can you believe that?

119
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,150
我觉得我应该说"那个臭婊子"
I feel like I'm supposed to say "that bitch",

120
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,680
但我又不太了解状况
but I don't have enough information.

121
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,050
我才是那个花了两年时间
I am the one who spent two years

122
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,290
努力说服他
trying to get him to even

123
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,890
去沙滩的那个人
go to the beach in the first place.

124
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,960
而且他超怕踩到医疗垃圾
And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste,

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,860
怕到我得背着他下水
I had to carry him to the water.

126
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,560
我也带霍华德去过一次海滩
I took Howard to the beach once.

127
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,630
他差点像个吸血鬼一样着起火来
He almost burst into flames like a vampire.

128
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,800
我费了那么大劲把莱纳德改造成
So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard

129
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,510
一个超级无敌好男友  可结果我得到了什么
into quality boyfriend material?

130
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,670
我在他女朋友面前还得处处谨小慎微
I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.

131
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,340
你该说那句话了
I think you're on.

132
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,610
那个臭婊子
That bitch!

133
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,350
雪糕上要不要加点咖啡利口酒
Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?

134
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,250
这就是我妈警告过我的那种
Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure

135
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,750
同辈人会教唆我喝酒和嗑药的情景
Mother warned me about.

136
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,590
我还以为永远不会有这么一天呢
I was starting to think it was never going to happen.

137
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,330
我要  谢谢
Yes, please.

138
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,030
你们真应该见识一下我最初认识的莱纳德
You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him.

139
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,030
他都不敢跟人有眼神交流
There was no eye contact.

140
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,430
他不是抬头看天花板
He was either looking up at the ceiling,

141
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,100
就是低头看他的鞋
or down at his shoes.

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,030
我醉了
I'm drunk.

143
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
刚开始的几个月
You know, for the first couple of months,

144
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,640
每次我脱掉胸衣
whenever I would take off my bra,

145
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,480
他都会傻笑着说  天啊  我最胸的朋友
he would giggle and say, "Oh, boy, my breast friends"!

146
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,750
不知道我这么说你会不会好受点
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

147
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,720
但我以后再也不会理普丽娅了
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

148
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,750
不  别这样
No, don't do that.

149
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,320
咱也没理由欺负她呀
No reason to be mean to her.

150
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,720
这也许是醉话
This may be the alcohol talking...

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,990
但我觉得咱还真有理由欺负她
but I believe there is.

152
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,130
你有没有听说过京都大学的西田
Are you familiar with the recent study

153
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,560
和保坂最近做的一项
of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka

154
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,800
关于坦桑尼亚黑猩猩的研究
out of Kyoto University?

155
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,030
没有  但我可以叫出所有卡戴珊姐妹的名字
No, but I can name all the Kardashians.

156
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,940
像咱们这种灵长类动物  天生就会
Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct

157
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,570
排斥族群里不守规矩的成员
to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop.

158
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,910
伯纳黛特想要
Bernadette's urge to

159
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,710
躲避  发怒  或是用排泄物扔普丽娅的冲动
shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya

160
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,950
是与生俱来的
is hard-wired into her DNA.

161
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,850
我没有扔自己排泄物的冲动
I don't have an urge to fling my waste.

162
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,220
相信我  你有的  每个人都有
Believe me, it's there, we all have it.

163
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,350
再给我来点酒我就示范给你看
Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.

164
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,830
好了  我们到了  这就是进行
All right, here we are -- this is the tavern

165
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,460
所有黑市武器交易的小酒馆
where all the black-market weapon trades go down.

166
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,270
我觉得我的角色不应该来这种地方
I don't think my character should be in a place like this.

167
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,470
大家都盯着她开始意淫
Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.

168
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,640
要是你不老是把剑掉到地上
Maybe if you stop dropping your sword

169
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,870
然后再弯腰去捡的话  也许就不会这样了
and bending over to pick it up.

170
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,980
好吧  我们到底要找什么
Okay, what exactly are we looking for?

171
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,010
一个叫"忧郁"的红发巨魔
Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly.

172
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,040
据留言板上的消息说
According to the message boards,

173
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,580
如果你想在深更半夜
if you want to move stolen goods

174
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,720
转移偷来的东西的话  找他就对了
and it's after school hours, he's your guy.

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,240
莱纳德  你还要弄很久吗
Leonard, is this going to take much longer?

176
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,220
你不是说要过二人世界嘛
I thought we were going to spend some time together.

177
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,650
我在陪你呀  而且你也可以
Uh, we are. In the meantime,

178
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,420
建个新人物然后跟我们一块玩呀
you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.

179
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,990
你说笑呢
Seriously?

180
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,590
好吧  你得先输入信用卡号码
Well, you have to put in a credit card number,

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,560
不过真挺好玩的
but it's fun.

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,330
也许我该回家了
Maybe I should just go home.

183
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,830
巨魔来了  我跟上去了
Our troll just walked in! I got him!

184
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,670
我们找到他了  就快搞掂了
We got him. We're almost done.

185
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,970
那么你们打算怎么办
So, how do you guys want to play this?

186
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,510
狠狠教训他  你跟他说
Be ruthless. You tell him

187
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,810
如果他不从实招来的话  我们就
if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint

188
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,740
向他的网络供应商做出正式投诉
with his Internet service provider.

189
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,130
谢尔顿  要是他是从有线电视公司
Sheldon,what if he gets his Internet

190
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,180
连接互联网的怎么办
from his cable company?

191
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,740
他会失去他的HBO有线电视
He could lose his HBO

192
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,120
和所有好看的原创电视节目
and all their delightful original programming.

193
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,490
我不管  我丢东西了  伙计
I don't care! I'm losin' it, man!

194
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,920
我们不如玩得聪明点
Why don't we play this smart?

195
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,230
试试"好妖精 坏妖精"
Try a little "good goblin, bad goblin."

196
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,300
神啊
Oh, dear Lord.

197
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,560
不  我觉得我们得更狡猾些
Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.

198
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,530
好了  我知道你们的意思了
Okay, I see where this is going.

199
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,100
好吧  我会跟他做爱
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

200
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,210
我们不是那个意思
That's not where it was going.

201
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,440
太好了  因为我很讨厌那样
Good, because I would hate that.

202
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,420
莱纳德  你这么忙  我们明天再说吧
Leonard, you're busy-- let's talk tomorrow.

203
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,120
等等  再等一会  你不高兴了吗
Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?

204
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,520
不不  我觉得跟一个男人身男孩心的人约会很性感
No, no, I think it's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

205
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,220
太好了
Good, good.

206
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,260
我会告诉你进展的
I'll tell you what happens.

207
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,130
大家都还觉得我听不出讽刺呢
And people think I don't get sarcasm.

208
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,270
哇  哇  哇
Well, well, well.

209
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,840
看我们碰上谁了
Look who it is.

210
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,910
好的  友好些
Okay, be nice.

211
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,110
你好
Hello.

212
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,040
嗨  我们刚准备出去喝一杯
Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.

213
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,050
因为我现在会喝酒了
Because I do that now.

214
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,080
知足吧
Count your blessings

215
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,250
你不是只坦桑尼亚猩猩
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

216
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,420
什么
What?

217
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,390
别听她的
Don't listen to her--

218
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,290
她冰激凌吃多了
she's had a lot of ice cream.

219
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,220
你想一起来吗
Do you want to join us?

220
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,890
谢谢  但是我得工作
Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,460
四个女人走下楼
Four women walk down the stairs--

222
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,070
几个人能到大厅
how many reach the lobby?

223
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,950
你昨晚回家时  你妹妹说什么了吗
Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?

224
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,890
不要  别把我扯进来
Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this.

225
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,550
我可不当你的中间人
I'm not going to be your go-between.

226
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,720
拜托  帮帮我
Come on, help me out.

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,120
我有麻烦吗
Am I in trouble?

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,090
不需要担心
There's no reason to worry.

229
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,230
我放心多了
That's a relief.

230
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,530
我肯定很多在幸福关系中的女人
I'm sure many women

231
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,760
会跟她们的前男友"山鸡"
in happy relationships spend their nights

232
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,160
视频聊天来度过漫漫长夜
Skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

233
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,040
好消息  同志们  我找到那个黑客了
Good news, gentlemen-- I found our hacker.

234
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,370
什么  真的
What? Really?

235
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,240
对  没人能逃得出我的手掌心
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

236
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,940
瓦尔多不行  卡门圣迭戈不行
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

237
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,140
娜塔莉·波特曼的裸照也不行
not even topless Natalie Portman.

238
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,980
我以前从没说过这话
I've never said these words before,

239
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,380
干得不错  霍华德
but good job, Howard!

240
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,920
谢谢  我们的罪犯是托德·札内基
Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki,

241
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,090
加利福尼亚州
2711 Ocean View Road,

242
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,660
卡尔斯拜德  海景路2711号
Carlsbad, California.

243
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,660
这名字和地址都渗着邪恶的气息
The name and the address drip with evil.

244
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,000
我们还知道什么
What else do we know about him?

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,830
还有很多  其实
Why, quite a bit, actually.

246
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,030
我打赌他是一个跟父母一起住的失败者
I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents.

247
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,210
对  他确实跟父母一起住
Yes, he does live with his parents.

248
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,510
这是他们家的谷歌地图照片
Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.

249
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,480
太好了  在死胡同里
Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac.

250
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,650
我们可以把他包饺子
We can box him in.

251
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,580
等等  你要去那儿吗
Hold on, you're thinking of going there?

252
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,890
卡尔斯拜德离这只有几小时车程
Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.

253
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,020
好吧
Fine.

254
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,960
你走到门口  敲门
You walk up to the house, knock on the door

255
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
然后要你的东西  他要是拒绝怎么办
and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?

256
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,190
我不知道你最近看没看新闻  莱纳德
I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard,

257
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,030
最近在拷问领域有很多
but there have been some terrific advancements

258
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,600
很棒的进展
in the field of torture.

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,070
没人要被拷问
No one's getting tortured.

260
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,300
好吧  我们会遵守日内瓦公约
Fine, we'll abide by the Geneva Convention.

261
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
但是  问问你自己
But ask yourself this:

262
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,770
我们的一生中
in the course of our lives,

263
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,110
多少午饭钱被人抢走了
how much lunch money has been taken from us?

264
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,880
多少风筝
How many kites?

265
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,610
多少史酷比活页夹
How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?

266
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,750
我真的有那么一个夹子
I totally had one of those.

267
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,150
当然了
Of course you did.

268
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,690
那是整理学校作业最有趣又实用的工具
It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work.

269
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,060
但是那些恶霸从我们手里抢走了它
But the bullies took it from us.

270
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,020
再也不会了
Well, no more.

271
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,190
今晚  我们要重拾尊严
Tonight, we take back our dignity,

272
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,290
我们与生俱来的权利和自尊
our birthright and our pride.

273
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,460
怎么样
What do you say?

274
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,960
谁跟我一起
Who's with me?

275
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,840
5点我有节hip-hop健身操课  我们能结束后走吗
I have a hip-hop aerobics class at 5:00; could we go after?

276
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,310
当然
Sure.

277
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,370
还有  今晚是安息日
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

278
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,940
我妈和我的传统是
and my mother and I have a tradition of

279
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,150
点亮蜡烛  一起看《幸运之轮》
lighting the candles and watching Wheel of Fortune, so...

280
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,180
如果我们我们8点出发
If we could leave at 8:00,

281
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,480
我们还能在10点
we'd still be able to

282
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,080
最晚10:30重获我们的权利
regain our birthright at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

283
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,180
行
Fine.

284
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,490
莱纳德
Leonard?

285
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,190
完了  我不知道能不能连续两晚
Oh, geez, I-I don't know if I can ditch Priya

286
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,490
都放普丽娅鸽子
two nights in a row.

287
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,660
拜托  伙计
Oh, come on, man.

288
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,330
男人如手足  女人如衣服
Bros before...

289
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,230
我妹亦然
...my sister.

290
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,470
不管了
Aw, screw it.

291
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,570
-我去  -我也去
- I'm in. - Me, too.

292
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,440
还有我
And me.

293
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,470
稍等
One moment.

294
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,210
为了抓住网络罪犯  我会不顾一切
I'm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal,

295
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,450
至于流行性病毒感冒  还是算了吧
not the common cold.

296
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,620
抱歉  我以为有事耽搁是因为
I'm sorry, I thought this delay was

297
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,920
你要和你妈妈一起看《幸运之轮》
so you could watch <i>Wheel of</i> <i>Fortune</i> with your mother.

298
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,190
确实如此
I am.

299
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,790
她正在漂胡子呢
She's just bleaching her mustache.

300
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,000
不信你听
Check it out.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,160
妈  "给两头猜中间"游戏时间
Hey, Ma! "Before and After!"

302
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,600
4个词  17个字母  有两个N  一个V
Four words, 17 letters, two N's, one V!

303
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,040
"狼的腰包"
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

304
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,510
太厉害了
That's incredible.

305
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,180
对啊  她差不多算是这个节目的专家
Yeah, she's kind of a <i>Wheel</i> savant.

306
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,410
啊哦  普丽娅打来了
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

307
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,080
你用西塔琴作为她的铃声可不好哦  兄弟
Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.
西塔琴是北印度最重要发弦乐器

308
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,750
小点声
Hit the...

309
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,620
宝贝
Hey, sweetie.

310
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,890
真的很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry.

311
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,790
我今天要工作到很晚
I'm gonna be working late.

312
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
对  我也想你
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

313
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
没问题  等我到家了我会打给你的
Okay, sure, I'll call you when I get home.

314
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,600
好的  拜
Okay, bye-bye.

315
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,870
干得好
Very nice.

316
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,670
你欺骗了我的妹妹
You lie to my sister.

317
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,270
那算他对你妹妹做过的最好的事情了
That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.

318
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,120
猜猜是谁
Oh, guess who.

319
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,650
掩护我
Cover for me.

320
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,990
普丽娅  怎么了
Hello, Priya. What's up?

321
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,360
我怎么会知道莱纳德是不是在工作
How would I know if Leonard's at work or not?

322
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,890
你疑心病不要太重啦
Don't be suspicious.

323
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,660
听着  如果你想继续你和莱纳德的恋情
Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard

324
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,330
无论是让你怒目而视的
to continue, you're going to have to believe

325
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,130
或是荒谬可笑的借口
whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse

326
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,330
你都得信任这白恶魔所说的
the white devil has the nerve to offer you.

327
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,070
懂了吗  好的  再见
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

328
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,910
你欠我个人情
You owe me.

329
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,680
新猜谜  妈
New puzzle, Ma!

330
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,950
"同姓不同名"
"Same name"!

331
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,650
一个N  两个D  三个0
One N, two D's, three O's!

332
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,350
乌比·戈德堡和鲁布·戈德堡
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
前者为美国著名黑人女星  后者为美国漫画家

333
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,680
真是太不可思议了
That's uncanny.

334
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,520
我知道  这就是她的超能力
I know. It's her superpower.

335
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,590
错  还包括她会颤抖的臂脂肪区
Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.

336
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,090
真不敢相信我们为了与那个家伙当面对峙
I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego

337
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,900
居然一路杀到圣地亚哥
to confront this guy.

338
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,500
就是  我们就像坏蛋  对不
Yeah, we're kind of bad-asses, aren't we?

339
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,870
十足的坏
Totally.

340
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,330
我们在这过夜
Hey, how about we stay the night

341
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,800
然后一早去乐高积木乐园  怎么样
and hit Legoland in the morning?

342
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,410
海洋世界更好玩
Sea World is better.

343
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,440
那里有虎鲸明星莎木  绝对给你带来重量级的乐趣
It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun.

344
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,750
不过目前  咱们还是把注意力集中在托德·札内基身上
But for the moment, let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.

345
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,380
就是  托德·札内基  我们来抓你啦
Yeah, we're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki.

346
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,890
我郑重声明一下  乐高积木乐园有更多互动
And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.

347
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,250
我几乎为那个傻坐在错层的
I almost feel sorry for the poor fool,

348
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,960
郊区农场的可怜虫感到抱歉
sitting in his split-level suburban ranch,

349
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,190
完全没意识到有一群复仇的人们
unaware that a vengeful horde

350
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,000
正以每小时71迈的速度
is barreling down the San Diego Freeway

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,230
飞驰在圣地亚哥的高速上
at 71 miles an hour.

352
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,700
开慢点  快车手
Ease up there, lead foot.

353
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,170
你想车毁人亡呀
You trying to get us killed?

354
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,410
恕我冒昧  我们先用这张
I took the liberty of burning us

355
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,510
英雄出征任务的混音CD热热身吧
a mix of heroic questing music.

356
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,780
上面写的是"碧昂斯秀色可餐舞蹈混音专辑"
This says "Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix."

357
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,480
这是张可重写CD
It's a re-writable CD.

358
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,380
别废话  快放进去
Just put it in.

359
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,120
碧昂斯  坑爹呢
Beyonce? Really?

360
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,950
她曲线动人  而且她身材是好
She's curvy and she owns it.

361
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,490
我喜欢这点
I like that.

362
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,690
瓦格纳经典交响曲  《女武神的骑行》

363
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,900
没错  我感受到那份激情了
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

364
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,730
我们的愤怒张开双翅
We are winged fury!

365
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
即便这样  还是没有任何理由
Which is still no excuse

366
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,040
超过高速公布的速度限制标准
for going over the posted speed limit.

367
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,550
下次我们去教训某人的时候
Next time we go to kick someone's ass,

368
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,150
坐火车去得了
we take the train.

369
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,080
火车总是我的第一选择
I always prefer the train.

370
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,260
谢尔顿  走吧
Sheldon, let's go.

371
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,530
来了
Coming.

372
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,370
你为什么要带上这个
Why did you bring that?

373
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,400
没有什么武器能比克林贡的荣誉剑
No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart

374
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,410
更能把恐惧扎进一个人的心
than a Klingon bat'leth.

375
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,580
好吧  我们先把话说清楚
Okay, let's get clear on something.

376
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,650
我们来这是为了告诉那个家伙把你的东西
We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of

377
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,480
全部转回你的账户上  然后我们就回家
your stuff back into your account and then be on our way.

378
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,980
没人要用荣誉剑扎任何人
No one's bat'lething anybody.

379
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,850
所以我锋利的刀刃今晚是尝不到鲜血咯
So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?

380
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,390
对
No.

381
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,030
好吧  现在我觉得举着这东西很傻逼
Well, now I just feel silly holding it.

382
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,700
来吧
Come on.

383
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
那我至少能一脚踹开他家门吧
Can I at least kick down the door?

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,970
随便踹  但某天
You're welcome to try, but the other day,

385
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,700
你打开个联邦快递的盒子都花了十五分钟
it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.

386
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,140
谁呀
Who is it?

387
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,940
你的末日
Your doom!

388
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,240
别说"你的末日"
Don't say "your doom."

389
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,650
谁会给自己的末日开门
Who opens the door for their doom?

390
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,020
说得有道理
Good point.

391
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
一篮小狗狗
Basket of puppies.

392
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,750
有事吗
What?

393
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,420
呃
Uh...

394
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,290
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

395
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,460
你是托德·札内基吗
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

396
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,130
是  你是谁
Yeah. Who are you?

397
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,300
我是艾泽拉斯的谢耳朵
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

398
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,940
我要你把我的东西还回来
I want my things back.

399
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,070
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

400
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,270
给我看看
Let me see that.

401
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,570
小心点  那可是珍藏品
Careful. That's a collectible.

402
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,670
我知道
I know.

403
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,740
我一直很想要一个
I've always wanted one.

404
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,450
他比我们想象的还要狡猾
Well, he's even more cunning than we thought.

405
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,870
知道吗  闹笑话的是他
You know, the joke's on him.

406
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,200
没有真品凭证
Without the certificate of authenticity,

407
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,840
那把荣誉剑分文不值
that bat'leth is worthless.

408
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,510
对  他正中下怀  进了咱们的圈套
Yeah, he walked right into our trap.

409
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,480
乐高积木公园如今成了遥不可及的梦了

对了  莱纳德
So, Leonard,

423
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,920
你没有让你女朋友来接你
I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend

424
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,120
这事有点儿意思
to come get you.

425
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,590
我告诉她我在工作
Uh, I kind of told her I was working.

426
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,430
所以你对她撒谎了
So you lied to her.

427

真有意思
Also interesting.

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,870
对  她不是很懂

她不懂没关系  只要她漂亮就好了嘛
Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.

431
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,440
这事儿才有意思呢  莱纳德
This one's funny, Leonard.

432
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,880
你怎么会跟这么懂事的女孩分手呢
How come you couldn't make it work with her?

433
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,650
那你们至少把谢尔顿那些假玩意儿要回来了吧
So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?

434

没有  我们伟大的寻物征途失败了
No. We failed in our noble quest.

435
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,020
怎么回事
How come?

436
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,560
托德·札内基是个贱人

经典交响曲《女武神的骑行》

442
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,080

This ain't no Beyonce.

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,670

我都说了是"我们"
I said, "we."

453
