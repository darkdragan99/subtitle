1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,490
我对僵尸有一点困惑
Here's what I wonder about zombies.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,110
要是他们找不到人肉吃会怎么样
What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat?

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,740
他们不可能饿死  他们本来就是死人嘛
They can't starve to death-- they're already dead.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,780
你听听我的  我昨晚花了一个小时在想
You take this one. I spent an hour last night on

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,230
"既然吸血鬼在镜子里
"How do vampires shave

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,520
都看不见自己  他们是怎么给自己剃胡子的"
when they can't see themselves in the mirror"?

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,610
衣冠楚楚的吸血鬼两两搭伴
Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,850
互相刮胡子  解释完毕
and shave each other-- case closed.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,310
好吧  那  僵尸呢
Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,390
我觉得这取决于僵尸的种类  拉杰
I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,510
我们现在说的是快僵尸还是慢僵尸
Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies?

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,570
在《28天》里面  如果那些僵尸不吃东西
Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat,

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,640
-他们就会饿死  -你说的是
- they starved.  - You're thinking

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,850
《惊变28天》
of 28 Days Later.

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,170
《28天》里面桑德拉·布洛克去戒酒
28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,730
结果让观众升华到濒死状态
and puts the audience into an undead state.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,630
喂  不许你说桑德拉·布洛克坏话
Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock!

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,760
你以为这样显得很有内涵
You think it makes you look cultured,

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,520
但你表现出来的只是刻薄而已
but you just come off as bitter.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,350
12点方向  希伯特博士
Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,450
为啥大学校长
Why's the president of the university

22
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,660
要来食堂里视察呢
slumming in the cafeteria?

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,360
也许他在模仿莎翁笔下的亨利五世
Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V,

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,530
微服私访  想知道在民间
who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them,

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,650
他的臣民们是如何看待自己的
to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects.

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,740
当然  如果他看过我发给他的1300封
Of course, if he'd have read any of the 1,300 e-mails

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,750
关于学校管理的邮件中的任何一封
I've sent him on the subject of his administration,

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,610
他就不必这么费劲了
he could have saved himself the trouble.

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,590
也可能是因为他听说今天周二有炸薯棒
Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,850
反正我是因为这个才来的
That's why I'm here.

31
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,260
嗨  我最器重的天才们
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses!

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,030
今天过得怎么样啊
How are we doing today?

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,690
这取决于  你打算
That depends-- how much longer

34
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,750
在我的肩膀上抚摸多久
do you plan on fondling my shoulder?

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,140
抱歉  库珀博士  我忘了你有爱抚恐惧症
Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,040
我不是怕人抚摸  我是怕细菌
It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,230
要是你愿意戴一双乳胶手套
If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,

38
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,980
给我查疝气都没问题
I'll let you check me for a hernia.

39
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,350
好吧
Yeah.

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,020
听好了各位
So, listen, fellas,

41
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,010
本周六晚上谁想去参加一个小宴会呢
who's up for a little party this Saturday night?

42
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,210
美酒  佳肴  没准儿还会有几位甜妞
Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,210
听起来很赞啊  我去
Sounds great! I'm in!

44
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,460
慢着
Hold on.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,690
就因为一位怪蜀黍给你们糖吃
Just because the nice man is offering you candy,

46
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,360
并不意味着你就应该跳进人贩子的破车里
doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van.

47
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,970
究竟是什么场合啊
What's the occasion?

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,070
就是本校的几位赞助者
Just a little fund-raiser for the university.

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,980
啊哈  沾满泪痕的气垫还在车后面呢
Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,600
你不情愿我很理解  库珀博士
I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,480
我深表同情  但残酷的事实摆在面前
and I sympathize, but the hard facts are,

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,630
有时候我们不得不为了募集研究资金
occasionally, we have to shake a few hands

53
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,890
而跟某些人溜须拍马
and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.

54
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,760
我不管  这太下作了
I don't care; it's demeaning.

55
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,140
我不愿想像只德州博览会的冠军猪一样
And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,590
被人领着到处表演
like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair.

57
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,830
顺便提一下  这种博览会肯定不是你想穿着
Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend

58
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,210
别有星际迷航徽章的衣服参加的
wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform.

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,640
好吧
All right,

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,070
那我换个说法
let me put it this way.

61
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,240
你们都得给我穿好正装参加这个宴会
You're gonna put on a suit, you're gonna come to this party,

62
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,590
你们要向一群老人解释
and you're gonna explain your research

63
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,910
你们所做的研究
to a bunch of old people,

64
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,740
否则  我对天发誓  我会用热勺子烫瞎你的眼睛
or I swear to God, I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

65
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,370
就像《贫民窟的百万富翁》里的那个小男孩一样
like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.

66
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,510
你肯定不想那样的
Oh, you don't want that.

67
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,190
那就周六晚上咯
So, Saturday night!

68
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,650
包你开心
It's gonna be off the hook.

69
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,800
速度拿开
Get over it.

70
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,410
哦天啊
Oh, boy!

71
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,370
又是炸薯棒又是宴会邀请
Tator tots and a party invitation?

72
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,040
今天是个好日子啊
What a great day!

73
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,860

生活大爆炸第四季第十五集

78
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,120
好了
There you go.

79
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,420
你确定这样就行了
Are you sure this is right?

80
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,280
嗯  把这一段塞到裤子里  就没事了
Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants; you'll be fine.

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,490
一起去给拍那些有钱人的马屁吧
Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tochis.

82
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,140
霍华德  我真不敢相信伯纳黛特居然让你
Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go

83
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,600
穿着女式衬领去参加这么正式的宴会
to a fancy party wearing a dickey.

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,690
不好意思  我的衣服不是我女朋友挑的
Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes.

85
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,090
是我妈挑的
My mother does.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
我们该出发了
Oh. We should get going.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
那谢尔顿呢
What about Sheldon?

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,420
谢尔顿不去
Sheldon is not going.

89
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,770
真的假的  那我们怎么跟希伯特交待
Really? What do we tell Siebert?

90
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,980
告诉他库珀博士觉得他宝贵时间最有价值的用途
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time

91
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,210
就是运用他那举世罕见的天赋
is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties

92
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,870
来揭开自然的面纱  目睹上帝的真面
to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.

93
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,860
谢尔顿  现在是周六晚上  你要去洗衣服了
Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.

94
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,360
别跟他说这个  说揭开面纱啥的
Don't tell him that, tell him the mask thing.

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,740
喂  把领带塞回裤子里
Hey, put your tie back in your pants.

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,440
这地儿不错啊
Nice place.

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,270
让我想起了我爸妈在新德里的房子
Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.

98
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,310
-别逗了  -真的  我家很有钱的
- You're kidding.  - No. We are very wealthy.

99
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,010
但跟这里唯一的区别就是  我们的仆人更多
But the only difference is, we have more servants.

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
-比这儿还多啊  -多得没地儿使唤
- More than this?  - More than we can use.

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,980
你看吧  在印度  我们都不会犯
You see, in India, we don't make the mistake

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,350
让人们有梦想这种错误
of letting our poor people have dreams.

103
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,520
我的牛人小队来了
Ah. There's my band of brainiacs.

104
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,240
库珀博士在哪儿呢
Where's Dr. Cooper?

105
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,020
他正在揭开自然的面纱  目睹上帝的真面
He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.

106
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,300
校领导认定他有颗美丽心灵
The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind.

107
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,500
我认为他就是浮云
I think he's just bananas.

108
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,540
来吧  我来介绍你们认识一位
Come on, let me introduce you

109
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,080
咱们学校的主要捐款人
to one of the university's leading donors.

110
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,060
我觉得咱们被他们所谓的美女误导了
I think we were misled about the cute girls.

111
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,360
莱森女士  这是我们学校
Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,320
三位了不起的青年学者
of our outstanding young researchers.

113
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,110
这位是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

114
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,420
拉杰·库萨帕里博士和霍华德·沃罗威茨
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.

115
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,770
沃罗威茨你怎么了
Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz,

116
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,740
坚持不下去读博么
couldn't stick with it long enough to get your PhD?

117
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,910
我是工程师
I'm an engineer.

118
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,100
工程师通常不需要博士学位
Most engineers don't bother with a PhD.

119
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,170
不过你没准想知道
But you may be interested to know

120
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,760
我给NASA设计过零重力废物排放系统的
I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.

121
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,280
懂了  你就是太空水管工
Got it-- you're a space plumber.

122
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,530
我去吧台喝两杯
I'm gonna go hit the bar.

123
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,210
介绍这两位吧
Tell me about these two.

124
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,150
先介绍他
Do him first.

125
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,550
霍夫斯塔德博士今天晚上会做个我们实验物理项目的演讲
Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight.

126
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,150
我想你会对他迷人的工作感兴趣的
I think you'll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.

127
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,540
行吧
Right.

128
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,100
迷我一下
Fascinate me.

129
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,520
他们快要尿裤子的样子很可爱吧
They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they?

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,450
这么说吧
I'll make it easy for you.

131
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,090
每天早上你到实验室的第一件事
When you arrive at the lab in the morning,

132
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,310
你会最先打开什么机器
what sort of machine do you turn on?

133
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,940
咖啡机
Coffee maker?

134
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,780
行吧 库那什么博士  到你了
All right, Dr. Kooth-- uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

135
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,820
我叫库萨帕里
It's Koothrappali.

136
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,860
我得去嘘嘘了
I have to tinkle.

137
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,150
于是  我没有屈服于权贵
And so, instead of bowing to pressure,

138
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,870
去参加那个毫无意义的社交晚会
and going to that pointless soiree,

139
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,180
而是待在家里  把衣服都洗了
I stayed right here and did a load of whites.

140
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,330
通常我会赞许你那反社会的大男子气概
Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude

141
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,130
不听你们领导的
toward "The Man,"

142
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,060
但这回  我觉得你犯了个愚蠢的错误
but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.

143
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,650
不可能
Unlikely.

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,180
但请你说完
But make your case.

145
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,450
请记住  您那批评的语气
Keeping in mind that your critical attitude

146
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,550
正毁坏咱们周六夜晚的美好时光
is ruining our Saturday night together,

147
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,200
我都没有把你窗口最小化
and I'm not above minimizing your window.

148
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,170
谢尔顿  不管你喜不喜欢
Sheldon, like it or not,

149
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,140
在你能把你的智慧
until you manage to upload your intelligence

150
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,010
上载到一颗自给自足  装备着高速互联网
into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite,

151
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,350
和隐形设备的轨道卫星上之前
equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device,

152
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,470
你还是需要依靠其他人类同胞的
you will be dependent on other members of the human race.

153
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,110
够了  我要把你最小化了
That's it. Prepare to be minimized.

154
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,500
我还没说完
I'm not finished.

155
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,860
谢尔顿  所有科学家都要去募集资金
All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon.

156
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,640
你觉得我的实验室靠的是什么资金
How do you think I paid for my lab?

157
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,540
我去了沙特阿拉伯  遇到个王子
I went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince

158
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,810
他正好对神经生物学感兴趣
who had an interest in neurobiology.

159
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,560
你的实验室靠中东业余爱好者资助的么
Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?

160
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,050
更准确地说  法伊萨是我未婚夫
Technically, Faisal is my fianc?

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
但我现在有最高端的双光子显微镜
But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope

162
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,810
冬天去利雅得(阿拉伯半岛中部的城市)还有个住所
and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.

163
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,000
终于明白你Facebook上面那些诡异的骆驼比赛的照片
Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,010
是哪里来的了
on your Facebook page.

165
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,010
你这么想
And consider this:

166
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,460
如果物理学院没有你出面
without you to make the case for the physics department,

167
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,450
募捐的重任就落到莱纳德和拉杰那种人头上了
the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.

168
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,510
你唬我么
Are you trying to scare me?

169
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,210
你成功了
'Cause you're succeeding.

170
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,560
等着更恐怖的吧
Well, then prepare to be terrified.

171
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,160
如果你的朋友们没有足够说服力的话
If your friends are unconvincing,

172
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,880
今年的捐款可能就被
this year's donations might go to,

173
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,650
地质学院卷走了
say, the geology department.

174
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,470
不要吧  那些烂泥研究员
Oh, dear, not the dirt people!

175
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,180
或者更糟糕
Or worse-- it could go to...

176
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,250
也可能给人文学院哦
the liberal arts.

177
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,660
不要
No!

178
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,800
几百万的捐款都在那些骚人墨客
Millions of dollars being showered on poets,

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,380
身上打了水漂
literary theorists and students of gender studies.

180
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,280
噢  人文啊
Oh, the humanities!

181
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
往好处想  我觉得希伯特校长再也不会
On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert

182
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,330
让我们参加任何募捐活动了
will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.

183
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,270
受戒仪式都没这么痛苦
It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah.

184
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,500
那些老家伙也就捏捏你的小脸蛋
The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek

185
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,340
就把储蓄债券给了你
and handed you a savings bond.

186
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,470
别这么闷闷不乐嘛
Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

187
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,810
看这的虾有多大
Look at the size of these shrimp!

188
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,630
到多大就可以叫做龙虾了
At what point do we start calling them lobsters?

189
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,090
承认吧  我们搞砸了
Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.

190
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,740
没那么糟糕啦
Oh, you didn't do that badly.

191
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,800
莱瑟姆女士  我每天早晨第一个打开的机器
Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning

192
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,420
是氦氖激光器  给它预热
is the helium-neon laser, 'cause it needs to warm up.

193
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,560
亲爱的我不关心
I no longer care, dear.

194
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,100
别着急
But don't worry,

195
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,530
今天晚上见到你们很高兴
I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.

196
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,430
别开玩笑了  哪里值得高兴了
You're kidding. That was good for you?

197
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,800
我出了一身汗了
'Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.

198
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,300
最好不过了
Excellent! There's nothing I like better

199
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,330
我最喜欢调戏聪明人了
than making smart people feel ill at ease.

200
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,880
啥
Why?

201
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,340
你有了钱之后
Oh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things

202
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,860
就喜欢找这种乐子
you get to do when you have lots of money.

203
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,150
看着
Watch.

204
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,280
谁让你吃这里的虾了
Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp?

205
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,850
有趣吧
See? Fun.

206
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,400
不不不  我只是来要钱的
No, no, no, I'm just here for your money.

207
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,480
我不想握任何人的带菌手
I don't want to shake anyone's germy hands.

208
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,700
希伯特  快跟他们说清楚
Explain it to them, Siebert.

209
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,840
我必须承认
I must confess

210
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,200
我不懂你什么意思  希伯特校长
I don't understand you, President Siebert.

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,960
你一开始说你想要我出席你的筹款会
First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers,

212
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,380
现在你又说你再也不想让我
but now you say you never want me to go

213
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,600
接近你的筹款会
anywhere near your fund-raisers.

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,660
不好意思  但您这意思有点混乱呀
Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message.

215
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,300
又来了
Here we go again.

216
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,160
如果你懒得跟我讲话的话
If there's simply no talking to me,

217
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,130
那干吗还打电话给我
why did you call?

218
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
对不起  另一条线上有电话进来了
I'm sorry, someone's on the other line.

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,730
你何不组织一下你的语言
Why don't you see if you can organize your thoughts,

220
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,630
我们晚点再聊
and we'll try again later.

221
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,580
库珀和霍夫斯塔德家  简称库珀家
Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.

222
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,890
早上好  莱森太太
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

223
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,450
当然  我当然记得你
Well, yes, of course I remember you.

224
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,180
一个通过把死去丈夫得来的
A woman well past her prime

225
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,160
不义之财都捐赠出去以提高自己的
seeking to augment her social status

226
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,500
社会地位的女人
by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains.

227
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,920
那你准备给我多少钱
So, how much money are you going to give me?

228
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,420
我不疯  我妈带我检查过的
I'm not crazy -- my mother had me tested.

229
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,660
如果你不准备给我钱
Well, if you're not going to give me money,

230
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,400
那你打电话来干嘛
then why are you calling?

231
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,300
她要跟你讲话
She wants to talk to you.

232
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,050
到底谁才是疯子
Who's crazy now?

233
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,960
你好  莱森太太
Hello, Mrs. Latham.

234
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,580
是的  我跟他住在一起
Yes, I live with him.

235
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,320
我不  我也不知道为什么
I don't...I-I really don't know why.

236
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,970
今晚吗  好的  没问题
Tonight? Sure, that'd be great.

237
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,160
好的  到时见
Okay, I'll see you then.

238
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,390
再见
Bye.

239
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,270
她想跟我共进晚餐  谈谈我的研究
She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.

240
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,340
就你那点研究还用得着整个晚餐的时间来讨论吗
An entire dinner to talk about your research?

241
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,360
你们去哪吃  免下车的魔术盒快餐[美国快餐店]吗
Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?

242
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,170
不管去哪都好
Well, wherever we're going,

243
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,610
她会派车来接我
she's sending a car to pick me up.

244
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,520
好吧
Okay,

245
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
-我明白了  -明白什么了
- I see what's happening.  - What?

246
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,700
我的境界吓到她了
My stature intimidates her,

247
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,670
所以她就利用你来接近我
so she's using you to get to me.

248
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,170
狡猾的老师太
Crafty old gal.

249
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,290
不好意思  但你并不是这间公寓里唯一
Excuse me, but you are not the only

250
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,560
一名出色的科学家
distinguished scientist in this apartment.

251
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,390
我在同行评审刊物里发表过论文
I've been published in peer-reviewed journals,

252
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,150
我在实验粒子物理学方面获得过
I received a Dissertation of the Year award

253
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,520
年度专题论文奖
for experimental particle physics.

254
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,510
不  不可能
No, that can't be it.

255
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,210
还有你似乎忘了
And since you seem

256
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,380
咱俩住在一起
to have forgotten, the reason we live together

257
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,050
是因为咱俩是死党
is we're best friends.

258
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,150
我会挺你的  杰克
And I got your back, Jack.

259
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,730
-晚餐棒极了  -很高兴你喜欢
- That was a great meal.  - I'm glad you enjoyed it.

260
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,640
我唯一一次吃得这么好  就是我妈来看我
The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town

261
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,610
-然后带我出去吃饭那次  -是吗
- and she takes me out to dinner.  - Is that so?

262
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,650
你跟她有点像
You kind of remind me of her.

263
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,700
她也喜欢把人弄得不自在
She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.

264
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,100
你让我想起我在大学时期的男朋友
Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.

265
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,940
-不会吧  -很可爱的男孩
- No kidding.  - Sweet boy.

266
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,420
非常聪明
Very smart.

267
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,590
要是他有钱就好了
If only he'd had money.

268
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,490
说到钱
So, hey, speaking of money,

269
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,910
你想不想帮物理系添置一个
how are you feeling about helping the physics department

270
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,250
低温离心泵和一个分子筛
get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?

271
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,740
我只能说  你很有说服力
Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.

272
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,120
-太好了  太好了  -而我真的
- Oh, good, good.  - And I'm seriously

273
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
在考虑要进一步发展
considering taking it to the next level.

274
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,670
太棒了  这太好了
Terrific. Great.

275
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,770
怎么个进一步发展法
What level is that?

276
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,950
现在你不像我妈了
Okay, now you don't remind me of my mom.

277
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,810
对不起  也就是说  最终僵尸会
I'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack

278
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,850
袭击桑德拉·布洛克[美国女演员]所在的戒酒中心吗
the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?

279
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,510
没错  谢尔顿  继续看吧
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

280
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,140
这太可惜了
You know, it's a shame,

281
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,030
她那么费劲地要戒酒
all that work she's doing to get sober,

282
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,460
结果就为了被生吞活剥
only to be torn apart and eaten alive.

283
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,380
晚餐怎么样
Hey. How was dinner?

284
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,110
一级棒  我得喝上一杯
Swell. I need a drink.

285
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,940
我们还有酒吗
Do we have any alcohol?

286
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,320
没有  但是我们有土豆  我可以给你做伏特加
No. But we have potatoes -- I could make you vodka.

287
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,790
不过要两周才能做好
It'll take two weeks.

288
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,010
莱纳德  你没事吧
Leonard, are you okay?

289
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,570
我不确定
Um, I'm not sure.

290
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,570
怎么了
What's going on?

291
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,890
莱森说她在考虑要给我们捐钱
Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering

292
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,290
好让我们买一个
donating money so we could get

293
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,220
低温离心泵
a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

294
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,210
太棒了
Yes!

295
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,740
然后她就把舌头伸进我嘴里了
...then she stuck her tongue down my throat.

296
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,060
为什么
Why?

297
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,170
我们不能总是每件事都解释给你听
Okay, we can't keep explaining everything.

298
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,120
自己去看看我们买给你的那本书
Read that book we got you.

299
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,060
她喜欢我
She hit on me.

300
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,350
等一下  等一下  等一下  你是说
Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us

301
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,870
那个老师太想要跟你上床
that old lady wanted to have sex with you

302
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,500
作为给你的院系捐赠上百万美金的条件吗
in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?

303
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,580
好像是
I think so.

304
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,470
你个幸运的小鸭子
You lucky duck.

305
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,760
你还真是够扭曲的啊
You're really a broken toy, aren't you?

306
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,440
我赶在她有下一步行动之前
I was able to get out of there

307
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,720
就逃回来了
before anything else happened,

308
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
可她明晚还想见我
but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.

309
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,440
太棒了  你准备穿什么
Excellent! What are you planning to wear?

310
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,080
什么
What?

311
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,150
佩妮  你在用肉体
Penny, you're an expert

312
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,480
来交换物质这反面是专家
on trading sexual favors for material gain --

313
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,190
教教他
walk him through this.

314
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,000
不不  等一下
Well, n-no, hold on a second,

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,510
我才不要跟她上床呢
I'm not going to sleep with her.

316
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,620
但是我们需要低温离心泵
But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

317
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,150
想也别想  我才不会这么做呢
Well, forget it! It's not gonna happen.

318
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,170
拜托  莱纳德  这可能是你
Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance

319
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,040
为科学做贡献的唯一机会了
to make a real contribution to science!

320
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,480
我重申一遍  不可能
I repeat, not gonna happen.

321
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,010
你刚才说我出卖肉体来交换物质
What was all that about me trading sexual favors

322
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,730
是什么意思
for material gain?

323
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,450
这是赞美
It was a compliment.

324
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,290
我觉得值得赞美的时候就该赞美
I believe in giving credit where credit is due.

325
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,790
好的  我会转告他
Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

326
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,160
莱纳德  莱森太太的车在楼下等你
Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car is here for you.

327
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,350
我一会儿就回来  我就下去为经费
I won't be too late; I'm just gonna make

328
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,590
做最后一次努力  再跟她道声晚安
a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.

329
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,490
等等  我有东西要给你
Hold on, I have something for you.

330
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,440
这是什么
What's this?

331
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,020
你今晚可能会用到的东西
Just a few things you may need tonight.

332
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,240
BB油  保险套  还有
Baby oil, condoms and, uh...

333
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,090
我在医药学院搞来的小药丸
a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology.

334
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,130
他们说这是伟哥中的战斗哥
They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.

335
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,550
我不会跟她上床的
I am not going to have sex with her.

336
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,650
或许这个能帮助你克服你的不情愿
Maybe this will overcome your reluctance.

337
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,270
为了激发你的性欲  我上网找了
I went on the Internet and found a photograph

338
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,560
一张莱森太太25岁时的照片
of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming.

339
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,100
看她穿着马鞍鞋呢  嗷~
Check out those saddle shoes.

340
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,730
你脑子进水啦
Are you insane?

341
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,450
我才不会为了几台新设备
I'm not going to prostitute myself

342
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,290
就出卖自己的肉体呢
just so we can get some new equipment.

343
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,260
拜托  何乐而不为呢
Oh, come on! Why not?

344
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,720
晚安  谢尔顿
Good night, sheldon.

345
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,250
鉴于你用于毫无意义的自慰所花费的大量时间
Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse,

346
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,070
不妨考虑一下  就这一次
you might consider, just this once,

347
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,720
让自己的生殖器达到真正合体的高潮
using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!

348
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,330
他还是不愿意献身给那个老女人  对吧
He still won't shag the old lady, huh?

349
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,850
对  多谢关心
No. But thank you for asking.

350
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,920
你好
Hey. Hi.

351
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,310
你好  莱纳德
Hello, Leonard.

352
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,880
希望你饿了
I hope you're hungry.

353
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,540
我饿得不行不行的
I'm very hungry.

354
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,430
仅限于对食物  是吧
For food, right?

355
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,020
昨晚我让你不安了吧
Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night.

356
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,180
真是抱歉
I'm so sorry.

357
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,530
没关系
No, that's okay.

358
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,710
不  你肯定在说违心话
No, it most certainly is not.

359
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,900
莱纳德  不管咱们之间发生了什么
Leonard, I'm making the donation to your department

360
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,620
我都会给你的实验室捐款
regardless of what happens between us.

361
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,250
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Well, of course.

362
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,270
现在又不是等价交换
There's no quid pro quo here.

363
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,470
你和你的同事们从事的研究十分杰出
You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research,

364
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,570
这笔钱是你们应得的
and you deserve the money.

365
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,820
好吧
Oh.

366
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,580
那昨晚算怎么回事
Then what was last night about?

367
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,910
我试了一把  告我啊
I took a shot; sue me.

368
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,890
好吧
Oh.

369
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,500
莱纳德  你长得真帅
You're a very handsome man, Leonard.

370
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,920
谢谢
Thank you.

371
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,900
我真傻  以为像你这样血气方刚的年轻人
It was foolish of me to think someone your age

372
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,880
会对我这样熟透的大龄熟女感兴趣
might ever be interested in someone like me.

373
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
别这么说
Oh, don't say that.

374
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,450
-你是一个很魅力的女人  -拜托
- You're a very attractive woman. - Oh, please.

375
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,080
-我是说真的  -你小嘴真甜
- No, it's true. - Well, aren't you sweet.

376
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,020
我得重申一遍
Just for the record...

377
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,250
与妾共度一夜  君将余生齿颊留香
you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.

378
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,970
那是当然
I'm sure I would.

379
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,330
不过为什么这么说
But why-why, exactly?

380
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,650
你是个聪明人
You're a very smart man.

381
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,540
你认为我得有多大的本事  才能傍上一个这么有钱的丈夫
How do you think I landed such a rich husband?

382
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,650
我还真没想过这个问题
I hadn't really given it much thought.

383
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,590
那好好想想吧
Well, think about it.

384
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,250
难不成你是指
Do you mean...?

385
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,880
正确  老娘就是有本事让男人爽
Yep. I'm that good.

386
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,770
牡丹花下死  做鬼也风流
Oh, what the hell.

387
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,670
早安  荡夫
Good morning, slut.

388
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,460
说啥呢
What?

389
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,820
拜托  我一眼就看出来了  你的步伐充满羞愧
Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it.

390
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,520
你缺少的只是花掉的睫毛膏
All you're missing is a little smeared mascara

391
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,090
和卷成一团塞在坤包里的小裤裤
and a purse with panties wadded up in it.

392
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,060
-发生什么事了  -没事
- What's going on? - Oh, nothing's going on.

393
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,960
借光
Excuse me.

394
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,890
-你才回来  -是
- Are you just getting home? - Yeah.

395
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,880
这是个好兆头  对吧
That's a good sign, right?

396
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,850
的确
Oh, yeah.

397
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,870
我为你而自豪
I'm so proud of you!

398
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,190
你就像普通站街女一样
You sold yourself out

399
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,610
出卖了自己的肉体
like a common streetwalker!

400
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,900
不  我不是为了钱而做
No, I didn't do it for the money.

401
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,880
她爽完就跑了
She stiffed you?

402
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,690
我认为应该是你的室友这么对人家吧
I believe that's what your roommate did to her.

403
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,010
搞毛啊
What?!

404
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,360
再说一遍  多读读我们给你那本书
Again, read the book we gave you.

405
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,140
不是这样的  我是说
No, I mean,

406
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,880
她一开始就把钱给我了
I-I got the money first.

407
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,580
聪明  先收钱后办事
Smart. Get paid up front.

408
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,740
我发现你有当小白脸的潜质呀  莱纳德
Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

409
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,740
我要进去歇着
I'm gonna go lie down.

410
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,190
这个主意不错  养精蓄锐
That's a good idea; get your rest.

411
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,110
外面有大把有钱又饥渴的老女人
There are a lot more rich old ladies out there,

412
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,870
而哥正好需要一台新的直线加速器
and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator.

413
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
亏我当时还觉得
And I thought he didn't

414
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,740
他没有从你们的恋爱中学到任何东西
learn anything from his relationship with you.

415
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,760
说啥呢
Hey!

416
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,870
这是赞美
Another compliment!

417
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,560
你得学着去识别
Learn to recognize them.

418
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,350
他来了
Ah, there he is!

419
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,620
当前最令人瞩目的人
The man of the hour!

420
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,020
他牺牲小我  完成大我
He took one for the team!

421
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,110
我真不是为了钱
I didn't do it for the money!

422
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,700
这样自我安慰也不错  至少能让你好过点
Keep telling yourself that-- it makes it easier.

423
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,330
相信我  我深有体会
Trust me, I know.

424
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,000
-厉害啊  伙计  你真了不起  -就是
- Cool, buddy! That's awesome! - Yeah!

425
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,700
老师太  给力不
How was she?
