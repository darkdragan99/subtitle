1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,480
晚上好  路易吉披萨[意大利语]
Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,830
晚上好[意大利语]
Buona sera.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,120
这是意大利语的"晚上好"
It means good evening in Italian.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,350
我想说  跟你解释这个问题
May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,670
让我对你们"餐厅"的正宗性产生了怀疑
the authenticity of your ristorante?

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,730
我出去了
Okay, I'm out of here.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,980
稍等[意大利语]
Un momento.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,760
我的老天爷呀
Oh, for heaven's sake.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,570
现在你是真心在装傻了吧
Now you're being deliberately stupid.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,900
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,690
我要去拉杰那儿跟普丽娅共进晚餐
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,640
我觉得霍华德也会去  你也来吗
I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,990
可今天是星期四啊
But tonight's Thursday.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,990
每个星期四大家都会过来
On Thursdays, everybody comes over here

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,080
一起吃披萨
and has pizza.

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,010
或者是看菜单挺正宗
Or a reasonable facsimile

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,140
说是由某位叫路易吉做的
prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi,

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,670
可电话里的声音却听着山寨得像成龙
but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,570
咱们今晚就不能破例一次吗
Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,620
行啊
We could.

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,260
咱今晚也可以不用字母"M"
We could also stop using the letter "M,"

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,410
但我觉得这主意挺"呼导"[误导]挺"奥残"[脑残]的
but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,100
跟我一起去拉杰家吧
Just come with me to Raj's.

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,750
我不想参加派对
Well, I don't want to go to a party.

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,620
不是派对  就是原来的一群
It's not a party. It's the same group of people

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,510
在这里聚的人今天去那里聚
who hang out here hanging out over there.

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,470
不好意思  但是五个人一起吃饭聊天就是派对
I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.

28
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,050
那为啥在咱们这儿不算派对
How come it's not a party when we do it here?

29
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,800
因为我们从来不办派对啊
Because we don't throw parties.

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,940
我不知道该怎么跟你说了  谢尔顿
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,620
我要去见普丽娅  大家都去的
I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there.

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,410
你来不来
You coming or not?

33
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,880
当然不去  知道为啥吗
Well, no, sir, and do you know why?

34
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,920
一个词
In a word:

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,110
传统
tradition.

36
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,200
在过去这八年的每个周四晚上
Every Thursday night for the last eight years,

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,900
你和我还有我们的朋友们聚在这里
you and I and our friends have gathered here

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,220
就在这里切开覆盖着起司和酱料的面包[暗指披萨]
in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce,

39
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,070
讨论当日话题
discuss the issues of the day,

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,350
没错  还有分享欢乐
and yes, share a laugh or two.

41
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,830
但我猜这些宝贵的回忆对你来说一文不值
But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.

42
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,890
你说的没错
I guess you're right.

43
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,910
-回见  -等等
- See you later. - Wait!

44
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,950
莱纳德  等等
Leonard! Wait!

45
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,450
那我晚上吃啥啊
What am I going to do for dinner?

46
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,470
跟我一起去拉杰家吃饭啊
Come with me to Raj's and eat there.

47
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,950
我可不干
I can't do that.

48
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,710
万一他做了羊杂碎和黑香肠呢
What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?

49
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,900
我对他会上这两道菜深表怀疑
I really doubt that's what he'll serve.

50
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,060
万一他做了呢
But what if he does?

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,600
我就不得不
I'll be obliged to dine

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,430
吃包在羊肚里煮熟的肝和肺了
on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach.

53
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,050
说实在的  黑香肠差不多也是一样的
And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing.

54
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,980
我不知道他为啥整这俩菜
I don't know why he's serving both.

55
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,290
你到底想干啥
What do you want to do?

56
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,330
是跟我一起去还是一个人待在家里
You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?

57
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,500
算了  我还是去你的杂碎派对吧
No, I'll go to your haggis party.

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,000
但我得跟你说
But I'm telling you.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,470
这太"轰狂"[疯狂]了  绝对是太"轰狂"[疯狂]了
This is adness. This is utter and complete adness.

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
生活大爆炸第四季第十七集

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,420
天啊
Oh, dear!

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,780
-咋了  -拉杰的电视
- What? - Raj's television.

63
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,460
我刚才意识到
I just realized

64
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,160
我们整晚都得看着
we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,410
左上角还有一坨坏点的等离子电视
with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,510
那就别看电视了呗
So don't watch TV.

67
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,590
看书吧
Read a book.

68
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,940
想显得不合群吗
And be a social pariah?

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,750
你知道那不是哥的风格
Oh, you know that's not my style.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,360
你叹气是因为懊恼  对吧
The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,620
对
Right.

72
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,140
是因为我还是坏点
Is it about me or the dead pixels?

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,950
嗨  你俩来得正好
Hey, you're just in time.

74
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,050
我们做了德墨风味的小菜
We made Tex-Mex.

75
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,050
听起来不错哦
Oh, sounds great.

76
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,430
印度佬做德墨菜啊
Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex.

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,380
还不如吃中式披萨呢
Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.

78
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,400
你来啦
Hey, you.

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,580
嗨
Hi.

80
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,370
对你来说肯定很有意思  对吧
That's got to be fun for you, huh?

81
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,960
看着霍夫斯塔德在你妹妹嘴里
Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva

82
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,700
吮吸唾液
out of your sister's mouth?

83
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,910
不好意思  在今晚开始之前
Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further,

84
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,520
我们得先定好谁坐在哪儿
we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.

85
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,360
又没有人预定座位  谢尔顿
There is no assigned seats, Sheldon.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,220
随便找个地儿坐呗  别太拘束哈
Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.

87
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,120
真有意思
Oh, what fun.

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,390
我们就像是友爱集会里的嬉皮士
We're like hippies at a love-in.

89
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,850
就坐这儿吧
Just sit here.

90
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,430
马上  哥们儿  马上
Right on, man. Right on.

91
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,070
看呐
Oh, look.

92
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,160
这不是哈利波特和百分之九十八的魔法石吗
it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.

93
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,810
好咯  这里有玉米卷饼
Okay, we've got fajitas

94
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,330
和各种配菜  你们自便吧
with all the fixins, so you make your own.

95
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,460
好极了
Wonderful.

96
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,620
晚饭  还得要自己动手的
Dinner, some assembly required.

97
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,060
想来一杯玛格丽特吗  谢尔顿
Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?

98
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,790
玛格丽特
A margarita?!

99
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,720
我们这是在哪儿啊  出什么事儿了
Where are we?! What is happening?!

100
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,650
嗨  谢尔顿
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

101
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,850
想来点儿啥
What can I get you?

102
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,760
水  纯水
Water. Neat.

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,330
再放一把小伞
With a little umbrella.

104
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,980
你的朋友们在哪儿呢
Where are all your friends?

105
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,270
可悲啊  佩妮  今晚  我就是黑暗骑士[蝙蝠侠]
Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight,

106
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,970
独自漫步在破旧的大街上
roaming these mean streets alone.

107
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,100
一件斗篷风衣披肩
A windbreaker for my cape,

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,690
帽檐下是冷峻的面庞
and a stern expression for my cowl.

109
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,650
好吧
Okay.

110
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,190
劳驾
Excuse me?

111
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,920
难道现在不是应该有一位厌世的酒保
Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep

112
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,810
心不在焉地一边擦柜台
absentmindedly wipes down the bar

113
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,050
一遍抚慰客人心中的忧愁吗
and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?

114
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,930
我只是要帮你拿那个该死的小伞  不过好吧
Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right.

115
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,960
有什么烦心事啊  伙计
What's troubling you, buddy?

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,990
我知道你是装出来的  不过既然你问了
I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked...

117
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,270
显然  因为莱纳德在和拉杰的妹妹约会
Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister,

118
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,890
我们都被迫去拉杰家里聚会
we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.

119
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,500
哦  真糟糕
Oh, the horror.

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,800
没错
Indeed.

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,470
而且啊  拉杰在放雷鬼音乐[源自牙买加]
Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music,

122
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,040
他妹妹还把鞋给脱了
and his sister took off her shoes.

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,650
简直就是卡里古拉大帝的晚年时期
It was like the last days of Caligula.
卡里古拉大帝是古罗马帝国最荒淫残暴的皇帝

124
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,670
这个我得接
Oh, I have to get this.

125
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,750
伞呢
Umbrella?

126
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,680
真不知道她有啥好恼的
Wonder what she's exasperated about.

127
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,190
嗨
Hello?

128
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,680
谢尔顿  你还好吧
Sheldon, are you all right?

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,990
我们上次通话的时候  你正准备
When last we spoke, you were going to

130
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,620
打车离开拉杰家  但是根据Facebook
take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook,

131
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,460
你刚才进蛋糕工厂了
you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.

132
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,310
对  我之前是在打车来着
Yes, I was in a taxi,

133
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,410
但是司机和他运营执照上的照片
but the driver didn't look at all

134
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,210
长得一点都不像
like the photograph on his license,

135
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,200
所以我就跳下车跑过来了
so I leapt out and ran for it.

136
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,490
明智
Wise.

137
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,630
给你
There you go.

138
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,470
就像是加勒比海边的元气恢复酒一样
Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.

139
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,960
嗨  闺蜜
Hi, bestie.

140
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,410
哦嗨  艾米
Oh. Hi, Amy.

141
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,220
最近还好吗
How you been?

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,540
很好
Fine.

143
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,050
从这个角度  我能看到你的鼻孔
From this angle, I can see up your nose.

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
是啊  活在高科技时代挺好的  对吧
Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,240
没关系  我的问题可以待会儿再说
Don't worry. My problems can wait

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,570
你们两个女人接着八卦吧
while you two hens finish your clucking.

147
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,660
听着  谢尔顿  莱纳德在和普丽娅约会
Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya.

148
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,860
她住在拉杰那儿
She is staying with Raj.

149
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,990
这就意味着你们以后很可能会经常去那儿
That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.

150
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,560
佩妮  很抱歉把你也牵扯进来
Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

151
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
我知道你伤心欲绝
I know you're devastated

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,830
你的前男友找到了一位惊艳的新欢
that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover

153
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,140
而且她的小麦色皮肤美丽无瑕
with flawless, caramel-colored skin.

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,850
我对莱纳德和普丽娅的事儿没啥郁闷的
Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.

155
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,520
但你扇动的鼻翼可不是这个意思
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.

156
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,030
继续八吧八吧
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

157
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,950
谢尔顿  看着我
Sheldon, look at me.

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,140
我觉得是时候
I think it's time

159
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,000
面对这一现实了
to face the fact

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,260
莱纳德就是你们这个小团体的中心
that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.

161
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
他去哪儿  你们就去哪儿
Where he goes, the group goes.

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,570
莱纳德是中心
Leonard the nucleus?

163
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,130
这没道理啊
That makes no sense.

164
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,580
我才是异想天开的精灵
I'm the whimsical elf

165
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,680
让大家欢乐相聚
that everyone looks to for a good time.

166
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,020
我不是说你很无聊
I'm not saying that you're not fun.

167
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,480
你是我认识的最有趣的人
You're the most fun person I know.

168
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,690
很多人觉得跟我一起很有趣
A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.

169
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,820
别耍宝了  闺蜜
Don't be needy, bestie.

170
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,590
也许正是因此莱纳德离开了你
That's probably part of what chased Leonard away.

171
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,930
我的意思是  谢尔顿
What I am saying, Sheldon,

172
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,180
你们那群人是以莱纳德为中心的
is that your group is Leonard-centric.

173
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,710
要是个小镇  就会是莱纳德镇
If it were a town, it would be Leonardville.

174
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,540
要是个伊斯兰国家  莱纳德斯坦
If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan.

175
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,600
要是电影的诞生地
If it were the birthplace of motion pictures,

176
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,190
大家都会唱着"莱纳坞精神万岁"
we'd all be singing "Hooray for Leonardwood."

177
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,640
我想到一个
Ooh, I got one.

178
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,780
如果你们是支乐队
If you guys were a band,

179
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,340
就会是莱纳德和他朋友们
you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.

180
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,230
太耍宝了
So needy.

181
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,480
你在做什么
What you doing?

182
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,610
拿点小吃出来
I'm setting out snacks.

183
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,360
今晚我们都要去拉杰家你知道的吧
You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight.

184
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,250
《诺丝·罗茜》是一本少儿读物
这小吃又不是给你的  诺丝·罗茜
I didn't say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

185
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,510
有人要来吗
You're having people over?

186
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,420
对  你一定好奇死了谁会来
Yes. Must be killing you wondering who.

187
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,900
好吧  我告诉你
Fine, I'll tell you.

188
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,170
是漫画书店的斯图尔特
Stuart from the comic bookstore,

189
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,940
同事巴里·克瑞普克
Barry Kripke from the university,

190
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,700
佩妮的前男友扎克
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack

191
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,490
演员勒瓦尔·布尔顿
and TV's LeVar Burton.

192
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,360
真的吗
Really?

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,030
勒瓦尔·布尔顿也要来吗
LeVar Burton's coming here?

194
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,040
可能  我在推特上联系他了
Possibly. I Tweeted him.

195
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,160
好吧  告诉他我喜欢他在《星际迷航》的表演
Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,600
拜托  莱纳德  别想打扰我新朋友
Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.

197
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,330
当然  晚安
Of course. Good night.

198
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,040
-莱纳德  -什么
- Leonard. - Yeah?

199
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,590
之前你我共度了许多美好时光
We had a good run, you and I.

200
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,370
好--吧
Okay.

201
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,360
但变化本就是人生的一部分
But change is a part of life.

202
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,330
当然是
It certainly is.

203
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,810
好了
Okay.

204
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,110
我有客人要来
I have guests coming.

205
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,610
恐怕得请你赶紧走了
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.

206
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,470
我正要走了
I am leaving.

207
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,600
别让离别变得更加不舍  莱纳德
Don't make this harder than it is, Leonard.

208
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,780
再见  谢尔顿
Good-bye, Sheldon.

209
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,720
你也再见  先生
And good-bye to you, sir.

210
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,270
他会回来的
He'll be back.

211
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,380
我当然会回来  我住这儿
Of course I'll be back. I live here!

212
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,440
好吧  看来
Well, it would appear

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,960
勒瓦尔·布尔顿是不会来了
LeVar Burton won't be joining us.

214
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,810
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

215
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,320
开始先在屋里四处走走
I thought we'd begin by going around the room,

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,620
介绍下自己
introducing ourselves

217
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,030
稍微说下自己为何来这
and saying a little bit about why we're here.

218
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,340
好了  我是谢尔顿
Okay. I'm Sheldon.

219
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,630
对于经常阅读
Uh, for regular readers

220
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,740
《新英格兰高能物理学》杂志的人来说
of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics,

221
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,470
我不需要介绍自己了
I need no introduction.

222
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,620
如果你不熟悉那本刊物
If you're not familiar with that publication,

223
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,920
礼品袋里有免费样书赠送
there's a free copy in your goody bag.

224
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,130
斯图尔特
Stuart?

225
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,670
大家好  我是斯图尔特
Um... Hi. I'm Stuart.

226
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,550
我开了家漫画书店
I run a comic bookstore,

227
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,750
因经济原因  我最近还住在店里
which for financial reasons, I'm currently living in.

228
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,670
我今晚到这最希望的是能洗个热水澡
I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.

229
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,720
很好  斯图尔特
It's very nice, Stuart.

230
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,740
扎克
Zack?

231
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,920
我是扎克  我呃...
I'm Zack, and I'm, uh...

232
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,490
这...
uh...

233
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,880
我等下再说行吗
Could you come back to me?

234
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,830
当然
Of course.

235
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,730
巴里
Barry?

236
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,830
我是巴里·克瑞普克  我来这里
I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here

237
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,170
是因为你说今晚会有"凑奖"
because you told me there was going to be a whaffle.

238
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,030
凑奖什么时候开始
When is the whaffle?

239
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,610
淡定  淡定  巴里
Patience, patience, Barry.

240
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,510
凑奖...
The whaffle...

241
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,060
抽奖是持续整晚
The raffle is the grand finale

242
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,770
玩乐放荡的压轴大戏
to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.

243
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,340
-还有个问题  -对  你一定会抽得到
- One more question... - Yes, you must be present to win.

244
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,980
好了  我准备好了
Okay, I'm ready.

245
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,840
我是扎克  我呃...
I'm Zach, and I'm, uh...

246
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,850
讨厌  为什么这么难
Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

247
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,490
嗨
Oh, hey.

248
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,260
-嗨  -好啊  宅女
- Hi. - Yo, P-dog.

249
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,240
有事吗
What's up?

250
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,790
我们来绑架你出去过女生之夜
We're here to kidnap you for a girls' night out.

251
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,550
说明一下  所谓"绑架"是开玩笑的
Parenthetical: the term "Kidnap" is being used playfully.

252
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,530
我知道的
I kind of figured that.

253
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,180
很好  那就把这枕头套套上去
Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.

254
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,310
不要
No.

255
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,330
她以前比这有趣多了
She used to be much more fun,

256
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,280
直到莱纳德狠狠伤了她的心
until Leonard punched her in the heart.

257
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,200
我们认为你应该想出去
We just thought you might want to go out

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,610
好好玩一下  或者去跳跳舞
and have a good time, maybe go dancing.

259
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,250
天  谢谢  可我现在没心情
Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.

260
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,030
你要知道  沉醉到其他各种
You do understand that it will distract you

261
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,290
甜蜜可爱事情上  能让你不去注意
from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving

262
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,110
你的前男友
that your ex-boyfriend

263
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,150
正得到孟买火热宝贝的青睐
is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

264
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,780
好吧
Okay, look,

265
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,110
我要是同意跟你们出去玩
if I agree to go out with you guys,

266
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,620
你们要保证不拿莱纳德和普丽娅的事烦我
will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?

267
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,930
-好的  -当然
- Yes. - Sure.

268
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,770
好吧  我去换衣服  进来吧
All right. I'll go change. Come on in.

269
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,840
你要是让我带了哥罗芳[迷药]
If you'd have let me bring the chloroform,

270
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,110
我们就不必说刚才那么多废话了
we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.

271
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,430
总之  我们滑雪滑累了之后
Anyway, after we get done snowboarding,

272
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,650
我就回旅馆  泡极可意按摩浴缸了
I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

273
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,960
周围没有人  所以我自然就让蛋蛋出来呼吸了
There's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it.

274
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,390
然后
Next thing I know,

275
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,800
有位美女突然出现
this beautiful chick shows up,

276
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,130
喝得醉醺醺地  想跟我共浴
drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.

277
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,150
提问
Question.

278
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,240
那是极可意浴缸还是热水浴缸
Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

279
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,140
你坑爹呢?  就想问这个?!
Really? That's your question?

280
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,150
有什么区别
What's the difference?

281
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,060
极可意浴缸是种商业品牌
"Jacuzzi" is a commercial brand.

282
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,020
热水浴缸是通用术语
"Hot tub" is the generic term.

283
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,090
就是说  所有极可意都是热水浴缸
I.E., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs,

284
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,960
但并非所有热水浴缸都是极可意
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

285
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,540
是不是就像所有拇指都是手指
Is that like all thumbs are fingers,

286
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,990
但并非所有手指都是拇指
but not all fingers are thumbs?

287
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,690
没想到啊  是的
Surprisingly, yes.

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,770
很好
Nice.

289
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,660
那脚趾到底是什么
Now, what exactly are toes?

290
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,140
能否跳回去继续说那醉妞
Can you please get back to the drunk girl?

291
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,520
我洗澡的时候需要点想象的灵感啊
I'd like something to think about in the shower.

292
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,110
对了
Oh, yeah.

293
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,210
总之  她也脱光光了
Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes,

294
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,630
爬进了热水浴缸  我首先注意到的是...
climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice...

295
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,650
水面上升了
The water level rose.

296
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,280
不是
No.

297
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,210
水位当然要上升
Of course it did.

298
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,940
据说阿基米德
It's said that Archimedes,

299
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,520
古希腊数学家
the ancient Greek mathematician,

300
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,530
就是泡澡时发现了浮力定律
discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.

301
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,570
太棒了  继续说  扎克
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.

302
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,940
光光的醉妞  光光的蛋蛋  继续
Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.

303
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,080
抱歉  但我觉得你们会发现
Forgive me, but I think you'll find

304
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,990
我的故事更有趣
my story is more interesting.

305
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,440
你的故事里也有沾露娇乳吗
Does yours have wet breasts in it?

306
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,560
比这更好
Better.

307
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,130
里面有个金冠
It has a gold crown.

308
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,950
国王想知道金冠中有多少黄金
You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it

309
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,510
让阿基米德想个办法测出来
and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution.

310
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,680
因为金冠形状不规则
Because the crown was irregularly shaped,

311
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,950
无法用数学计算出体积
there was no way to mathematically determine its volume.

312
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,850
但在泡澡时  阿基米德突然想到
But, while bathing, Archimedes realized

313
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,520
可以把金冠浸入水中
he could immerse the crown

314
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,580
量出水面上升的数值以计算体积
and measure the amount the water rose.

315
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,430
长话短说  我上了她
So, long story short, I nailed her.

316
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,330
想出来后  他高叫着"我找到了"[希腊语]
When he finished, he shouted "Eureka!"

317
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,530
不  我总是叫"天哪"
No, I always shout, "Holy moly!"

318
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,100
不知道为什么  反正就这么叫
Don't know why. Just do.

319
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,080
好吧
All right,

320
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,880
今晚的"让我们了解你"部分到此为止
that concludes the "Getting to know you" Portion of the evening.

321
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,780
谁想来玩些复古游戏
Who's ready to play some vintage video games?

322
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,720
今晚的选择包括
And tonight's selections include

323
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,120
ColecoVision的"蓝精灵救援之格格巫城堡"
ColecoVision's "Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle,"

324
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,540
雅达利的"饼干怪兽大口嚼"[是一款《芝麻街》电玩]
Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch,"

325
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,580
以及给你们这种文字冒险游戏迷准备的
and for you text adventure aficionados,

326
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,050
"索克"
"Zork."

327
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,110
选我选我  我可好玩啦
Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.

328
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,310
里面那个长毛大肉球可恶心了
That all sucks the big hairy meatball.

329
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,120
我去把我车上的卡拉OK机拿出来
How about I go get the karaoke machine out of my car,

330
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,640
喝个酩酊大醉  然后把放声高歌把屋顶掀飞  怎么样
get plastered and blow the roof off this place?

331
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
很好  我负责买啤酒
Great, I'll make a beer run.

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,960
那我负责去洗澡
And I'll take a shower.

333
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,480
15分钟后见
We'll meet back here in 15.

334
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,780
就这么定了
Check.

335
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,800
我负责不高兴
I'm unhappy.

336
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,310
真好吃
This is delicious.

337
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,070
你这辣椒汤在哪儿学的
Where'd you learn to make chili?

338
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,020
我在英国读大学的时候
When I was at university in England,

339
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,430
我室友是得克萨斯州人
my flatmate was from Texas.

340
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,650
希望她不跟我那位得克萨斯室友一样
I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.

341
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,310
谢尔顿有点古怪  对吧
Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?

342
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,340
拜托  回顾那个混蛋疯子的人生
Oh, please. That crazy bastard's looking

343
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,960
全都是古怪这个词儿呢
at quirky in the rearview mirror.

344
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,690
你们知道吗  我们的室友协议里面规定
Did you know that, per our roommate agreement,

345
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,570
我必须在洗澡前先把脚洗干净
I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower?

346
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,760
而且还不能在水池子里洗
And not in the sink.

347
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,970
所以我们各有一个特制的小桶
We each have special buckets.

348
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,730
拉杰  你有告诉过你妹妹
Raj, did you ever tell your sister

349
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,710
谢尔顿曾被比尔·盖茨扁过吗
about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?

350
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,460
-天啊  你开玩笑呢吧  -真的
- Oh, God, you're kidding. - Nope.

351
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,150
盖茨来大学里演讲
Gates gave a speech at the university.

352
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,890
结束后  谢尔顿走过去跟他说
Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said,

353
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,190
"如果你不是为非洲的病童
"Maybe if you weren't so distracted

354
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,810
那么劳神的话
by sick children in Africa,

355
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,870
或许你能有多一点想法  好好弄弄Windows Vista"
you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista."

356
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,490
砰  正中鼻头
Bam. Right in the nose.

357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,300
顿时让我觉得  拥有一台电脑是多么骄傲的事情
Made me proud to own a PC.

358
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,960
我提议为今晚举杯欢庆
I'd like to propose a toast

359
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,030
为这完全摆脱谢尔顿的珍贵而美妙的夜晚
to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.

360
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,550
-说得对  -干杯
- Hear, hear. - Cheers.

361
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,920
你们发现这是破天荒头一遭  我们举杯欢庆
You realize that's the first time we've ever done that

362
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,530
而不被谢尔顿强迫科普
without having to listen to Sheldon tell us

363
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,080
何为祝酒吗
why it's called a toast?

364
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,690
那何为祝酒
Why is it called a toast?

365
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,940
古罗马人
Oh, the ancient Romans

366
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,700
把香喷喷的面包片放到他们的酒碗里
put spiced toast in their punch bowls.

367
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,420
谢尔顿解释得更好
Sheldon tells it better.

368
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,040
-好像是  -的确是
- He kind of does. - Yeah.

369
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,410
该死的  我想他了
Aw, hell, I miss him.

370
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,010
那你们想去哪里跳舞
So, where do you guys want to go dancing?

371
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,010
我们希望你会知道个好地方
We were hoping you'd know a place.

372
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,820
对  或许那里上演着
Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly

373
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,330
一场超棒的肉体狂欢会
with young, beautiful bodies

374
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,840
紧身的衣服藏不住年轻美丽的躯体
sweating and writhing against each other

375
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,070
大家挥洒着汗水  相互扭成一团
in a glorious orgy of the flesh.

376
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,640
没错  我是知道这么个地方
Oh, yeah, I know that place.

377
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,620
这身怎么样
What do you think?

378
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,080
应该能充分展示你的胸襟
That should display enough of your bosom

379
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,860
好吸引一个新男友  或是一个饥饿的婴儿
to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.

380
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,630
够了  我再跟你们重申一次
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

381
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,120
只因莱纳德有了新女友
Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend

382
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,900
并不意味着我要出去勾引一个新男友
does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.

383
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,950
但如果你想你就可以  不是吗
But you could if you wanted to, right?

384
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,640
话是这么说  没错
Well, yeah, I guess.

385
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,140
从房间里挑选出一位最辣的猛男
Pick out the hottest guy in the room,

386
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,500
把他带回家  跟他做一些不能说的秘密
take him home, do unspeakable things to him,

387
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,710
然后让他面带微笑  臀带牙印
then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face

388
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,180
滚到路边
and teeth marks on his heinie?

389
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,770
差不多吧
More or less.

390
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,310
那是种怎样的滋味呀
What's that like?

391
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,060
我也说不清
I don't know.

392
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,350
当你做的时候  乐在其中
It's fun while you're doing it.

393
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,780
但过后  大多时候会尴尬
And then after, it's mostly embarrassment,

394
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,300
自我厌恶和后悔
self-loathing and regret.

395
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,260
我愿意整天都享受这种滋味
I would take that deal all day long.

396
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,750
好吧  但今晚不会发生这种事
Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight.

397
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,210
这是我人生中第一次
You know, for the first time in my life,

398
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,810
不谈恋爱
I am not in a relationship,

399
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,440
我也完全觉得没有关系
and I'm totally okay with it.

400
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,750
如果独自一人对你来说很新鲜
You know, if being on your own is new to you,

401
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,440
我很乐意跟你分享一些  我这么多年来爱用的
I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques

402
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,140
解除空窗期紧张的女士专用科技产品
for ladies I've perfected over the years.

403
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,660
比如  你有电动牙刷吗
For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?

404
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,550
没有
Um, no.

405
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,320
那你应该买一个
You should get one.

406
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,560
那是什么
What's that?

407
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,330
好像是保存的某些东西
It appears to be something preserved

408
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,390
夹在两片丙烯酸树脂之间
between two pieces of acrylic.

409
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,300
那是来自北极的雪花片
Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole.

410
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,480
莱纳德去年给我的
Leonard gave it to me last year.

411
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,990
天啊  真浪漫
Oh, God, that is so romantic.

412
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,740
是呀  曾经是
Yeah, it was.

413
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,340
莱纳德真是独一无二的情种
Leonard's really one of a kind.

414
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,880
一边拿着雪花一边说这话
Saying that while holding a snowflake

415
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,230
不觉得手上的东西有点儿沉么
is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?

416
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,200
让我看看
Let me see that.

417
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,610
去它的破雪花
Oh, screw it.

418
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,990
一点半点的自我厌恶  姐还是能处理的
I can deal with a little self-loathing.

419
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,280
走吧  找个小翘臀让姐咬一口
Let's go find me a heinie to bite.

420
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,530
人才呀
Outstanding.

421
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,440
如果失败了  我们可以在CVS停车
And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS

422
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,890
然后给你买个厉害的电动牙刷
and pick you out a nice toothbrush.

423
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,340
我管我的牙刷叫"杰拉德"
I call mine "Gerard."

424
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,980
这有点太怪了
That's kind of creepy.

425
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,820
Elton John & Kiki Dee《Don't Go Breaking My Heart 》
* 不要让我心碎 *
* Don't go breaking my heart *

426
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,250
* 如果我奋力一搏  结果也枉然 *
* I couldn't if I tried *

427
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,110
* 亲爱的  如果我焦躁不安 *
* Oh, honey, if I get restless *

428
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,040
* 宝贝  你不是这种人 *
* Baby, you're not that kind *

429
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,620
* 不要让我心碎 *
* Don't go breaking my heart *

430
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,700
有人唱《走在阳光里》了吗
Anybody do "Walking on Sunshine" Yet?

431
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,510
没有
No.

432
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,000
那我定啦
Dibs.

433
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,260
抱歉  你是说谢尔顿买了台织布机
I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom

434
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,520
然后学习织布吗
and learned how to weave?

435
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,890
他其实学得挺好的
He actually got pretty good.

436
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,150
他给我们都做一件相配的毛毯
He made us all matching serapes.

437
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,020
每当寒风刺骨的时候  我还会拿出来披上
I still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.

438
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,580
那是在他养那25只猫
Now, was this before

439
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,650
的之前还是之后
or after he adopted the 25 cats?

440
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,540
在养猫很久之前
Long before the cats.

441
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,930
我觉得好像是在他试着宣告
I think it was around the time he tried

442
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,040
我们的公寓是个主权国家的那段时间
to declare our apartment a sovereign nation.

443
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,890
我至今还留有些货币呢
I still have some of the currency.

444
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,620
我的朋友们
All my friends.

445
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,440
我的朋友们
All my friends.

446
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,970
我的朋友们
All my friends.

447
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,730
我觉得就跟《 阴间大法师》一样
I think it's like Beetlejuice.

448
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,800
咱们刚才总是念叨谢尔顿
We said his name too many times.

449
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,360
-快进来  -谢谢
- Come on in. - Thank you.

450
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,800
我还以为你跟你的新朋友在一起呢
Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.

451
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,250
我必须得离开
I had to leave.

452
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,240
他们的玩乐方式有误
They were having fun wrong.

453
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,060
过来  谢尔顿  跟我坐
Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.

454
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,310
谢谢
Thank you.

455
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,950
你来点私房辣椒汤吗
Would you like some homemade chili?

456
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,020
汤里有豆子吗
Are there beans in it?

457
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,950
有
Yes.

458
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,170
那就不是辣椒汤
Then it's not chili.

459
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,400
地道的辣椒汤是没有豆子的
Real chili has no beans in it,

460
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,930
但由于你是来自异乡人
but you're from a foreign land,

461
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,140
你的无知可以被谅解
so your ignorance is forgiven.

462
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,240
谢尔顿  你要还是不要
Sheldon, do you want some or not?

463
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,730
要  谢谢
Yes, please.

464
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,160
你女人的脾气有点毛躁呀
Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.

465
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,210
我提议举杯欢庆
I'd like to propose a toast

466
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,490
致朋友们  不管他有多古怪
to friends, no matter how quirky.

467
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,000
干杯
Cheers.

468
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,890
普丽娅  你知道何为祝酒吗
Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?

469
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,340
这我还真知道
Actually, I do.

470
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
是罗马人把香喷喷的面包
I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast

471
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,060
放进他们的酒碗里
in their punch bowls.

472
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,650
她还有点假装博学多闻
She's also a bit of a know-it-all.

473
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,110
这挺好吃的
Mmm. This is good.

474
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,910
先不管地不地道吧
Whatever it is.

475
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,040
Katrina & The Waves《Walking On Sunshine》
* 我走在阳光里 *
* I'm walking on sunshine *

476
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,900

* I'm walking on sunshine *

477
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,800
你好  我
Hello? I...

478
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,060
* 我走在阳光里 *
* I'm walking on sunshine *

479
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,360
我还是走吧
Oh, I don't think so.

480
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,880
推特什么的玩儿蛋去吧
I am so done with Twitter.
