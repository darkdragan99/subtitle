1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,340
好的  我准备好答下道题目了
All right, I'm ready for my next question.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,070
在一个犀牛被当宠物养的世界中
In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
谁将赢得第二次世界大战
who wins the Second World War?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,480
乌干达
Uganda.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
理由
Defend.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,950
肯尼亚会因出口犀牛而崛起
Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,150
在中非成为一个强大的政权
A Central African power block is formed,

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,260
并殖民统治北非和欧洲
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,690
战争爆发后  谁也负担不起养犀牛的这份奢侈
When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,060
肯尼亚衰落  乌干达雄起
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,200
回答正确
Correct.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
轮到我了
My turn.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,540
在一个钢琴被当做武器而不是乐器的世界中
In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,340
美国黑人作曲家及钢琴家
斯科特·乔普林会用什么来演奏《枫叶爵士》
on what does Scott Joplin play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,110
调谐刺刀
Tuned bayonets.

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,180
理由
Defend.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,110
理由不是显而易见吗
Isn't it obvious?

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,680
你说得对  我的错
You're right. My apologies.

19
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,720
你们俩在玩什么鬼游戏呢
What the hell are you guys playing?

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,460
这是我们发明的一个游戏
It's a game we invented.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,660
我们称它为"反事实游戏"
It's called Counterfactuals.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,030
我们假定一个在某关键方面不同于这里的世界
We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,260
然后互相就此发问
in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,200
本游戏适合8至80岁人士
It's fun for ages eight to 80.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,630
一起来玩吧
Join us.

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,140
好吧
All right.

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,600
我也喜欢脑筋急转弯
I like a good brainteaser.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
我来试试吧
Give it a whirl.

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,770
你走运了  这道简单
You're in luck, this is an easy one.

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,350
在一个人类被高智商巨形海狸统治的世界中
In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver,

31
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,810
哪种食物再也吃不到了
what food is no longer consumed?

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,720
BLT[培根生菜番茄三明治]吗  其中B代表海狸
Uh... a BLT where the "B" stands for beaver?

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,950
我也说不准
I don't know.

34
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,020
莱纳德  认真点
Leonard, be serious.

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,790
我们在玩游戏呢
We're playing a game here.

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,890
我能答出来的  让我想想
I can figure this out. Let's see.

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,660
海狸以树皮喂食
Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,070
我唯一了解的人类用得着树皮的食物是肉桂
The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon.

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,370
所以我说是肉桂
So, I'll say cinnamon.

40
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,400
错误
Incorrect.

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,910
答案很明显是芝士丹麦酥
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

42
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,240
你说啥
What?

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,980
在一个被巨形海狸统治的世界中
In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,250
人类为取悦海狸的统治会修建许多水坝
mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord.

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,650
哥本哈根因地势低洼会遭遇洪灾
The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded.

46
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,920
数万人会死去
Thousands die.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,990
更毁灭的是  丹麦人却从未以自己的名字给糕点命名
Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry.

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,190
怎么会有人连这个都想不到呢
How does one miss that?

49
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,960
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,400
你们这是在捏造答案
You're just making stuff up.

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,230
他输的时候总这样吗
Is he always like this when he loses?

52
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,630
那当然了
Oh, yes.

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,470
你要是能目睹08年讨论巨形野牛时的景象就好了
You should've been here for the great giant tantrum of 2008.

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,540
你掀的桌子  自己清楚
You bumped the table and you know it.

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,580
或许我们应该玩个更适合他能力的游戏
Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities.

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,390
等会儿你躲猫猫的时候  我们会闭眼数到10
We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.

57
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,860
我回屋了
I'm going to my room.

58
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,720
很好  莱纳德
Very good, Leonard.

59
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,090
但下次你藏哪里无需提前告诉我们
But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,170
生活大爆炸第四季第三集

61
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,970
你们看到《美国物理学报》关于超固体的论文了吗
Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids?

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,830
挺有趣的
It's pretty interesting.

63
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,410
这个人从假说...
This guy's working from a hypothesis where...

64
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,410
剧透警报  剧透警报
Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

65
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,180
-咋了  -别提前爆料
- What?  - Don't ruin it for me, man.

66
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,010
我为了边蹲便壶边看把PDF文件都打出来了
I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

67
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,120
便壶  你多大了  五岁吗
On the potty? What are you, five?

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
就是便便的地方嘛  不然你说该叫什么
It's a potty. What do you call it?

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
厕所
Toilet.

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,250
晚饭桌上这么叫不觉得有点粗俗了吗
That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?

71
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,360
那"便壶"就不俗了吗
Oh, and "potty" is okay?

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,490
"便壶"多纯真  多可爱啊
"Potty" is innocent. "Potty" is adorable.

73
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,260
那你去便便的地方干啥  嘘嘘吗
What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,600
如果我不必"嘣嘣"[大便]的话
If I don't have to boom-boom.

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,970
各位好
Greetings.

76
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,140
你们都记得艾米·菲拉·福勒吧
You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

77
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,340
-见到你很高兴  -你好
- Nice to see you.  - Hello.

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,870
抱歉我们迟到了
Sorry we're late.

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,440
对此我必须得承担责任
I must take responsibility.

80
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,110
我不得不半路上买点女性卫生用品
I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.

81
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,280
-这样啊  -了解
- Aha.  - Okay.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,440
我认为她正在经期当中
I believe she's experiencing her menses.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
实际上  还没到时候
Actually, I'm not.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,450
但为了避免意外  我得时刻带着卫生巾
In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.

85
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,650
-理解  -非常了解
- Aha.  - Okay.

86
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,020
厕所现在听起来顺耳多了是吧
"Toilet's" sounding pretty good now, huh?

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,460
瞧啊  这不是谢米嘛
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

88
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,490
谢米
Shamy?

89
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,660
一个幼稚地混合我们名字的做法而已
A juvenile amalgamation of our names.

90
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,200
谢尔顿  艾米  "谢米"
Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,530
这样啊
Oh.

92
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,570
我不喜欢  以后别这么叫了
I don't like that. Don't do that.

93
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,670
好吧  有什么新鲜事吗
All righty. What's new?

94
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,470
我刚才得知你称呼我们为"谢米"
Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy,

95
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,470
而我并不喜欢
and I don't like that.

96
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,110
我了解了  但我想问的其实是你生活上的新鲜事
I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?

97
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,910
跟普通人没什么两样
Like everybody else's.

98
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,050
经历着万物的成长  衰败和最终的死亡
Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death.

99
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,720
谢谢你的问候
Thank you for asking.

100
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
为何她还没有给我们点餐呢
Why is she not taking our order?

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
我应该提前通知你的
I should've warned you,

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,190
如果想在这里用餐前  必须要经历连串
one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense

103
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,860
繁杂而无用的寒暄
before one can be fed here.

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,900
是吗  我以为既然起名叫芝士"工厂"
Really? I assumed an establishment called

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,700
做事就能更有效率呢
the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.

106
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,000
那是它们诱骗你来的伎俩
It's how they lure you in.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,270
我想这应该称为"诱饵推销法"
I believe it's called "bait and switch."

108
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
好吧  我还是遁走好了
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

109
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,240
因为  我不想待在这了
'cause... I don't want to be here.

110
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,180
这真不错啊
So, this is nice.

111
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,020
我们第一次齐聚一堂来吃顿饭
First time we've all gotten together to eat.

112
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,320
你说得对  他果然在进行无聊的饭前寒暄
You're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,290
好吧  我没辙了
Okay, that's all I got.

114
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,560
霍华德  你上
Howard, you're up.

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,060
谈谈你的工作吧  艾米
Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

116
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,760
我怀疑你听不听得懂
I doubt you'd understand.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,500
谢尔顿告诉我你只有个硕士学位
Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,900
拉杰  你有没有问题问艾米
Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?

119
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,310
我很好奇  我们怎么不单独吃饭
I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.

120
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,380
他们离不开我
They can't function without me.

121
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,220
我是凝聚这个小团体的粘合剂
I'm the social glue that holds this little group together.

122
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,690
不用谢我
You're welcome.

123
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,960
我能跟你谈谈你的女朋友吗
Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?

124
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
她不是我的女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

125
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,690
她是女生  也是我朋友
She's a girl and she's my friend,

126
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,430
但绝对没有触摸或不洁的交换唾液
but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.

127
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,300
明白
Got it.

128
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,270
不过  倒是有一次
Although, for the record, on one occasion,

129
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,910
她舔了一下拇指  然后帮我抹掉
she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly

130
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,770
嘴角上的树莓果冻
from the corner of my mouth.

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,180
我们今天都为此后悔不已
It's an action we both regret to this day.

132
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,280
明白
Uh-huh.

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,610
不过  我觉得她不太适合
Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit

134
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,250
我们这个  怎么说呢  反抗军[星球大战]
for our little-- how should we call it-- rebel alliance.

135
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,650
我一直不认同反抗军
Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance.

136
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,060
尽管他们想建造死亡星球
Despite their tendency to build Death Stars,

137
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,320
我一直支持银河帝国
I've always been more of an empire man.

138
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,260
那不是我想说的
Yeah, not my point.

139
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,500
我知道你想说什么
I know what your point is.

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,530
你们被艾米的智慧吓着了
You're intimidated by Amy's intellect.

141
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,000
我只能说  振作点
To that I say, buck up.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
我直接说吧
Okay, let me just get right to it.

143
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,640
艾米很爱批评人  假正经  而且
Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly...

144
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,910
很讨人厌
just obnoxious.

145
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,680
那又如何
So?

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,050
我们已经要忍受这样一个你了
So we already have you for all that.

147
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,650
你这是建议我停止和艾米交往吗
Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?

148
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,050
不  当然不是
No, no, of course not.

149
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,160
只是去别的地方交往
Just have your relationship someplace else.

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,760
那我可得指出  我忍气吞声整整八个月
May I point out that for eight long months,

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,630
忍受你女朋友在咱家
I suffered in silence as your female companion

152
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,700
大声唱跑调的乡村音乐
filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling,

153
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,380
毫不知羞地在咱客厅
the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone

154
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,440
用浮石磨长满老茧的脚
against her calloused feet in our living room,

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,420
一夜接一夜地看
and night after night of uninformative

156
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,380
毫无内涵的电视剧《泽西海滩》
TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,680
忍气吞声
Suffered in silence?

158
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,690
没错
Yes.

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
我希望你也能这么做
And I'd thank you to do the same.

160
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,890
有没有搞错  忍气吞声
Reall-- Silence?!

161
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,770
落基山脉清凉的泉水
Nothing makes beer taste better

162
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,870
最能带出啤酒的味道
than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water.

163
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,570
话说  落基山脉在哪啊
Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?

164
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
费城[实际不是]
Philadelphia.

165
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,480
真的吗
Really?

166
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,910
我以为在西部呢
I thought they were out West someplace.

167
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,050
这样想  拉杰
Think about it, Raj.

168
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,420
电影《洛奇》的故事发生在哪里
Where did the movie Rocky take place?

169
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,990
费城
Philadelphia.

170
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,960
我明白了
Okay, now I get it.

171
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
这就是咱的计划吗
So this is the plan?

172
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,780
从今天起
From now on,

173
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,460
我们就藏这里躲避谢米吗
we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?

174
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,060
我觉得这里很舒服
I'm very comfortable here.

175
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,600
佩妮亲爱的  再给我来一剂"万灵弹"吧
Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?

176
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,640
自己拿去
Get one yourself.

177
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,910
某人吃了泼妇药哦
Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.

178
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,540
老天  他喝了酒真混蛋
God, he's an ass when he drinks.

179
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,910
他没喝酒也混蛋
Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

180
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,110
你只是没听到
You just don't hear it.

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,050
我们得考虑谢米恋
Think we need to start entertaining the possibility

182
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,920
发展数年的可能性
that the Shamy could go on for years.

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,620
那样的话  佩妮得装卫星电视
Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV

184
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,320
而且每周吸一吸灰尘
and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.

185
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,360
你不是要跟谢尔顿谈吗
I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.

186
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,230
-谈了  -他怎么说
- I did.  - Well, what'd he say?

187
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,370
他指出他过去有点必须
Well, he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to...

188
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,840
忍受你
put up with you.

189
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
有点必须
Kinda sorta had to?

190
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,110
我没同意他的说法
I didn't agree with him.

191
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,110
你帮我反驳了吧
Well, you defended me, right?

192
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,940
我试了  不过
I tried, but...

193
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,250
他说的理由太充分了
...he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.

194
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,520
你磨得不对
You're not doing that right.

195
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
什么
What?

196
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,750
给我
Gimme.

197
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,990
-不要  -相信我
- No.  - Trust me.

198
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,690
-不要  -我一直帮我妈磨脚
- No!  - I do this for my mom all the time.

199
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,860
看到没
See?

200
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,000
要顺着纹路摩
With the grain.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,600
哇  确实好很多
Wow, that is better.

202
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,040
改天  你要是得了静脉曲张
And someday, when you have varicose veins,

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,940
我再教你怎么推拿
I'll show you how to massage them.

204
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,880
天呐  没有下次了
Oh, God, never again.

205
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,850
你的"没有下次"应该是指不再
I assume by "never again," you mean never again will you drink

206
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,250
喝完佩妮的啤酒后跑去加油站
all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station

207
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,450
买两瓶40s啤酒  一盒肉条
for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims

208
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,390
还有最新一期的《孟买美妞翘臀》吧
and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.

209
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,560
人家想家了嘛
I was homesick.

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,660
当晚最精彩的就是你展示
The highlight of the evening was when you showed us

211
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,760
你的宝莱坞霹雳舞技
your Bollywood break dancing skills.

212
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,510
你这样很没礼貌
That's very offensive.

213
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,610
没错  我们当时也这么想
Yeah, we all thought so.

214
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,910
晕
Oh, no.

215
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
怎么了
What?

216
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,280
约翰和洋子来了[列侬夫妇]
It's John and Yoko.

217
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,020
更像洋子和洋子
More like Yoko and Yoko.

218
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,720
大家好
Greetings. Hey.

219
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,950
我带了艾米来
I brought Amy here

220
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,190
看看我的工作
to show her some of the work I'm doing.

221
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,590
对于理论工作来说  很不错了
It's very impressive, for theoretical work.

222
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,730
我好像察觉出一点屈就的意味
Do I detect a hint of condescension?

223
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,930
抱歉  我说得太间接了吗
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

224
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,370
我是指跟神经生物学
I meant compared to the real-world applications

225
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,400
在现实中的应用相比  理论物理就是
of neurobiology, theoretical physics is--

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
怎么说好呢  小巫见大巫
what's the word I'm looking for?-- hmm, cute.

227
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,310
你这是暗指神经生物学家的成就
Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist

228
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,680
巴宾斯基  法国神经学家
例如巴宾斯基  能上升到物理学家
like Babinski could ever rise to the significance

229
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,020
克拉克·麦克斯韦：经典电动力学创始人  狄拉克：量子力学奠基者之一
例如克拉克·麦克斯韦或狄拉克的层面
of a physicist like Clark Maxwell or Dirac?

230
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,720
直截了当地说
I'm stating it outright.

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
巴宾斯基把狄拉克当早餐
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,620
再排泄出克拉克·麦克斯韦
and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

233
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,630
你给我收回那话
You take that back.

234
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,500
绝不
Absolutely not.

235
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,730
我和同事们正在绘制
My colleagues and I are mapping

236
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,700
神经基质  有利于
the neurological substrates that subserve

237
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,870
促进全球信息处理
global information processing,

238
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,970
这种研究既要求认知推理
which is required for all cognitive reasoning,

239
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,670
也包括科学探索  由此事实可见
including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto

240
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,010
我的研究在认知序列上更高一层
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

241
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,710
这就说明比他的研究更高级
That means it's better than his research,

242
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,710
由此可推  当然也胜过你们
and by extension, of course, yours.

243
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,520
不好意思  我的大脑
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

244
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,820
还停留在理解排泄克拉克·麦克斯韦上
to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so...

245
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,360
不好意思  但是统一场理论
Excuse me, but a grand unified theory,

246
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,930
在一定程度上解释了万物
insofar as it explains everything,

247
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,000
由此事实可见  也能解释神经生物学
will ipso facto explain neurobiology.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
是没错  但要是我成功了
Yes, but if I'm successful,

249
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
我就能绘制和再现你演算出
I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes

250
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,010
统一场理论的思维加工过程
in deriving a grand unified theory,

251
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,870
因此  你的结论也得纳入我的范式
and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.

252
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,410
那是卑劣的心理主义
That's the rankest psychologism,

253
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,810
早在19世纪90年代就被费雷格
and was conclusively revealed as hogwash

254
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,950
板上钉钉为是胡言乱语
by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

255
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,050
看来我们陷入了僵局
We appear to have reached an impasse.

256
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,720
同意
I agree.

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,360
我决定立即终止我俩的关系
I move our relationship terminate immediately.

258
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
赞同
Seconded.

259
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,460
还有异议吗
There being no objections...

260
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,900
那么立即执行
...the motion carries.

261
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,870
日安  艾米·菲拉·福勒
Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

262
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,870
日安  谢尔顿·库珀
Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

263
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,880
女人哈
Women, huh?

264
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,410
没法和她们过日子
Can't live with them,

265
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,810
也没法反驳她们的各种假设
can't successfully refute their hypotheses.

266
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,980
上帝保佑
Amen to that.

267
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,750
好呀  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

268
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,390
你好
Hello.

269
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,320
听说你和艾米分手了
I hear you broke up with Amy.

270
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,760
说"分手"的话就说明她是我女朋友
A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend.

271
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
她是个女孩  曾经是我朋友
She was a girl who was my friend

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
现在她还是个女孩  但不是我朋友了
who is now a girl who is not my friend.

273
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,400
听着像史上最烂乡村民谣
Wow. That's like the worst country song ever.

274
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,670
你感觉如何
So, how are you doing?

275
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,940
什么感觉
Regarding what?

276
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,080
和艾米分手
Amy.

277
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,180
我不懂
I don't follow.

278
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,420
分手...不管你怎么叫  总是很难受的
Well, breakups-- or whatever the hell this is-- can be tough.

279
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
佩妮  放心  我没事
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

280
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,590
我和艾米只是纯粹智力上的关系
My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual,

281
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,030
没有丝毫感情色彩
There were no emotional bonds,

282
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,360
所以我也没有任何痛苦
the severing of which would cause me any discomfort.

283
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,030
这段关系只是失去效用罢了
The relationship simply outlived its utility,

284
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,000
我也像从前一样继续生活
and I'm continuing on with my life as before.

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
好吧  不错
Okay. Good.

286
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,740
我得先走了  要去买一只小猫咪
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a pussycat.

287
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,610
这事儿必须跟你们说一下
I gotta tell you guys,

288
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,180
我有点担心谢尔顿
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

289
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,010
我们都有点担心谢尔顿
We're all a little worried about Sheldon.

290
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,050
我是说自从谢米恋搁浅后
No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.

291
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,320
我还以为你是一概而论呢
Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization:

292
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,750
"我担心谢尔顿  可能他某天"
"You know, I'm worried about Sheldon

293
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,960
会因为在咖啡馆吃不到酸橙果冻
"someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device

294
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,690
就去引爆一个低爆炸力核装置
because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."

295
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,090
搁浅是啥意思
What does "hit a reef" mean?

296
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,630
一拍两散
Uh, went splitsville.

297
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,630
啥
Pardon?

298
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,200
就是"屎了"
Turned to boom-boom.

299
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,440
我觉得谢尔顿真的很想念艾米
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,710
你该把你的那本《孟买美妞翘臀》借给他
You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.

301
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,880
他找了只猫作伴
He got a cat to keep him company.

302
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
不是吧
You're kidding.

303
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,150
他上哪儿都带着
He takes it everywhere:

304
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,980
不管是卧室还是洗手间
to bed, to the bathroom.

305
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,950
他带猫咪用便壶吗
He takes the kitty to the potty?

306
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,550
我们不是说好不用这词儿了么
I thought we discussed the P-word.

307
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,120
别想着改变我  老兄
Don't try to change me, dude.

308
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
哥就是哥
I am what I am.

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,430
先生们
Oh, gentlemen.

310
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,490
不给我们介绍下
Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us

311
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,160
你的小伙伴吗
to your little friend?

312
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,630
不好意思
My apologies.

313
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,400
拉杰  霍华德  这位是罗伯特·奥本海默博士
Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

314
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,670
你好
Hello. Hi.

315
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,940
失陪一下
Now, if you'll excuse me,

316
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,480
原子弹之父现在要来一碟牛奶
the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.

317
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,580
我懂了  的确该担心谢尔顿
Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.

318
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,050
是吧
Yeah.

319
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,490
回来了
Hey.

320
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,020
不是吧
Oh, no.

321
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,630
奥本海默太孤单了
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

322
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,160
美国制造原子弹计划的代号
所以你要把整个曼哈顿计划的人都找来吗
So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?

323
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,200
对  这位是恩里科·费米  理查德·费曼
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman,

324
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,970
爱德华·泰勒
Edward Teller,

325
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,300
奥托·弗里希
Otto Frisch

326
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,170
还有犀利哥
and Zazzles.

327
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,270
什么鬼名字
Zazzles?

328
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,510
我本想给他取名为赫尔曼·冯·赫尔姆霍兹
I was going to name him Hermann von Helmholtz,

329
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,640
但他实在太犀利了
but he's so zazzy.

330
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,820
好吧  我们得谈谈
Okay, we need to talk.

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,050
谈什么
About what?

332
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,690
猫呗  谢尔顿
Cats, Sheldon.

333
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,690
显然艾米走后  你很难受
You're clearly upset about Amy being gone,

334
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,890
所以你想用一堆猫来代替她
and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.

335
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,490
-一群猫  -啥
- Clowder. - What?

336
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,860
不用一堆  而要用一群  或者是一窝子
A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.

337
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,900
好吧  我懂了
Okay, yeah, fine.

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,600
既然我们现在与猫为伍
It's the kind of thing you ought to know

339
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,270
我觉得有必要给你扫盲一下
now that we have one.

340
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,540
很好很强大  我的意思是
Terrific. My point is, you need to face up

341
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,510
你得坦然面对这次分手
to what you're feeling with this breakup.

342
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,740
这不是分手
It wasn't a breakup.

343
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,640
那样的话就说明她是我女朋友
A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.

344
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,180
好吧  我知道了  她不是你女朋友
Okay, I got it, I got it; she's not your girlfriend.

345
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,550
听我说
Now listen to me.

346
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,120
我知道孤单一人的感觉
I know about loneliness.

347
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,450
也明白要借其它事物来寻求安慰
I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff.

348
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,350
我那会和佩妮分手后  我又重新开始拉大提琴
When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello,

349
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,460
还搭了不少模型火箭
I built a bunch of model rockets,

350
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,990
我还买了举重手套和五磅重的哑铃
I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,360
你那不叫分手  是佩妮甩了你
You didn't break up, she dumped you.

352
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,300
她才没甩了我
She didn't dump me.

353
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,700
这是互相的
It was mutual!

354
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,370
我就在场  是她甩了你
I was there. She dumped you.

355
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,740
好吧  随你吧
Okay, fine.

356
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,040
跟猫一起住吧
Live with cats.

357
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,310
跟我南希姨妈一样
Be like my Aunt Nancy.

358
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,670
她就跟几十只猫一起住
She had dozens of them.

359
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,140
你知道她死后怎么样了吗  猫把她给吃了
And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.

360
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,810
不用再跟说服我喜欢猫了  莱纳德
You don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard.

361
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,050
我已经喜欢了
I'm already a fan.

362
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,720
好了小家伙们  谁想来吃点珍喜猫罐头
All right, fellas, who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?
Fancy Feast[珍喜]：普瑞纳公司出的猫粮罐头

363
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,990
这可一点都不喜人
Well, that's not fancy at all.

364
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,470
你好  库珀夫人  谢谢你赶来
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

365
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,530
他人呢
Where is he?

366
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,700
在他卧室
He's in his bedroom.

367
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,900
你在电话里说的
Now, when you said on the phone

368
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,410
他跟个女孩分手了  是指真的女孩吧
he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl,

369
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,910
不是什么你们在实验室造出来的那种
not something you kids whipped up in a lab?

370
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,440
不  是真的人
No, she's real.

371
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,480
他们做了违反教规的事吗
Did they sin?

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,510
不  不是那样的
No, no, it's not like that.

373
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,620
是...
It's, uh...

374
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,320
我不知道怎么描述
I don't know what it's like.

375
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,250
但有些事  请你作好心理准备
But there is something I should prepare you for.

376
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,920
放心吧莱纳德  他是我一手拉扯大的
Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy.

377
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,460
最好的我见过  最坏的我也见过
I've seen him at his best, I've seen him at his worst.

378
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,100
没什么能让我吃惊的了
There's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.

379
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,930
话别说这么早
Hold on to that thought.

380
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,730
请进
Come in.

381
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,710
吃惊吧
Surprise.

382
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,510
妈  真是意外之喜
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

383
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,350
天  好大一股味
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

384
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,350
向你引见奥本海默  弗里希  潘诺夫斯基
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky,

385
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,090
费曼  维斯可夫
Feynman, Weisskopf...

386
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,250
好了  我明白了
Yeah, I get it.

387
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,020
你养了很多猫
You got a lot of cats

388
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,060
还给它们起了可爱的犹太名字
and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

389
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,930
你来这干嘛
What are you doing here?

390
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,160
莱纳德打电话给我的
Leonard called.

391
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,400
他说你为伊人消得人憔悴
And he said that you were pining for a young lady.

392
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
那太可笑了
Oh, that's preposterous.

393
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,230
我才没有为谁憔悴
I'm not pining over anyone.

394
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,340
哦小羊排  我的说法或许不合适
Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it,

395
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,910
但我们都同意  这事儿让人毛骨悚然
but I think we can both agree it's creepy.

396
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,010
我才不同意
I do not agree.

397
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,380
猫是很好的伙伴
Cats make wonderful companions.

398
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,650
不会跟你吵  也不会质疑你的才智权威
They don't argue or question my intellectual authority,

399
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,520
还有这个小家伙
and this little guy here,

400
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,790
你们会发现它实在太犀利了
I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

401
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,560
你真该早点打给我的
You should have called sooner.

402
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,900
谢利  吃饭了
Shelly! Dinner's ready!

403
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,930
来了
Coming!

404
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,200
不许带猫
No cats!

405
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,170
她来这干嘛
What is she doing here?

406
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,470
我打给她的
I called her.

407
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,510
你妈妈认为
Your mother thinks

408
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,480
你可能正因我失魂落魄
you might be losing your mind over me.

409
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,110
作为神经生物学家  我很好奇
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

410
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,820
放心  我心智完全正常
Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.

411
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,920
25只猫
25 cats!

412
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,220
上帝保佑你  亲爱的
Oh, God bless you, dear.

413
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,590
谢尔顿  坐下  我们谈谈
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

414
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,390
好吧  但不许骗我
All right, but you're not fooling me.

415
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,630
每次你说我们谈谈
Whenever you say we have to talk,

416
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,860
都只许你说我听
it means you want me to listen.

417
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
那就闭嘴
Then stop talking.

418
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,670
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

419
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,770
我找艾米过来的原因
Now, the reason I called Amy over was

420
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,340
是想看看她是哪种人
to find out what type of person she is.

421
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,010
跟她聊了一会后
And after chatting a bit,

422
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,340
我不得不说  虽然她是个
I have to say that while she is a

423
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,850
绝对  特殊的女士
perfectly unique young woman,

424
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,350
你们俩完全不适合对方
you two are definitely not suited for each other.

425
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,150
这结论真奇怪
That's a peculiar conclusion.

426
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,620
不管以任何标准来衡量  艾米都比我认识的任何人
By any standard, Amy is more similar to me

427
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,920
跟我更像
than anyone I've ever met.

428
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,720
抱歉谢利  我看不出来
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.

429
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,630
你看不看得出来没关系
Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant.

430
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,630
我也看不到亚原子粒子
I can't see subatomic particles,

431
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,500
但不论任何  它们就是存在的
but nevertheless, they're there.

432
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,600
绝妙的观点
Excellent point.

433
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,330
且是物理学观点
A physics point.

434
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,870
讲得好
Touche

435
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,210
别卖弄拉丁话了
Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

436
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,040
很高兴看到
it's a good thing that

437
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,010
你们决定分手
you two decided to end the relationship

438
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,450
就省得我来拆散你们了
so I didn't have to end it for you.

439
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,480
艾米  再三考虑之后
Amy, after consideration,

440
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,680
我觉得我们可能决定得太草率了
I believe we may have acted rashly.

441
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,550
我建议我们重新开始
I propose we resume our relationship

442
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,060
并尝试解决双方差异的障碍
and attempt to resolve our differences.

443
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,990
除非你认可  我俩之间
I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate

444
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,090
80%的障碍都是你造成的
that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.

445
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,900
-我只认可占40%  -你占65%
- I'll go as high as 40. - Sixty-five.

446
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,430
成交
Done.

447
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,430
你明白我们继续的话
You understand that moving forward,

448
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,900
我们得面对我妈并不认可你的现实
we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?

449
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,870
我明白  我发现扮演个
I do. I find being cast

450
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,570
坏女孩的角色  竟让我很兴奋
in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.

451
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,980
想看看我的猫吗
Would you like to see my cats?

452
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,110
想  我喜欢猫
I would. I love cats.

453
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,450
它们是独善其身的典范
They're the epitome of indifference.

454
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,250
你会发现犀利哥有点烦人
Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.

455
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
我可算看出来了
I saw what you did there.

456
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,190
他一向自以为聪明
He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

457
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,590
其实跟其他人没什么不同
He's no different from any man.

458
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,510
你让他们别去做什么
You tell 'em not to do something,

459
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,930
他们就想做什么
certainly that's all  they want to do.

460
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,430
要不是我让我弟弟矮胖墩
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

461
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,400
别用手去清理碎木机
not to clear out the wood chipper by hand,

462
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,970
他就不会有这外号  还是爱德华了
we'd still be calling him Edward.

463
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,740
还有  你坐着别动
Now, don't you move.

464
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,340
我来把菜搬过来
I'll bring over all the food.

465
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,440
不不不  我来就行
No, no, no, I can do it.

466
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,440
真是太给力了
Well, isn't that sweet?

467
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,180
谢谢你  艾米
Thank you, Amy.

468
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,690
给  你的猫
Here's your cat.

469
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,490
还有你的20美元
And here's your $20.

470
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,120
下一个
Next!

471
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,060
谢谢你  艾米
Thank you, Amy.

472
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,260
给你你的猫
Here's your cat.

473
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,100
还有你的20美元
And here's your $20.

474
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,630
下一个
Next.
