1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,390
有问题吗
Problem?

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,800
这是我吃过最难吃的脆皮水果派
This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,970
味道就跟出自一个初级的补鞋匠之手一样
It tastes like it's made of actual ground-up shoemaker.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,540
真好笑  "cobbler"一词两意都点到了
Amusing. A play on the two meanings of "cobbler."
cobbler既有水果派也有鞋匠的意思

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,780
伙计们  猜猜我在洛杉矶机场发现谁了
Hey   guys. Guess who I found at LAX?

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,110
我的妹妹普丽娅
My baby sister Priya.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,280
抱歉  我反对
Excuse me   I object.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,480
你提出的是一个猜谜游戏
You propose a guessing game

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,450
可是你一点猜的时间都不给我
yet you don't give me enough time to guess.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,090
声明一下  我本来就打算说
For the record   I was going to say:

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,350
"你的妹妹普丽娅"
"Your sister Priya."

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,920
谢尔顿  你一点都没变  对吧
Oh   Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit   have you?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,030
我为什么要变
Why would I change?

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,190
她的本意其实是
The hope has been that

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,260
你最终能变得正常一点
you'd eventually bend to public opinion.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,400
普丽娅  什么风把你吹来洛杉矶
So   Priya   what brings you back to L.A.?

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,530
我本来要去多伦多  但我得在这滞留一天
I have a one-day layover on my way to Toronto.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,940
企业并购
Corporate merger.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,040
你们相信吗
Can you believe it?

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,400
小普丽娅是印度最大汽车公司
Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,840
首席律师之一
for the biggest car company in India.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,880
鉴于当时咱们见面  她已经从法学院毕业了
Given that when we met her   she was finishing law school

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,250
而且正打算去一家大的印度汽车公司实习
and planning an internship at a large Indian car company

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,150
这个结果其实相当合理
it's actually extremely plausible.

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,620
你怎么就这么惹人嫌呢
And your poll numbers just keep dropping.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,920
虽然我很想跟大家一起聊聊
I want to catch up with all of you

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,660
但我得先去上个厕所
but first I really must visit the loo.

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,820
我也去  我给你指路吧
I'm going   too; I'll show you where it is.

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,090
好的  虽然这不用明讲
All right   this goes without saying

30
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,790
但是无论如何我还是重申一下
but I'm just going to say it anyway.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,060
不许碰我妹妹
Hands off my sister.

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,900
我干嘛碰她  她浑身布满了飞机细菌
Why would I touch her? She's covered with airplane germs.

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,540
我当然不是跟你说  我是跟他说
I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,240
-喂  我都是有女朋友的人了  -拜托
- Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.  - Oh   please.

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,040
我的妹妹比你那女友辣多了
My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,310
这点你心知肚明
and you know it.

37
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,250
她们俩都很辣行了吧
Let's just agree they're both hot.

38
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,420
但是伙计  你说的可是我妹妹
But dude   that's my sister you're talking about!

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,190
算了  不说这个话题
Okay   forget who's hotter.

40
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,220
普丽娅第一次来洛杉矶时  我和莱纳德
The first time Priya came to L.A.   Leonard and I made a pact

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,920
出于对我们友情以及对你的尊敬
out of respect to our friendship and to you

42
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,030
我们约定  谁也不能泡你妹妹
that neither of us would hit on her.

43
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,660
你们拉钩钩了吗
Did you pinky-swear?

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,130
当然
Yes.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,870
那好吧
Okay   then.

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,000
补鞋匠的水果派  我到现在还忍不住发笑
Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,370
真高兴再次见到你 莱纳德
It's really nice to see you again   Leonard.

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,480
是啊  我也很高兴见到你
Yeah. It's good to see you   too.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
你到了
Here you go.

50
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,650
谢谢
Thanks.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,520
哇哦  哇哦  哇哦
Whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa!

52
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,690
继续
Okay.

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,080

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,990
生活大爆炸第四季第六集

58
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,990
你跟你的妹妹有什么特别计划吗
So you got any special plans with your sister?

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
没有  就是一起出去玩
Oh   not really. Just hang out.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,070
我总是跟人说  如果你只能在
I always tell people   "If you have only one day

61
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,640
洛杉矶呆一天  火车一日游是最佳选择
in Los Angeles   make it a train day."

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
火车一日游
Train day?

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,810
乐趣始于在影城的卡尼餐厅吃早午饭
The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City

64
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,950
在改造过的铁路餐车里  有一个热狗站
a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car.

65
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,880
下一站  Travel Town
Next stop   Travel Town

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,380
一家户外的博物馆  专门展出1880年至1930年的
an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines

67
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,990
铁路引擎  汽车  和其他轨道车辆
cars   and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s.

68
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,960
最后  我们在浮华与魅力并存的好莱坞下车
And   finally   we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,860
对  就在好莱坞的卡尼餐厅吃晚饭
for dinner at--that's right-- the Hollywood Carney's

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,730
那是另外一个改造过的铁路餐车热狗站
a hotdog stand in a <i>different</i> converted railroad dining car.

71
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,840
我们才不会玩这个
I don't think we're going to do that.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,270
显然  你讨厌寻乐
Well   then apparently you hate fun.

73
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,710
普丽娅还没回来呢
Priya's not back yet?

74
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,180
这很正常
Well   I guess that's not unusual.

75
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,580
女人  男人  一个蹲着一个站着
Women   men   the whole sitting-standing deal.

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,050
咱们刚才聊到哪里了
So what are we talking about?

77
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,720
我和普丽娅的出游计划
Uh   my plans with Priya.

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,690
他拒绝火车一日游
He rejected Train Day.

79
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,260
你有说清楚那是两辆不同的火车车厢
Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars

80
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,130
改造成的热狗站吗
turned into hotdog stands?

81
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,860
十分清楚
Abundantly.

82
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,760
我想他就是讨厌寻乐
I guess he just hates fun.

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
我也是这么说的
That's what I said!

84
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,010
好了  你们有什么新闻
Okay   so... what's new with you guys?

85
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,440
我有女朋友了
I have a girlfriend now.

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,810
不错嘛
Hey   good for you!

87
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,480
嗯  我就想让大家都知道
Yeah   I just want to put it out there

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,540
以防我不经意
in case I inadvertently

89
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,310
朝你喷射出我的性引诱外激素
squirt any pheromones in your direction.

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,250
满意了吧
Happy?

91
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,890
普丽娅  你有什么安排吗
So   Priya   what are your plans while you're here?

92
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,890
我不知道  我只有一天时间
I don't know. I just have the one day.

93
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,090
你喜欢火车吗
Do you like trains?

94
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,560
不是特别喜欢
Not particularly.

95
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,730
那你在机场上等着登机就好了
You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.

96
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,940
你在一片森林当中
"You are in a forest.

97
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,610
在西面  有一片流沙
"There is quicksand to the west

98
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,640
有一条通向东面的路
a path leads to the east."

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,350
去东面
Go east.

100
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,280
一道铁门挡住了你的路
"An iron gate blocks your way."

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,020
开门
Open gate.

102
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,520
上锁了
"It's locked."

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,690
这样啊
Hmm.

104
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,860
那算了
Well   so much for that.

105
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,060
很晚了  你怎么还不睡
It's getting pretty late. How come you're still up?

106
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,100
我刚在网上发现了一款游戏模拟器
I found an emulator online that lets you play classic text-based

107
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,570
可以玩上世纪80年代的经典文字游戏
computer games from the 1980s.

108
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,000
不错啊
That's pretty cool.

109
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,410
当然了  因为它用到了世界上最强大的图像处理器
Oh   yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip:

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,680
想象力
imagination.

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,480
你倒是真该好好发掘一下
You've really got to get out more.

112
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,520
向北走
Go north.

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,690
你不能走这条路
"You can't go that way."

114
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,420
向西走
Go west.

115
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,820
巨魔挡住了你的道路
"A troll blocks your passage."

116
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,130
好吧  系好你的安全带
Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

117
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,760
剿灭巨魔
Kill troll.

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,400
用什么
"With what?"

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,500
用剑
With sword.

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,470
你没有剑
"You don't have the sword."

121
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,640
天呐  这种倒霉事真降临到我头上了
Good golly   it's as if it's actually happening to me.

122
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,440
拉杰总算上床睡了
Raj finally went to bed.

123
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,850
可谢尔顿还没睡
Sheldon's still up.

124
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,620
你跟我说过他九点会睡的
You said he goes to bed at 9:00.

125
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,320
他的确应该睡了  但他刚痴迷于一款电脑游戏...
Yeah   he does   but he got caught up in a computer game and...

126
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,050
用斧头击杀巨魔
Hit troll with axe!

127
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,420
用斧头击杀巨魔
Hit troll with axe!

128
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,090
用斧头击杀巨魔
Hit troll with axe!

129
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,500
服了  这真是个顽强的巨魔
My   this is one tough troll.

130
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,160
你没法摆脱他吗
Can't you get rid of him?

131
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,970
根据以往经验  不可能
If the past is any indication   no.

132
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,140
莱纳德  我陷进流沙里了
Leonard   I'm trapped in quicksand!

133
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,970
这斧头在拖我下去呢
The axe is dragging me down!

134
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,070
扔掉斧头
Drop axe!

135
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,610
扔掉斧头  英明
Drop axe   brilliant!

136
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,950
稍等一下
Give me a minute.

137
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,450
-谢尔顿  -等一下
- Sheldon. - Hold on.

138
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,450
我正在思考如何能拿到桶
Trying to figure out how to get the bucket

139
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,920
这样我就能扛着泥土越过那条龙了
so I can carry the mud past the dragon.

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,260
-谢尔顿  你还得早起工作呢  -我知道
- Sheldon   you need to work in the morning. - I know!

141
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
那还不赶紧睡觉
Well   then bed   mister!

142
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,600
再给我五分钟嘛
Five more minutes!

143
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
你确定吗
Really?

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,230
你打算冒着在热力波动学研讨会上打瞌睡的
You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your

145
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,500
风险继续玩下去吗
thermodynamic fluctuations seminar?

146
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,900
你知道自己在公众面前打哈欠的后果吧
You know what happens when you yawn in public.

147
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,310
大家都会看着我形态奇异的小舌头
Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.

148
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,350
你也不想看到这个画面吧
You don't want that   do you?

149
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,580
不想
No.

150
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,420
但我们社会嘲笑奇异舌头的做法是可耻的
But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated.

151
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
刚才谁敲门了
Who was at the door?

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
呃  楼管员
Uh   building manager.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,830
他们要来修个管子
They have to fix a pipe

154
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,500
所以明天中午到下午两点会停水
so the water'll be off tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,030
这是让人无法接受的
That's unacceptable.

156
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,470
我们理应提前得到书面通知的
We're supposed to be given written notice.

157
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,270
没关系的  反正我们到时候也是在工作的
Well   no   it doesn't matter-- we'll be at work.

158
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,140
如果我不小心把番茄汤撒到衣服上怎么办
What if I spill tomato soup on my shirt

159
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,510
我必须回家来换
and have to come home to change

160
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,870
结果发现没有水来泡洗衣粉吗
only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak?

161
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,980
别忘了分叉的小舌头  谢尔顿
Bifurcated uvula   Sheldon!

162
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,880
那我明天吃鸡肉面吧  晚安
I'll have the chicken noodle. Good night!

163
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,450
我们一定得注意小声点
We're going to have to be very quiet.

164
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,130
我想到如何拿到桶了
I know how to get the bucket!

165
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,090
我可以反过来握斧头
I can turn the axe around

166
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,630
然后用斧头把钩到水桶
and use the handle to reach it.

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,600
让我试试
Let's see.

168
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,040
向北走
Go north.

169
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
你现在身处森林
"You are in a forest."

170
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,340
继续向北走
Go north.

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,770
你仍然身处森林
"You are in a forest."

172
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,210
再往北走呢
Go north.

173
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,880
你还是身处森林  天呐  我想我迷路了
"You are in a forest." Oh dear   I believe I'm lost.

174
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,950
我还是明天从头再玩吧
Well   I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.

175
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,850
不不不  你刚才只不过方向搞错了而已
No   no   no! You just took a wrong turn.

176
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,320
你只要把图画出来就行了
You just need to map it out.

177
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
来吧  我来帮你
Come on   I'll help you.

178
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,520
你停在了小溪旁  然后向北走了三次对吧
So you stopped at the stream   and you turned north three times?

179
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,260
是的
Yes.

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
你说对了  你是迷路了  祝你好运
You're right. You're lost. Good luck.

181
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,900
莱纳德  醒醒
Leonard. Wake up.

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
抱歉
Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

183
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,430
抱歉什么啊
For what?

184
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,870
我也不知道  只要我跟女孩子同床共枕后
I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl   it's just--

185
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,770
这就是我的条件反射应答
it's my go-to response.

186
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,770
已经六点了  我得在拉杰睡醒
It's 6:00. I have to get back to Raj's

187
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,610
发现我不见了之前  赶紧回去了
before he wakes up and realizes I'm gone.

188
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,980
哦  那好吧
Oh. Right. Sure.

189
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,510
我真希望你能在洛杉矶待久点
I wish you could stay in L.A. a while longer.

190
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,510
我也想啊
Mmm   me   too.

191
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,050
知道吗  我刚才一直在想
You know   I was thinking

192
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,950
印度其实也有这么多先进的实验设施了
there are some great research facilities in India.

193
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,760
你想说什么  莱纳德
Where are you going with this   Leonard?

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,530
我其实想说  反正我在这也没啥牵挂
Well   I'm just saying   you know   I don't have any real ties here

195
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,730
我也可以搬去新德里[印度城市]  我们可以一起  你懂得
so if I were to move to New Delhi   we could   you know--

196
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,600
出去玩玩
go out.

197
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,240
莱纳德  我们五年前不就谈过这个了吗
Leonard   didn't we have this conversation five years ago?

198
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,200
是这样的  但是...
Well   yes   but...

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
今非昔比了嘛
things have changed.

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
你也长大了  我也长大了
You know   you're older   I'm older--

201
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
看吧  再也没什么漫画英雄的床单了
Look   no more superhero bed sheets.

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,710
亲爱的
Sweetheart

203
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,710
我们在一起很愉快  并不意味着
just because we have fun when I come to town doesn't mean

204
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,320
我想要开展一段正式的感情生活
I want to have a serious relationship.

205
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,680
-不想吗  -不想
- It doesn't? - Mm-mm.

206
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,950
此外  我永远也不可能介绍个白种男孩给我的父母
And besides   I could never bring a white boy home to my parents.

207
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,020
他们宁愿要头牛
They'd have a cow.

208
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,660
这在印度可就很大件事了
Which is a much bigger deal in India.

209
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,090
我也没很纯的白人血统啦
I'm not that white.

210
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,160
我的高祖母有一半彻罗基[印第安族]血统
My great-great-grandmother was half Cherokee.

211
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,230
我知道虽然不是真正的印度血统  但也算印什么了啊
I know that's not the right kind of Indian   but it is something.

212
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,930
你真有趣
You're funny.

213
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,270
莱纳德
Leonard?

214
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,440
莱纳德
Leonard?

215
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,940
莱纳德
Leonard?

216
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,810
啥事
What?

217
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,410
我听到了女人的笑声
I heard a woman laughing.

218
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,810
哦  我刚才想试试自己能否笑得像个女人
Oh   uh   yeah. I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.

219
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,450
哦  那做的不错啊  很真实啊
Oh! Well   good job. Quite convincing.

220
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,920
我闻到了香水味
I smell perfume.

221
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,990
空气清洗剂的味道
Air freshener.

222
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,560
你这脸颊和脖子上是口红吗
And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck?

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,890
是疹子  很严重的疹子
Rash. That's a bad rash.

224
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,490
深表同情
My sympathies.

225
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
我很了解这种红色祸害  也就是皮炎
I'm no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis.

226
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,000
我在我的乳液和软膏系列里
Can I interest you in a topical steroid

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,970
帮你找一种管用的类固醇好吗
from my lotion and unguent collection?

228
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,970
好啊  好啊  这主意不错
Uh   yeah   yeah   that sounds great.

229
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,140
很好  我相信我可以找到
Very well. I'm sure I can find something

230
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,880
帮你止痒的东西
that will help you ditch that itch.

231
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,020
好了  他去洗手间了  我们走
Okay   he's in the bathroom. Let's go.

232
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,690
你喜欢软膏还是霜剂
Do you prefer ointment or cream?

233
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,090
霜剂
Cream.

234
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,430
要不要含麻醉添加剂的
With or without a numbing agent?

235
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,430
不要
Without.

236
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,830
真的吗  莱纳德
Really   Leonard?

237
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,500
有皮炎的时候可不能逞英雄
There are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.

238
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,450
好吧  那就要
Fine. With.

239
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,430
处方药还是非处方的强效药
Prescription or non-prescription strength?

240
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,870
发挥你的判断力吧
Use your best judgment.

241
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,640
我有一支很不错的2009年的肛泰软膏
Well   I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,040
通常是针对严重发炎的痔疮的
It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids

243
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,310
但是对非粘膜器官也管用
but it also goes nicely with non-mucosal body parts.

244
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,450
听起来不错
Sounds great.

245
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,090
明智的选择
Excellent choice.

246
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,500
好了  快点  快点  快点
Okay   hurry   hurry   hurry.

247
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,140
快走  快走  快走
Come on   come on   come on.

248
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,580
普丽娅
Priya?

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,090
早上好  谢尔顿
Good morning   Sheldon.

250
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,170
羞耻呀  莱纳德  羞耻
For shame   Leonard   for shame.

251
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,640
我居然还差点准备
And to think   I was ready to waste

252
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,930
把我最后一点好用的痔疮霜浪费在你身上
the last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you.

253
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,150
挺开心的啊
Making pretty good time   huh?

254
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,780
你真的想说这个吗  莱纳德
Is that really what you want to talk about   Leonard?

255
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,530
不是
No.

256
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,500
那你想说什么
What do you want to talk about?

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,630
拜托别跟任何人说
Please don't tell anyone

258
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,100
我跟拉杰的妹妹过夜了
I spent the night with Raj's sister.

259
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
说出来了
There it is.

260
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,970
要是有人问起来呢
What if someone asks?

261
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,570
没人会问我是不是跟拉杰的妹妹过夜了
No one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.

262
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,680
或许吧  但是他们可能会问我别的
Perhaps   but they might ask me something else.

263
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,010
-比如呢  -比如说
- Like what?  - Like

264
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,600
莱纳德最近有没有做出背叛朋友的行为
"Has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"

265
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,690
普丽娅和我都是成年人了
Priya and I are both adults.

266
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,390
我没有背叛拉杰
I didn't betray Raj.

267
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,880
你有  但是我指的是霍华德
In fact   you did   but I was referring to Howard.

268
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,030
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

269
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,030
2005年4月12日
April 12   2005.

270
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,100
在图卢卡湖的鲍勃大头娃汉堡店里
Bob's Big Boy   Toluca Lake.

271
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,700
拉杰第一次把普丽娅介绍给我们
Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time.

272
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,840
她正在享受印度教禁止的美味食物
She was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion

273
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,610
那就是鲍勃超级大头娃牛肉堡
in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

274
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,020
为了维护你们的友谊
In order to preserve your friendship

275
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,080
你和霍华德发拉钩钩说
you and Howard made a pinky swear

276
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,410
你们俩人都不许追求她
that neither of you would attempt to woo her.

277
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,460
我点了一份奶酪牛肉片
I had a patty melt.

278
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,490
好吧  我背叛了霍华德
Okay   fine   I betrayed Howard.

279
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,420
-还有拉杰  -好的  还有拉杰
- And Raj.  - All right   and Raj.

280
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,500
还有我
And me.

281
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,650
你
You?

282
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,430
你违反了室友协议中
Violation of the Roommate Agreement's

283
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,830
有留宿客人要提前通知之一条款
overnight guest notification clause.

284
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,700
好吧  我是个令人讨厌的家伙
Okay   fine   I-I'm a horrible human being.

285
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
我就是帕萨迪纳的达斯·维达
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
《星球大战》中的重要角色  黑武士

286
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,500
你当达斯·维达还太矮了点
You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

287
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,880
你最多也就是叛徒伊渥克[星球大战]
At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

288
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,740
我只是想说  普丽娅已经走了
My point is: Priya's gone and it would be much better

289
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,450
要是没人知道这件事就最好了
if no one else found out about us.

290
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,310
你是说你想让我帮你保密
You mean you want me to keep a secret?

291
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,350
是的
Yes.

292
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,020
你知道我是保守不了秘密的
You know I can't keep a secret.

293
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,090
你努力尝试的话就可以的
You can if you try.

294
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,320
就这样想
Think about it this way:

295
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,220
如果我是蝙蝠侠  你是艾尔福
um   if I were Batman and you were Alfred
蝙蝠侠的管家

296
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,160
你一定可以对我的身份保密  对吧
you'd keep that secret   right?

297
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,960
凭什么你是蝙蝠侠
Why do you get to be Batman?

298
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,100
因为蝙蝠侠才有身份的秘密呀
Because Batman has the secret.

299
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,930
艾尔福也有秘密的
Alfred has secrets   too.

300
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,500
-什么秘密  -艾尔福知道
- Like what?  - Alfred knows

301
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,170
芭芭拉·科尔顿是蝙蝠女
that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl.

302
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,300
而我刚刚就把这个秘密告诉了蝙蝠侠
Which I've now just told to Batman.

303
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,990
你看  我就是保守不了秘密
See   I cannot keep a secret.

304
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,240
挞哒
Ta-dah!

305
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,880
什么
What?

306
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,220
挞哒
Ta-dah.

307
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,250
这是
It's short for...

308
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,220
哒哒哒哒的缩减版
Da-da-da-da! ?

309
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,850
谢尔顿  我正忙着呢
Kind of busy here   Sheldon.

310
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,190
我知道  所以我才缩减了
I know   that's why I shortened it.

311
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,720
你想干吗
What do you want?

312
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,430
我是来给你提供昨晚的不在场证明的
I came to go over your alibi for last night.

313
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,860
什么不在场证明
What alibi?

314
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,130
你让我替你撒谎  而你也知道
You've asked me to lie on your behalf   and as you know

315
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,140
我很讨厌没有提前准备的谎言
I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty

316
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,470
所以我就给你准备了不在场的铁证
so I've provided you with an ironclad alibi.

317
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,140
你昨晚不可能跟普丽娅过夜
You couldn't have spent last night with Priya

318
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,210
因为你跟另一个女人在一起
because you were with another woman.

319
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,450
我一定会后悔的
Oh   I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this

320
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,550
但我还是要问  我跟谁在一起
but who was I with?

321
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,650
风趣但作风随便的麦琪·麦凯瑞小姐
The fun-loving and morally loose Miss Maggie McGarry.

322
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,090
天啊
Oh   God.

323
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,040
你们是在帕萨迪纳最有名的
You met her at Pasadena's most popular

324
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,520
爱尔兰酒吧  幸运鲍德温酒吧认识的
Irish watering hole   Lucky Baldwin's

325
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,630
麦琪是那里的吧台服务员
where Maggie spends her nights tending bar

326
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,830
她一头卷发  心怀梦想
with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.

327
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,940
莱纳德  想要苟合的话就打给我
"Leonard   call me if you are interested in coitus.

328
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,570
麦琪·麦凯瑞敬上
Sincerely   Maggie McGarry."

329
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,870
如果真的有人
And if anyone were

330
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,780
打这个号码查证的话  他们会听到
to actually call that number   they will hear this.

331
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,880
祝你有个美好的早晨
Top of the morning to you.

332
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,050
这里是麦琪·麦凯瑞家
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

333
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,420
在轻盈的哔声后请留言
Leave a message after the wee little beep.

334
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,820
很真吧
It's pretty convincing   huh?

335
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,090
那都不是真人发声
That wasn't even a real person.

336
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,360
最后还有
And here is the clincher:

337
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,000
一撮麦琪的红棕色头发
a lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,270
你这是从哪弄来的
Where'd you get that?

339
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,070
从灵长类实验室的红毛猩猩身上剪的
From an orangutan in the primate lab.

340
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,170
红毛猩猩
An orangutan?

341
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,270
又没人会去验DNA  莱纳德
Well   no one's going to run a DNA test on it   Leonard.

342
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,340
说真的  你想得太多了
Honestly   you overthink everything.

343
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,650
谢尔顿  我不需要不在场证明
Sheldon   I don't need an alibi.

344
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,420
只要你不乱说话
Nobody's going to ask about last night

345
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,850
没人会问昨晚的事的
as long as you just zip your lip.

346
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,460
谢了
Thank you.

347
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,790
别担心  不会有事的
Now   don't worry   everything is going to be fine.

348
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,790
强烈怀疑

349
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:39,740
好啊
Hey.

350
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,970
莱纳德  你能不能告诉霍华德
Hey   Leonard   will you please tell Howard

351
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,110
我妹妹从没喜欢过他
my sister has never been attracted to him?

352
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,940
得了  拉杰
Come on   Raj

353
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,450
我怎么知道你妹妹
how am I supposed to know

354
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,680
现在喜欢谁  以前喜欢过谁
who she is attracted to or was attracted to

355
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,320
将来又会喜欢上谁啊
or who she might be attracted to in the future?

356
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,960
我对这个话题
And I have nothing to contribute

357
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,830
毫无建设性意见
to this conversation.

358
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,830
因为我也完全不知道
Because I   too   know absolutely nothing

359
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,900
普丽娅对男性伴侣的偏好
about Priya's preferences in male companionship.

360
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,400
所以  我会再次闭上嘴
And with that   I will re-zip my lip.

361
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,610
对了  你们觉得昨晚
Hey   so what did you guys think

362
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,640
卡布里卡的最新一集怎么样
of the new episode of Caprica last night?

363
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,610
我没看
I didn't see it.

364
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,540
啥  没看
Didn't see it?

365
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,140
那你在干什么
What were you doing?

366
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,080
我出去了
Uh   I was out.

367
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,880
啥  昨天可是卡布里卡之夜
What   on Caprica night?

368
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,190
是啊  我出去喝了一杯
Yeah   I   uh   went for a drink.

369
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,420
真的假的  就你
Really   you?

370
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,190
你去哪儿了
Where   w-where'd you go?

371
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,430
去了...
To   uh...

372
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,370
幸运鲍德温酒吧
Lucky Baldwin's.

373
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,270
我听说过那地方
Oh   I've heard of that place.

374
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,010
那不是帕萨迪纳最受欢迎的爱尔兰酒吧么
Isn't that Pasadena's favorite Irish watering hole?

375
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,780
没错
Yes.

376
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,080
你有没有在那里
Did you meet

377
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,350
遇到谈得来的人
anyone interesting there

378
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,580
是不是个滥交的红发调酒师
perhaps a promiscuous   redheaded barmaid?

379
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,590
说实话  我不行了
As a matter of fact... I-I-I-I-I can't   I can't

380
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,020
我做不到
I can't do it.

381
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,590
你当然可以  你做得很好  相当令人信服
Sure you can   you're doing fine   it's very believable.

382
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,060
我很抱歉  拉杰  但事实上
I'm sorry   Raj   but the truth is

383
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,930
昨晚我和普丽娅在一起
I was with Priya last night.

384
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,130
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

385
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,900
他还满脑子爱尔兰威士忌和熏蛋
He's still light-headed from all the Irish whiskey

386
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,770
一团浆糊呢
and pickled eggs in his system.

387
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,700
你和普丽娅在一起做什么
What were you doing with Priya?

388
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,740
我确信他们是在性交
I believe they engaged in coitus

389
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,540
但更重要的是
but more importantly

390
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,310
如果莱纳德没有半途而废
if Leonard had not abandoned his story

391
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,740
你觉得那个故事可信么
would you have found it plausible?

392
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,280
你上了我妹妹
You slept with my sister?!

393
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,210
对
Yeah.

394
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,450
你怎么可以这样  我们约定好的
How could you? We had a pact.

395
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,250
不好意思  我认为"你情何以堪  她可是我妹妹"
Excuse me   I think "How could you? She's my sister"

396
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,450
总比小孩子的勾勾手约定重要吧
takes precedence over a five-year-old pinky swear.

397
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,890
请允许我指出
May I point out

398
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,120
要是在平行世界  你的朋友会说
in a parallel universe   your friends are saying

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,760
"麦琪·麦凯瑞  这名字听起来真可爱"
"Maggie McGarry-- she sounds lovely."

400
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,230
听着  我承认  我是越线了
Look   I-I admit it   I may have crossed a line here

401
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,800
但是拉杰  得了  你妹妹都成年了
but come on   Raj   your sister is a grown woman

402
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,700
对她来说  我不过是块禁忌的白巧克力罢了
and to her   I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

403
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,800
真是难以置信
I don't believe it.

404
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,210
这是对我信任莫大的背叛
This is a terrible betrayal of my trust.

405
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,870
要是我告诉你  我向她献出真心
No   w-w-would it help if I told you

406
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,810
却被她狠狠践踏  你会好受点么
that I offered her my heart   and she kind of stomped on it?

407
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,580
她践踏得多狠
How hard did she stomp?

408
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
相当狠
Very hard.

409
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,920
好吧  好受多了
Okay   I'm good.

410
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,960
那个  拉杰
Well   Raj

411
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,360
我只是想说  我绝不会背叛你
I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust.

412
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,930
不会像莱纳德那样  我尊重你
Unlike Leonard   I respect you.

413
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,930
真的么
Really?

414
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,600
当然
Mm-hmm.

415
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,730
你瞒着拉杰  你把他的iPhone
Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj

416
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,370
掉进了便池  这算哪门子尊重
about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?

417
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,510
神马  我还把那玩意贴我脸上呢
Dude   I put that thing on my face!

418
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,380
我觉得对拉杰最有趣的欺骗
I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust

419
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,010
是霍华德居然让他相信
is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents

420
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,950
感恩节外国人要送美国人礼物
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

421
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,350
喂  我也没看到你
Hey   I didn't see you giving back

422
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,190
把他送你的史努比刨冰机还给他啊
your Snoopy snow cone maker.

423
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,320
那都是骗我的吗
That was all a lie?

424
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,460
今年的礼物我都准备好了
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

425
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,190
既然我们谈到背叛朋友的事
And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends

426
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,660
何不说说谢尔顿曾经整个月都
how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects

427
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,400
把虫子磨碎再混进莱纳德的食物里
and mixing them into Leonard's food?

428
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,770
不好意思
Well   excuse me.

429
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,370
那又不算背叛
That was not a betrayal.

430
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,500
这只是个实验  用来证明
That was an experiment to determine

431
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,710
什么浓度会使食物尝起来有"蛀虫"感
at what concentration food starts tasting "mothy."

432
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,880
你在我食物里放虫子
You put moths in my food?!

433
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,750
为了科学而献身
For science.

434
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,220
你居然用吃过虫子的嘴吻我妹妹
I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.

435
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,390
你还用了谢尔顿的牙刷呢
Well   I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.

436
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,690
你用了我的牙刷
You used my toothbrush?

437
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,590
没用刷毛的部分  不过是用那橡皮垫
Not the brush part   just the little rubber thing

438
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,430
剔了剔我的牙  顺便揉了揉牙床
to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.

439
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,110
好吧  我想我可以说
Okay   I-I think it's safe to say

440
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,610
我们都做过一些
that we've all done some things

441
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,380
不那么光彩的事
we're not particularly proud of.

442
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,540
但是算了  我们是朋友
But come on   we're friends.

443
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,520
朋友会互相谅解彼此的小错误
Friends overlook each other's minor lapses.

444
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
所以  霍华德  我很抱歉背叛了我们的约定
For the record   Howard   I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

445
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,860
多谢
Thank you.

446
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,690
我很抱歉把你的iPhone掉进了便池
And I'm sorry about your phone

447
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,490
还有感恩节的事
and Thanksgiving.

448
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,860
既然说到这个
And while we're at it

449
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,300
其实国庆节你也不用替我们洗衣服
you don't have to wash our clothes on the Fourth of July.

450
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,870
既然你们都道歉了
As long as we're apologizing

451
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,100
谢尔顿  很抱歉我用了你的牙刷
Sheldon   I'm   I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

452
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,340
我也很抱歉...
And I'm sorry...

453
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,840
那这种行为让人忍无可忍
but that behavior is beyond the pale

454
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,510
不可原谅
and cannot be tolerated.

455
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,640
我们不再是朋友了
We are no longer friends.

456
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,680
感恩节我送你个托马斯蒸汽火车头
I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

457
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,650
会喷真的烟吗
With real puffing smoke?

458
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,890
会
Yes.

459
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,220
好吧
All right.

460
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,230
但我记住你了
But I'm watching you.

461
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,740
哎呀  你把史努比拿出来了
Hey   you've got Snoopy out.

462
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,940
我能来一杯刨冰么
Can I have a snow cone?

463
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,810
当然
Well   sure.

464
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
味道不错
This is pretty good.

465
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,020
这是什么味道
What flavor is this?

466
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,920
猜猜
Guess.

467
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,520
-木瓜吗  -不是
- Papaya? - No.

468
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,160
-石榴呢  -接近了
- Guava? - You're so close.

469
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
我放弃  是什么
I give up.

470
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,560
芒果毛毛虫
Mango caterpillar.

471
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,730
你这是干什么
What are you doing?!

472
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,700
你说你喜欢的呀
You said you liked it.
