1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,780
你们准备点菜了吗
Hey. So you guys ready to order?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,770
既然我们每个周二晚上6点都来
Since we come in every Tuesday night at 6:00

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,500
点完全一样的菜  现在是6:08分了
and order the same exact thing, and it's now 6:08

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,930
我想  不言而喻的不仅是这个问题
I believe your question not only answers itself

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,390
还有其他一些愚蠢的问题
but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,580
比如  "谁把狗放出来了"
as "Who let the dogs out?"

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,580
还有"他们过得如何"
And, uh, "How are they hanging""

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,160
好吧
Okay.

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,490
惯例  谢尔顿的汉堡上加一口唾沫
So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.

10

佩妮  等等
Penny, a moment?

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,290
这周末你有安排吗
Do you have plans this weekend?

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,380
天啊  艾米  很抱歉
Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,900
我这周末真的很忙
I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,350
可能要上今天点的菜
Probably serving food that was ordered today.

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,790
真不幸  我还想让你当我的伴儿
That's too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one

19
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,400

The what?

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,410
是一个年度科学会议
It's an annual science conference.

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,730
我们都被邀请发言
We've all been invited to speak.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,310
哦  好吧  正如我说的  我有安排了
Oh! Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so...

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,980
真可惜  因为你是我最好的朋友
Shame. Since you're my best friend

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,190
我还以为这是个增加交流的机会呢
I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,940
我是你最好的朋友吗
I'm your best friend?

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,370
你不看我的博客吗
Don't you read my blog?

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,270
别难过
Oh, don't feel bad.

28
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,790
我从来不看莱纳德的  我以前还跟他睡过
I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,910
你认识其他会想去
Do you know anybody else who would appreciate

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,560
费用全包的大苏四星酒店
an all-expense-paid spa weekend

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,100
spa周末游的人吗
at a four-star resort in Big Sur?

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,390
不  我真的  对不起  免费什么  对不起  什么  什么
No, I really-- I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,170
我想她周末突然没事了
I think her weekend just opened up.

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,150
等等  等等  我确认一下  你们说的spa
Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say "Spa  "

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,040
跟普通人说的spa是一样的吗
does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?

36
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,630
差不多
Pretty much.

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,890
除了我们穿着衣服蒸桑拿
Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,460
你知道吗  尽管会很难
You know, it is going to be difficult

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,090
但是我要取消我的安排  为了我的好朋友
but I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,750
请不要碰我的胸
Please don't touch my breasts.

41
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,240
我  我没想
I... I wasn't going to.

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,710
好吧  我只是要确定一下界限
All right. I just want to establish boundaries.

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,440
伙计们  这太棒了  我好久没度假了
Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,730
想度假  先工作
In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,910
知道吗  作为一个聪明人
You know, for a smart guy

46
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,290
你竟然不明白一个原则
you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept

47
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,060
"不要惹给你准备饭的人"
"Don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat."

48
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,940
这原则确实很对
That does seem to be a valid principle.

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,770
我相信佩妮会遵守
I trust Penny will adhere to

50
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,840

51

道德和清洁庄严誓约"
Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness."

52
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,630
我认为没有这种东西
I don't believe there's any such thing.

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,620
你骗我
You lied to me?

54
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,550
生活大爆炸第四季第十三集

55
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,370

在半小时之内完成介绍

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,320
你可以抄我的

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,100
拉杰

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,310
你在干吗
What are you doing?

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,550
那可不行
I don't think so.

67
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,860
你的6盎司定额已经喝完了
You've had your allotted six ounces.

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,430
第一个上厕所时间是在贝克斯菲尔德的
The first bathroom break isn't until the Denny's

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,480
丹尼餐厅

70
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,330
距此大约2个半小时
which is approximately two and half hours away.

71
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,980
记住  同志们

72
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,370
我们的强硬受制于最弱的膀胱

艾米·费拉·福勒

好吧  红5号呼叫红1号
Fine. Red Five to Red Leader.

95
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,070
紧跟在你们后面呢

96
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,550
收到  红5号
Copy that, Red Five.

97
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,660
无线电联络就足够了
Radio contact is sufficient.

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,770
不需要伸你的中指
No need to extend your middle finger.

99
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,550
艾米  我在想
So, Amy, I've been wondering

100
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,550
你和谢尔顿要共住一间房吗
are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?

101
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,480
不  我们讨论过了
No, we discussed it.

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,740
一致认为  我们不想因为太了解对方
We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,680
而损害了我们的关系
by getting to know each other too well.

104
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,000
确实  没有比熟知对方的如厕规律
Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,410
更破坏友情的事了
than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.

106
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,700
我深表赞同
I can vouch for that.

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
-喂  -不是说你  说他
- Hey. - Not you, him.

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,300
哦  谢谢
Oh. Thanks.

109
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,510
不过  你的可真让人开眼了
Although yours was an eye-opener.

110
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,730
别担心  佩妮
Don't worry, Penny.

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,140
你是我带的伴儿  你跟我住
You're my plus-one. You'll bunk with me.

112
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,800
另外  旅行会让我便秘
And FYI, travel makes me constipated

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,990
所以  我是理想的酒店住宿室友
so I'm the ideal hotel roommate.

114
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,400
好极了
Terriffic.

115
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,840
还没到吗
Are we there yet?

116
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,540
我希望我们能赶得上主题致辞
I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,810
真的吗  你想看主题致辞
Really? You want to see the keynote?

118
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,600
对  听起来很有意思
Yeah, it sounds fun.

119
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,860
"超级细菌
"Super bacteria:

120
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,390
末日启示  还是令人激动的研究机会"
global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"

121
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,960
事实上  我想得是  我们直接去房间
Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,140
然后  "休整"一下
and... take a nap.

123
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,740
真的吗
Really?

124
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,180
不去看主题致辞了
And miss the keynote?

125
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,560
回头能在C-SPAN上看到的
We can watch it later on C-SPAN.

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,480
而且  我真的很期待  你和我
Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me...

127
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,340
一起在酒店里"休整"
napping together in the hotel.

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,210
亲爱的  你那么困的话
Honey, if you're that tired

129
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,380
就在车里先睡上一觉吧
why don't you just take a nap here in the car?

130
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,290
不  你看  不是
No, see, it's not...

131
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,430
等一下  莱纳德来电话
Hang on. It's Leonard.

132
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,350
嗨  莱纳德
Hi, Leonard.

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,830
嗨  我刚收到拉杰的短信
Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj.

134
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,680
他让我告诉你
He wanted me to tell you

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,230
霍华德说的"休整"  是"做爱"的意思
that when Howard says "Nap  " He means "Sex."

136
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,460
谢谢你  拉杰
Thank you, Raj.

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,730
你是錒系元素的一种吗
Are you... an element in the actinoid series?

138
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,670
不是
No.

139
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,830
艾米
Amy?

140
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,340
你在自然界中是放射性的吗
Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?

141
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,190
不是
No.

142
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,620
你是镧系元素吗
Are you in the lanthanoid series?

143
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,840
艾米  轮到佩妮了
Amy, it's Penny's turn.

144
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,600
佩妮
Penny?

145
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,250
呃  我咋知道
Uh, I don't know...

146
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,540
你是吃的吗
Are you food?

147
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,120
这就是你不对了
That's not apropos.

148
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,360
不是说明白了吗  在元素周期表里[直译:桌]
We've already established I'm found in the periodic table.

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
好歹是张桌  不是吗
Well, it's a table, right?

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,470
是桌子干嘛不能放吃的
I mean, why can't there be food on it?

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,340
就知道她不配坐领头车
I knew she wasn't lead car materiel.

152
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,950
谁选你当了汽车旅行之王了
Who elected you Road Trip God?

153
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,470
莱纳德
Leonard.

154
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,670
那是深夜投票
It was a late-night vote.

155
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,250
大家都精疲力尽了
We were all exhausted

156
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,440
他威胁我们不选他就不让睡
and he was threatening to filibuster.

157
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,430
也不是啥"汽车旅行之王"啦
It's not technically "Road Trip God""

158
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,360
是旅途监督员
it's Travel Supervisor.

159
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,700
尽管汽车旅行之王听着更拉风一些
Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.

160
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,730
我就不明白了  你们怎么就
I don't understand why you people

161
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,190
让他这么欺负你们啊
just let him bully you like this.

162
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,570
该有人奋起反抗
Someone should stand up to him.

163
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,850
他能怎么着
What's he going to do?

164
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,980
真不敢相信  你们就眼看着他把我轰出来
I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.

165
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,260
我们敢怎样啊  他是旅程监督人
What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.

166
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,250
别担心  佩妮  反正这辆车更赞
Don't worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.

167
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,400
没错  这是爱爱车喔
Yeah. It's the Love Car.

168
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,850
还用问么
Should I ask?

169
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,420
*他们说我们太小还不懂得*
*They say we're young and we don't know*

170
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,230
*长大后才能领悟*
*We won't find out until we grow*

171
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,800
*我不知这正确与否*
*Well, I don't know if all that's true*

172
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,920
*因为宝贝  我们拥有彼此*
*'Cause you got me, and, baby, I got you*

173
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,530
*宝贝*
*Babe*

174
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,180
*我拥有你*
*I got you, babe*

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,160
红一号  我真的错了
Red Leader, I'm really sorry.

176
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,100
*我拥有你  宝贝*
*I got you, babe.*

177
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,100
*我拥有你  宝贝*
*I got you, babe...*

178
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,690
我想你了
I missed you.

179
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,070
知道不  我也无比想你
You know what? I missed you, too.

180
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,030
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?

181
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,500
天呐  格伦
Oh, my God, Glenn!

182
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,450
见到你真高兴
Great to see you!

183
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,880
你是来参加研讨会的吗
Are you here for the conference?

184
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,670
是啊  我在全球暖化座谈组
Yeah, I'm doing a global warming panel.

185
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,890
真不错
Oh, good for you.

186
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,250
格伦  这是霍华德  我男朋友
Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.

187
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,310
-很高兴认识你  -嗨
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.

188
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,130
哎哟  嗨
Ow. Hi.

189
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,510
你很幸运嘛
You're a lucky man.

190
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,280
妮妮是个好姑娘
Bernie's a great gal.

191
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,160
是啊  "妮妮"确实很好
Yes. "Bernie" Sure is.

192
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,540
我先走一步  座谈会定在明早
Well, I got to run. The panel's tomorrow morning.

193
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,230
主题是"忆雪: 回首往昔"
It's called, "Remembering Snow: A Look Back."

194
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,260
我会尽量去的
I'll try to catch it.

195
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,960
太好了
Oh, great.

196
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,030
-拜拜  -拜
- Bye. - Bye.

197
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,220
那个...妮妮
Hey... Bernie?

198
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,260
咋了
Yeah?

199
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,100
拜托告诉我那是你同性恋的表亲
Please tell me he's your gay cousin.

200
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,430
不是啊  他是我大学教授
No. He was one of my professors in college.

201
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,880
这样啊  算是松了口气
Oh! That's a relief.

202
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,020
然后我们交往过一年
Then we went out for a year.

203
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,020
来吧  赶紧办理入住  就能去"休整"一下啦
Come on, let's check in, so we can take that nap.

204
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,710
不  不一定是成比例的...
No, it's not necessarily proportional...

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,690
闭嘴
Shut up!

206
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,090
那个绿包是库珀博士的
That green bag is Dr. Cooper's.

207
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,280
多给你五美刀  拜托让他多等会
Here's an extra five. Make him wait.

208
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,050
直接进入"休整"了呀  好吧
Right to the nap, huh? Okay?

209
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,530
那个  格伦那哥们
Uh, so, this Glenn guy.

210
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,090
你说你们交往了一年呐
You say you went out with him for, like, a year.

211
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,660
咱有必要这时候讨论我的前男友吗
Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?

212
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,880
不  大概没必要吧
No. I guess not.

213
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,600
他多高啊  1.93还是1.95
What is he, like, six-four, six-five?

214
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,500
两米啦
Six-seven.

215
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,860
估计不好买衣服吧
Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.

216
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,950
你有什么不爽吗
Is something bothering you?

217
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,110
-没  就是  -就是什么
- No. It's just... - What?

218
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,970
我就是想吧
I'm just thinking.

219
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,440
如果你和那哥们儿上过床
If you had sex with that guy

220
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,860
我是说  我现在也不能变得
I mean, there's nothing I can do here

221
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,770
更..."给力"一点
that will make any kind of... impact.

222
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,470
霍华德  这又不是什么比赛
Howard, it's not a contest.

223
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,100
我爱你  我想和你在一起
I love you. I want to be with you.

224
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,270
那很好啊  我也爱你  但
Yeah, great, love you, too, but...

225
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,740
如果是个比赛
If it were a contest

226
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,000
我也没机会赢啊  对吧
I wouldn't have a chance, right?

227
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,850
你不能这么想
You can't think that way.

228
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,630
对
Yep.

229
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,680
萎男
Loser.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,150
霍华德  别这样
Howard, stop it.

231
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,870
对不起  我就是没想到
Sorry. I just never figured that

232
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,940
我这种人跟你这种女孩交往
a guy like me going out with a girl like you

233
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,820
还要跟他那种男人竞争
would ever have to compete with a guy like that.

234
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,440
等等  什么叫"我这种女孩"
Wait a minute, "A girl like me"? What's that mean?

235
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,650
我...我那个
I'm... I...

236
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,280
你是说我没那么辣
Are you saying you don't think I'm hot enough

237
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,910
配不上格伦吗
to go out with a guy like Glenn?

238
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,760
不  不是啊  完全跟你那意思相反
No! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.

239
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,740
我太辣了  格伦配不上我吗
I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?

240
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,160
对啊  那就这意思吧
Yeah, let's go with that.

241
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,470
还是没货
Still nothing.

242
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,430
一小时后提醒我再试一次
Remind me to try again in an hour.

243
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,440
包在我身上
Will do.

244
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,170
那么
So...

245
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,160
闺蜜谈心
girl talk?

246
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,620
好啊
Um, sure.

247
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,230
你想聊啥
What do you got in mind?

248
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,460
你同意弗洛依德的"阴茎嫉妒"理论吗
Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?

249
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,770
呃  我还真没想过
Um, I never really thought about it.

250
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,330
怎么了
Why?

251
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,620
有时候我觉得长一根挺不错的
Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.

252
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,180
真的吗
Really?

253
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,600
不为嘿咻  为了方便
Not for sex, for convenience.

254
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,950
你不能否认  比较而言
You can't deny that, by comparison

255
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,940
我们的内部下水系统太难伺候了
our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.

256
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,080
我也没怎么想过这个
Again, I've never given it much thought.

257
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,040
现在有时间啊
We have time now.

258
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,050
想想吧
Think about it.

259
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,700
太好了
Oh, good.

260
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,830
嗨
Hey.

261
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,860
我今晚能住这吗
Can I stay here tonight?

262
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,700
好啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why, what happened?

263
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,220
霍华德是个超级无敌大混蛋
Howard's a complete and total ass.

264
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,630
啊  我懂的  来吧
Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.

265
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,360
谢啦  我睡地板就好
Thanks. I'll sleep on the floor.

266
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,320
不用的
Not necessary.

267
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,730
我跟佩妮完全不介意睡一张床
Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.

268
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,140
不介意吗
We are?

269
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,330
当然了  我们是闺蜜嘛
Of course, we're best friends.

270
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,490
哦对了  博客写了
Oh, right, right, the blog.

271
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,510
不过  温馨提示
Word of warning, though.

272
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,160
我有夜惊倾向
I'm prone to night terrors

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,370
所以如果我睁眼乱踢或尖叫  别慌
so when I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic.

274
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,050
把我按倒抚摸我的头发  就会没事的
Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.

275
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,350
-嗨  我今晚能住这吗  -嘘嘘嘘
- Hey, can I stay here tonight? - Shh-shh-shh.

276
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,790
谢尔顿睡着了
Sheldon's asleep.

277
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,660
啥情况
What's going on?

278
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,640
这个  霍华德是个超级无敌大混蛋
Well, Howard's a complete and total ass

279
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,750
所以伯纳黛特占了我的床
Bernadette's in my bed

280
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,930
不管我怎么摸艾米的头发  她都乱咬
and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.

281
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,070
-啥  -无所谓了
- What? - Never mind.

282
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,050
我能住这儿不
Can I stay here or not?

283
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,310
-当然能  -太好了
- Uh, sure. - All right.

284
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,350
你想怎么睡
So, how do you want to do this?

285
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,700
反正打死我也不跟他睡
Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.

286
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,750
没错  就像是
Yeah, it is a little like

287
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,670
爬进了德拉库拉的棺材
getting into Dracula's coffin.
著名吸血鬼电影角色

288
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,690
我们得充分利用这个情况
We're just gonna have to make the best of this.

289
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
好吧  你说"充分利用"的意思是
Okay, when you say "make the best of it..."

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
-睡觉  -好吧
- Sleep.  - Right.

291
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,120
我们就把中间这里叫做
So we'll just call the middle here

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,790
"中立区"
the Neutral Zone.

293
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,040
中什么
The what?

294
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,610
《星际迷航》啊
Star Trek.

295
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,770
中立区嘛
You know, the Neutral Zone

296
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,200
就在联邦和罗慕兰帝国之间
between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.

297
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,430
哦  好吧
Oh, okay.

298
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,490
就跟当年一样
Just like old times.

299
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,790
当然咯
Of course

300
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,890
有时候联邦和罗慕兰帝国
sometimes the Federation and the Romulans

301
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,360
会进入中立区
would enter the Neutral Zone

302
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,860
进行临时休战谈判
to negotiate a temporary truce.

303
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,580
亲爱的  我就敞开天窗说亮话吧
Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand:

304
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,500
休想碰我的下半身
from the waist down, my shields are up.

305
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,560
懂了  懂了
Got it, got it.

306
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,450
知道吗  只用上半身
We can do all kinds of stuff

307
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,130
我们也可以玩出很多花样
from the waist up, you know?

308
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,170
-睡觉  -晚安
- Go to sleep.  - Good night.

309
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,830
请亲口告诉我你俩没在交媾
Please tell me you're not having coitus.

310
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,070
我俩没在交媾
We are not having coitus.

311
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,670
你俩能保证今晚一直
Can you guarantee that it won't happen

312
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,160
都不交媾吗
at any time during the night?

313
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,210
-能  -不能
- Yes.  - No.

314
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,700
特纳经典电影频道即将播出
Next on Turner Classic Movies

315
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,200
《BJ单身日记》
Bridget Jones's Diary.

316
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,960
哦天呐  我已经内牛满面了
Oh, my God, I'm crying already.

317
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,210
拉杰  拉杰
Raj? Raj?

318
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
拉杰
Raj?

319
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,120
我今晚得睡在这儿
I need to sleep here tonight.

320
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,420
为啥
Why?

321
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,180
霍华德是个彻头彻尾的大混蛋
Howard is a complete and total ass

322
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,540
伯纳黛特霸占了佩妮的床  艾米总咬人
Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites

323
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,470
佩妮和莱纳德有可能会交媾
and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.

324
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,220
好吧  进来吧
Okay. Come on in.

325
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
莱纳德  你睡着了吗
Leonard, are you asleep?

326
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,760
没
No.

327
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,340
真的很感谢你今晚收留我
I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.

328
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,660
小意思  没什么
Sure, no problem.

329
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,530
我知道这样有点儿尴尬
I know it's kinda weird.

330
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,660
米错
True dat.

331
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,460
"米错"
"True dat"?

332
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,990
自从咱俩分手以后我学会了更多流行语
I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.

333
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,310
好吧
Right.

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,100
还生我气吗
Still mad at me about that?

335
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,310
不了不了  我很理解
No. No, I understand.

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,900
我逼得太紧  你想要些空间
I got too intense, you had to back off.

337
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,830
谢谢
Thank you.

338
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,710
这方面我现在已经好多了  知道吗
I've gotten a lot better at that, you know.

339
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,330
我俩分手以后我跟四个女人约会过
I've dated four different women since we broke up

340
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,610
我没跟她们中任何一个人说过"我爱你"
and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them

341
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,820
和"我想和你生儿育女"
and wanted to have their babies.

342
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,690
真替你高兴
Good for you.

343
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,100
嗯  晚安
Okay, good night.

344
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,230
晚安
Good night.

345
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,960
知道吗  也许今晚突破一下中立区
You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world

346
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,400
也不是什么坏主意
to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night.

347
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,710
嗨  莱纳德  谢尔顿把我赶出了
Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me

348
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,650
房间  把你房间的钥匙给我了
out of the room, gave me your key.

349
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,110
佩妮在这儿呢
Penny's here.

350
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,920
不啊  我们不想看《BJ单身日记》
No, we don't want to watch Bridget Jones's Diary!

351
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,940
早上好  欢迎参加"科学与社会"研讨会
Good morning and welcome to Science and Society.

352
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,410
我是谢尔顿·库珀
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper

353
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,610
理学学士兼理学硕士兼文学硕士
BS, MS, MA

354
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,770
兼哲学博士兼理学博士
PhD, and ScD.

355
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,290
我的神呐  是吧
OMG, right?

356
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,550
也许这个笑话对于在座各位有点儿太弱智了
Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd.

357
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,900
好了  我们开始致开幕词
All right then, we'll begin with opening remarks.

358
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,340
罗斯顿考斯基小姐  你愿意抛砖引玉
Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off

359
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,180
谈谈你对于
by discussing your assessment

360
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,070
科学对社会的责任的看法吗
of science's responsibility to society?

361
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,000
好的
Sure.

362
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,290
我认为  每一个自然学科
I think all branches of science

363
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,240
在今天都需要谨慎发展
have to move cautiously these days.

364
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,530
能毁灭世界的
It's not just giant nuclear weapons

365
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,100
并不只有大型的核武器
that can destroy the world.

366
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,940
作为一名微生物学家  我可以告诉你
As a microbiologist, I can tell you

367
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,280
即使是最微小的微生物也能让你尸骨无存
even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.

368
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,960
有意思
Interesting.

369
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,640
我觉得在座各位需要了解我同事的一点
I think what you might need to know about my colleague

370
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,780
就是尽管她声称
is that though she claims

371
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,010
她最感兴趣的领域是细小的微生物
her field of interest is tiny organisms

372
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,990
她显然在我们可以认为是大型武器的东西上
she certainly has spent her fair share of time

373
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,120
花了相当多的时间
around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.

374
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,680
我认为沃罗威茨先生需要记住一点
I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,700
那就是过去的事情已经过去了
that the past is the past.

376
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,060
但他应该知道我是那种
But he should know that I am the kind of girl

377
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,640
让任何"大型导弹"趋之若鹜的女孩
who could get all the giant missiles she wants.

378
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,780
我们在讨论女性对阴茎的渴求吗
Are we talking about women wanting penises?

379
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,520
因为我想插一句嘴
Because I'd like to weigh in.

380
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,630
库萨帕里博士  你想说几句吗
Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?

381
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,060
当然  我有两点要讲
Certainly. I'd like to raise two points.

382
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,790
第一  我觉得他们确实在讨论小弟弟
Number one, I think they are talking about penises.

383
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,960
第二  这桔汁他妈的香槟太他妈的爽了
And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.

384
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,140
我真他妈的想他妈的踹你
I'd like to kick your little brown ass.

385
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,220
我干啥了
What did I do?

386
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,670
我不知道诶
Oh, I don't know.

387
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,430
也许当你走进一间酒店房间
Maybe when you walk into a hotel room

388
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,680
看见一哥们儿跟女朋友重归于好时
and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend

389
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,830
你应该考虑做点儿别的什么
you should consider doing something other

390
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,460
而不是爬到旁边的床上
than crawling into the adjoining bed.

391
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,540
是啊  你说了不能看《BJ单身日记》的
I did. You said no Bridget Jones.

392
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,470
我俩没有重归于好
We weren't getting back together!

393
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,340
只是一夜风流而已
It was a one-time thing!

394
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,180
对不起
Excuse me.

395
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,020
我们现在不接受
We're not taking comments or questions

396
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,910
观众的评论和提问
from the audience just yet.

397
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,700
闭嘴吧  谢尔顿
Oh, shut up, Sheldon!

398
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,840
-嗨  闺蜜  -嗨
- Hi, bestie.  - Hi.

399
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,500
好吧  我们为什么不试着重回正题呢
All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.

400
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,120
让我来问问你吧  妮妮
Let me ask you something, Bernie.

401
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,460
看样子不行
I guess not.

402
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
如果你碰到了我酷似安吉丽娜·朱莉的
How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend

403
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,460
前女友  你会作何感受
and she was like Angelina Jolie?

404
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,110
拜托  霍华德  别做梦了
Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.

405
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,260
怎么  如此英俊的我难道钓不到安吉丽娜·朱莉吗
What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?

406
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,160
我想插句嘴
I'd like to weigh in here.

407
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,330
确实钓不到
No.

408
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,410
好吧  我们不如开始进入
All right, why don't we open it up

409
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,830
观众的问答环节吧
to Q&A from the audience?

410
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,750
好  我有问题
Yeah, I have a question.

411
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,560
有谁今晚能带我离开这鬼地方
Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here

412
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,540
回洛杉矶
and back to Los Angeles tonight?

413
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,410
我今晚开车回洛城
I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.

414
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,360
佩妮  那是格伦  格伦  那是佩妮
Penny, that's Glenn. Glenn, that's Penny.

415
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,420
不要
No!

416
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,290
红1号呼叫红5号
Red Leader to Red Five.

417
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,310
红1号呼叫红5号
Red Leader to Red Five.

418
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,920
谁想玩个小游戏
Anybody up for a little game?

419
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,770
我心里想的是
I spy with my little eye...

420
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,420
一种非铁金属
a nonferrous metal.

421
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,760
估计是超出接收范围了
Must be out of range.

422
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,410
莱纳德  我能问你个问题吗
Leonard, can I ask you a question?

423
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,460
问吧
Sure.

424
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,630
你这么生气是不是因为你的前任女友
Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend

425
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,140
和一位可能是我这辈子见过的
left the symposium with what is probably

426
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,620
最帅的男人一起离开研讨会了
the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?

427
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,230
不是  你为啥这么问
No. Why do you ask?

428
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,580
因为我们的时速达到了120英里[约193公里]
Because we're going 120 miles per hour.

429
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,850
好吧  如果没人想猜的话
All right, if no one's going to guess...

430
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,550
其实我想的是几英里前我们经过的
I was spying the aluminum rims on the police car

431
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,520
那辆警车的铝制轮缘
we passed a few miles back.
