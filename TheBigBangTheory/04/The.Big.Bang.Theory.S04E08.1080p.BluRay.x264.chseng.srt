1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
谁给我解释一下
Okay, help me out here.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,170
一位考古学教授怎么会把鞭子玩得那么溜
How does an archeology professor get that good with a whip?

3
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,670
估计是在成人书店学的吧[暗指SM]
Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,340
反正我是这么学的
That's how I learned.

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,150
真不敢相信你居然没看过《法柜奇兵》
I can't believe you've never seen  Raiders of the Lost Ark.
经典动作大片《夺宝奇兵》系列的第一部

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,920
我也不敢相信你居然没看过《饭·祷·爱》
And I can't believe you've never read  Eat, Pray, Love.
《美食·祈祷·恋爱》亦作《一辈子做女孩》

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,550
要是写一本
When she comes out with

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,150
《吃饭·祈祷·躲避大滚石》  我就看
Eat, Pray, Run Away From A   Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,020
我才不管《饭·祷·爱》对你的人生有多大影响呢
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life,

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,230
我才不看呢
I'm not reading it.

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,260
知道吗  我也能那么转帽子
You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,030
那可是著名的好莱坞服装设计师德博拉·纳杜曼的
That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,100
杰作
Deborah Nadoolman.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,440
她还设计了
She also designed

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
迈克尔·杰克逊的《战栗》的MV中
the iconic red and black jacket

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
那件经典的红黑夹克
in Michael Jackson's Thriller video,

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
不过我一直没看完MV
which I've never viewed in its entirety,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,080
因为我觉得一群僵尸
as I find zombies dancing

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,480
跳舞这么整齐实在是太假了
in choreographed synchronicity implausible.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,920
而且  真的好吓人啊
And also, it's really scary.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,020
麻烦哪位帮忙把谢尔顿评论音轨给关掉吧
Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,760
不好意思没有开关  你就好好听着
There's no switch. Just listen and learn.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,320
佩妮  如果你觉得这片子不错的话
Penny, if you think this is good,

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,790
你可以周五和我们一起
you should come with us Friday

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,660
在科洛尼奥电影院的大屏幕上再看一遍
to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.
位于宾州凤凰镇  是电影《斑点》的拍摄地和纪念地

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,960
我现在就在看啊
Well, I'm watching it now.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,430
干嘛还要周五再看一遍
Why would I want to see it again on Friday?

28
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,270
因为周五那场的胶片
Because the print they're showing on Friday

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,270
有首次公映的21秒加长镜头哦
has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,410
什么  21秒  那不就像是看一部全新的电影了吗
What? 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,440
没错
Exactly.

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,210
据说加长片段能解释关于潜艇的争论
They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,950
莱纳德
Did-- Leonard?

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,050
我不确定哈  但是我觉得
I'm no expert, but I believe

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,850
佩妮刚才那话是在讽刺咱们
what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,720
哇  又猜对了
Oh! Good.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,850
本月26中8了
I'm 8 for 26 this month.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
嗯  我还是算了吧
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,030
你们几位好好享受这21秒吧
But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,460
要是我能让你能明白
Bet if I could make you understand

41
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,730
这玩意儿有多酷的话  咱俩肯定还在一起
why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,230
嗯  没错  不  不可能了
Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
对
Uh-huh.

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,610
我猜佩妮这"21秒"跟"那个"也有关系
I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,870
生活大爆炸第四季第八集

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,360
请允许我指出
May I point out to you all

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,660
电影院的座位都是先到先得的
that the screening is "first come, first served"?

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,260
淡定  现在才5点  电影12点才开始
Relax, it's 5:00. The movie doesn't start till midnight.

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,630
但要是换种说法
Another way of saying that is

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,700
"电影12点开演  现在已经5点了"
"the movie starts at midnight, and it's already 5:00."

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,240
咱们出发吧
Let's go.

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,310
如果我们没赶上的话  我们下半辈子
You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,610
就能享受谢尔顿无休止的抱怨悔恨了
listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,440
看见没  霍华德也等不及了
See? Howard's on my side.

55
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,150
其实我不是那意思
Actually, I'm not.

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,120
我是用讽刺手法调戏你
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,990
靠  跌到27中8了
Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

58
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,020
别担心了  谢尔顿  我们能赶上的
Don't worry, Sheldon.We'll be fine.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,990
上次和我一起排了14小时队的
What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter

60
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,430
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德怎么了
who waited in line with me for 14 hours

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,630
去看《星际迷航:复仇女神》的午夜首映那次
to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,430
哦  他排了14个小时的队
Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours,

63
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,030
而你却在躺椅上睡大觉
while you napped in a lawn chair,

64
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,700
他在离队去尿尿的时候
he got in a fight with a Klingon

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,340
和一个克林贡人吵了起来
when he stepped out of line to pee

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,200
而你却不愿起来证明他没有插队
and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him,

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,570
最恶劣的是  他还看了《星际迷航:复仇女神》
and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

68
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,710
但我俩的座位如何
But how were our seats?

69
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,780
相当好
Excellent.

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,380
那不就结了
I rest my case.

71
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,820
艾米  你难道不觉得我们现在就该去排队吗
Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,490
其实作为你们这个社交团体的最新成员
Actually, as the newest member of your social group,

73
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,690
我觉得偶尔偏向你们的朋友们一方
I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily

74
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,990
更能让我融入你们
siding with your friends from time to time.

75
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,990
真阴险
Shrewd.

76
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,600
莱纳德  你说得对
Leonard, you're right.

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
我们就应该好好享受完美食再过去
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late,

78
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,270
冒着最后坐上超烂座位的风险
and risk winding up with terrible seats,

79
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,330
当然  前提是我们都能进得去
assuming we get in at all.

80
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,040
多谢了  艾米
Thank you, Amy.

81
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,640
看见了吧  很管用的
See? It's working.

82
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,610
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

83
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,740
谁呀
Who's there?

84
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
橄榄[我爱你]
Olive.[I love u]

85
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,710
我也爱你
Olive you, too.

86
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,050
二位  这有点儿太俗了吧
Guys, that's really starting to get old.

87
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,180
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

88
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,290
谁啊
Who's there?

89
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,120
哥有马子你干瞪眼
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

90
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,190
哈哈哈
Hysterical!

91
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,430
等等  我还不知道呢  他还没说完
Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished.

92
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,230
哥有马子你干瞪眼姓什么
I have a girlfriend and you don't who?

93
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,430
你真的不想和我们一起去看《夺宝奇兵》吗
So. Are you sure you don't want to come with us to Raiders?

94
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,440
不去了  那部片子里有熔化的人脸
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,070
总是会让我想起
It reminds me too much of the time

96
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
我上次把一小瓶食肉细菌
I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria

97
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,340
掉在恒河猴实验室的情景
into the Rhesus monkey lab.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,380
而且佩妮和我今晚有个女生之夜
Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight.

99
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,550
女生之夜  什么意思
Girls' night?  What does that entail?

100
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,150
哦  闺蜜们聚在一起啊
Oh, you know, girls get together,

101
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,680
一起玩儿  分享闺房密语
hang out, share girl talk.

102
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,720
我也是女生
I'm a girl.

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,290
也许你也可以来  我问问佩妮吧
Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I'll ask Penny.

104
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,230
没必要  佩妮跟我可亲近了
No need. Penny and I are very close.

105
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,930
是吗
You are?

106
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,470
那是  事实上  我们的生理期都同步的
Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized.

107
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,540
佩妮
Penny.

108
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,470
伯纳黛特说你们今晚要搞女生之夜
Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.

109
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,410
我是女生
I'm a girl.

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,080
这只是  本来想着只有我和伯纳黛特的
Oh. Um, it was -- it was just going to be me and Bernadette.

111
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,950
再说  你不是跟谢尔顿
Besides, I thought you were going to the movies

112
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,020
还有那几个男人去看电影吗
with Sheldon and the guys.

113
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,390
是的  但是他们又不是女生
Yes, but they're not girls.

114
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,590
我是女生
I'm a girl.

115
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,660
不  对  对  我呃懂的
Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.

116
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,160
有什么着装要求
What's the dress code?

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,100
穿你觉得舒服的衣服就行
Uh, just wear something comfortable.

118
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,900
好的  我得去买几件才行了
All right. I'll have to go shopping.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,840
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

120
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,940
谁呀
Who is there?

121
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,540
-休  -休什么
- Hugh.  - Hugh who?

122
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,240
休·大家都得听我的
Hugh people need to listen to me.

123
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,850
该去排队看电影了
It's time to get in line for the movie.

124
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,280
你们这种敲门游戏就应该这么玩的
And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.

125
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,130
一般情况下  我会说"告诉过你们啦"
Under normal circumstances I'd say, "I told you so".

126
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,330
但是既然我已经无数次
But as I have told you so

127
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,860
愤怒地告诉过你们了
with such vehemence and frequency already,

128
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,930
所以现在这句话已经没有意义了
the phrase has lost all meaning.

129
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,570
因此  我要换种说法
Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase:

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,940
我已经如是告知过你们了
"I informed you thusly".

131
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,710
啊  那我真是等不及了
Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.

132
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,010
我已经如是告知过你们了
I informed you thusly.

133
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,510
28中8了
8 for 28.

134
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,410
我们要是没去吃晚饭的话
This is where we could have been

135
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,380
现在就应该站在这儿
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

136
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,550
要是库萨帕里没点甜品的话
This is where we could have been

137
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,920
我们现在就应该站在这儿
if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

138
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,990
那是我应得的老兄  我把西兰花都吃掉了
Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.

139
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,160
现在我们只能站在这儿  作为人海一粟
And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,830
永远也赶不上
Unlikely to ever reach

141
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,870
印第安纳·琼斯的精彩视觉盛宴了
the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

142
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,740
看来幸好我们吃了晚餐
So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.

143
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,710
伙计们  当面对沮丧时
You know, guys, when facing disappointment,

144
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,910
《饭·祷·爱》教导我们
Eat, Pray, Loveteaches us --

145
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,480
闭嘴吧
Oh, shut up.

146
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,250
总而言之  长话短说
...So anyway, to make a long story short,

147
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,820
结果我的子宫颈异常地紧
turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.

148
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,190
我说艾米啊  我们说要谈女生话题的时候
You know -- Amy, when we say "girl talk",

149
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,100
不一定是要谈论我们的女性部位的
it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.

150
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,980
真可惜  因为我有个很精彩的故事
Shame. 'Cause I have a real zinger

151
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,900
是关于我倾斜的子宫的
about my tilted uterus.

152
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,110
佩妮  你的指甲好漂亮
Penny, your nails look great.

153
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,280
谢谢  我是在阿罕布拉宫找到这地方的
Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra.

154
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,750
是在一个女士地下廉价商场里
It's in a woman's basement.

155
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,150
虽然我觉得那只是拉皮条的幌子
I think it's a front for human trafficking,

156
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,020
不过他们的手艺倒真是不错
but they do a really good job.

157
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,050
我的一个同事的毕业论文就写的是
A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus

158
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,820
消毒不当的美甲工具上滋生的霉菌
that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements.

159
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,760
别说这不是女生话题
Well don't tell me that's not "girl talk".

160
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,700
我们今晚去哪好呢
So where should we go tonight?

161
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,900
酒吧  俱乐部  还是去看电影呢
A bar? A club? A movie?

162
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,530
或者我们也可以待在这
Or we could just stay here.

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,140
没错  继续交流感情
Yes, a continue to bond.

164
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,840
我预感今晚过后
I have a feeling that after tonight,

165
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,340
你们其中一个将成为我一辈子的好友
one of you will become my best friend forever.

166
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,380
或是"死党"  要是你们喜欢的话
Or "BFF," if you prefer.

167
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,740
我不喜欢
Which I don't.

168
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,050
好吧  开了单身二号吧[纯应景]
All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.

169
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,450
我觉得我不应该再喝了
Gee, I don't know if I should drink more.

170
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,650
我还得开车回家呢  我现在的视力
I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble

171
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,390
就已经看不清仪表盘了
seeing over the dashboard as it is.

172
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,730
没关系  你可以在我这睡
That's okay. You can just sleep here.

173
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,060
太棒了  睡衣派对
Oh, good, a slumber party!

174
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,400
我们可以变装  打耍人电话
We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls,

175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,370
然后穿着蕾丝睡衣玩枕头大战
and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!

176
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,900
天啊  艾米
Oh, gosh, Amy.

177
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,370
我不确定这是你所想的那种睡衣派对
I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.

178
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,910
太让人失望了
Well, that's disappointing.

179
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,510
我一直都想被人邀请去睡衣派对的
I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.

180
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,010
你从没参加过吗
Oh, you never were?

181
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,510
小的时候也没有吗
Not even when you were a kid?

182
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,050
有一次我做完切除扁桃体的手术以后
Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out,

183
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,480
跟一个越南女孩一起住在病房里
and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl.

184
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,290
结果她半夜就死了
She didn't make it through the night,

185
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,490
但是在那之前  都还挺好玩的
but up till then, it was kind of fun.

186
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,030
好吧  那我们就搞个睡衣派对吧
Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party.

187
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,060
枕头大战
Pillow fight!

188
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,640
希望他们能早点放我们进去
Oh, I hope they let us in soon.

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,170
我不想总是跑到加油站去上厕所了
I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom.

190
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,340
加油站那家伙每次都逼我买佳得乐
The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time.

191
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,780
简直是恶性循环
It's a vicious circle.

192
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,780
可惜你没有排队伴侣
Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.

193
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,150
什么是排队伴侣
What's a stadium pal?

194
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,780
这么说吧
Let me put it this way:

195
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,590
它能解决厕所问题
takes care of the bathroom problem,

196
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,120
还能给你的小腿保暖
and it keeps your calf warm.

197
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,660
伙计们  坏消息  我刚刚算了一下
Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation.

198
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,130
根据电影院的大小和队伍的长度
Given the size of the theater and the length of this line,

199
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,830
我们可能没座位了
we might not get seats.

200
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,130
他说什么
What did he say?

201
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,370
干得好  拉杰
Nice going, Raj.

202
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,170
好不容易让他睡觉的
Just got him down for his nap.

203
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,640
我们有可能买不到票
We might not get seats?!

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,310
肯定有的  放心  继续睡觉吧
It's fine, it's fine.Go back to sleep.

205
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,740
我早知会过你们了  我早知会过你们了
Oh, I informed you thusly! I so informed you thusly.

206
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,450
霍华德  你来安抚他吧
Howard, you talk to him.

207
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,750
霍华德
Howard?

208
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,590
你在尿尿  对吧
You're peeing, aren't you?

209
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,760
瞧瞧谁来了
Hey, look who's here!

210
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,490
你们好啊  伙计们
Hey, buddies!

211
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,090
这不是《星际迷航》里的
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

212
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,130
加·加·宾克斯——威尔·惠顿吗
the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.

213
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,770
偶们觉得你形容得真有意思[模仿加·加·宾克斯说话]
(la Ja Ja Binks)Mee-sa think that very funny!

214
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,640
你偶等可以排到最后面  慢慢回味
Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line.

215
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,010
不能插队  没有但是  没有椰汁
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

216
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,680
威尔·惠顿
Wil Wheaton.

217
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,440
我就是
Yeah.

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
我可是你的忠实粉丝
I'm a big fan.

219
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,980
粉什么  那把修整不齐的络腮胡吗
Of what? Poorly executed beards?

220
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
你有办法能让我和我的朋友进去看电影吗
Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie?

221
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,250
因为我们来得有点晚了
We got here a little late.

222
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,050
没问题  跟我来  我带你们进去
No problem. Come on, I'll hook you up.

223
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,490
太棒了
Awesome.

224
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,860
偶们要进去看电影了  拜拜
We-sa gonna go into the movie now! Bye-bye!

225
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,830
现在放的是《夺宝奇兵》
This is Indiana Jones,

226
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,730
不是《星际迷航》
not Star Trek.

227
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,670
像这种伪名人根本不值得为他开后门
There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here!

228
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,340
即使是在《星际迷航》里
And even at Star Trek conventions,

229
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,270
如果他是来帮忙的  才放他进去呢
they only let him in if he helps set up!

230
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,940
淡定  谢尔顿
Calm down, Sheldon.

231
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,440
才不淡定呢
I will not calm down.

232
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,450
我们不能默许这种对公平和规矩公然侮辱的行为
This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered.

233
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,210
让·吕克·皮卡特船长曾经说过
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said,

234
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,280
"忍无可忍  无须再忍"
"The line must be drawn here!

235
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,920
"这就是底线  绝不后退半步"
"This far, no farther!"

236
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,160
你非得把他弄醒  这下爽了吧
Had to wake him up from his nap, didn't you?

237
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,330
你们知道我最爱霍华德什么吗
You know what I really love about Howard?

238
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,130
他的胸毛
His chest hair.

239
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,800
霍华德胸前还毛茸茸的啊
Howard has a hairy chest?

240
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
不  就一根
No, just the one.

241
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,240
但是真的很长
But it's really long.

242
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,480
好了  你看  热辣的日出红
Okay, there you go-- Sultry Sunrise Red.

243
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

244
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,820
我的指甲从来没有这么漂亮过
My nails have never looked so pretty before.

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,780
洗掉
Get it off.

246
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,020
哇  哇  好像开始
Oh, oh, uh, looks like they're getting ready

247
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
让人进场了
to let people in.

248
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,130
听听威尔·惠顿先生是怎么在推特上炫耀的
Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting.

249
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,930
"坐在电影院最棒的位置上看《夺宝奇兵》
"Best seats in house for Raiders screening.

250
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,100
羡慕嫉妒恨吧  谢尔顿·库珀"
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

251
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,870
你为什么要他看的推特
Why do you read his Twitter feed?

252
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,770
明知道那只会让自己不高兴
You know it's only going to upset you.

253
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,040
知己知彼  方能百战不殆   莱纳德
I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,410
如果早几百年有推特  卡斯特上将
Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer
[小巨角战役  是印第安战争的史诗]

255
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,750
会不去关注史汀·布尔的吗
have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull?

256
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,150
李将军不会关注格兰特将军的吗
Would not Lee have followed Grant?
[尤利塞斯·S·格兰特和罗伯特·E·李签订了北部弗吉尼亚李军队投降的条约]

257
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,720
难道间谍之间不会互相关注吗
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

258
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,420
我还能举更多例子  但我要先接个电话
I have more examples, but excuse me.

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,090
喂
Hello.

260
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,520
居然选择这种奇怪的时间来测试
Well, this seems like an odd time

261
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,990
我的电话通话质量  不过继续吧
to test my cell phone quality, but go on.

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,260
测试词组  好吧
Test phrases? All right.

263
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,230
我是个十
Im a tote.

264
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,270
足的傻
Ulba.

265
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,840
子
Twad.

266

连起来说吗
All together?

267

我是个十足的傻子
I'm a total buttwad.

268
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,350
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

269
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,750
还在吗
Hello?

And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.

271

我不确定我有没有
I'm not sure I grasp

272
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,960
完全领会到笑点在哪  不过还凑合吧
the full entertainment value, but all right.

273
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,590

等下  不是这样的  艾米
Wait. No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her

286
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,160
你要问一些私人的或者尴尬的问题
something personal or embarrassing.

287
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
好  我懂了

291
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,170
真是厚颜无耻
Oh, the gall.

292
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,780
我真希望他下一条推特是  "爆米花卡到气管里

299
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,720
你能不能通融一下
Isn't there anything you can do?

300
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,330
抱歉  影院防火规定不能超员
Sorry. Fire regulations.

301
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,530
你们应该早点来排队
Should've gotten here earlier.

302
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,300
这明显就是卑鄙的职员
This is nothing but ablatant abuse of power

303
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,030
在滥用权利

306
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,840
因为我是个手里有权的小气职员  小子
'Cause I'm the petty functionary with a clipboard, bitch.

307
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,810
看来就这样了
I guess that's that.

308
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,680
回家吧
Let's go home.

309
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,310
我想用回那句"我早说过的"
You know what? I'm going back to "I told you so."

310
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,380
我早说过的
I told you so.

311
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,450

I guess we'd bettergo after him.

317
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,900
肖特·朗德

Yeah, I know who itis, but why is it me?

320
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,310
对  应该叫个可爱的亚裔男孩
You're right. It shouldbe a cuddly Asian boy.

321
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,270
比如我

还让尼古拉的屁股烫了一下

324
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,820
故事说完了  愿上帝保佑大家
This tale is done, and God save all the rout."

325
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,460
这什么玩意儿

要是14世纪的人穿袜子的话
It would have been hidden in sock drawers

329
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,340
就该把它塞在脏袜子抽屉里
if people in the 14th century had worn socks.

330
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,810
我觉得这段子挺给力的
I thought it was pretty spicy.

331
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,680
尤其是亲吻她下面那只眼那段
Especially the part where he kisses her nether eye.

332
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,310
你要是知道那指什么
You might not like it as much

333
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,010
可能就不会很喜欢了
if you knew what "nether eye" meant.

334
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,980
提示  要是很注意卫生的人
Hint: if one cares about hygiene,

335

339
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,690
你为什么还一直跟莱纳德在一起
Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much

340
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,190
即便你们已经分手了
even though you broke up with him?

341
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,560
真是个好问题
Oh, that's an excellent question.

342
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,870
对于已经分手不是一对的两人
For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded,

343
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,300

you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company.

344
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,970
是啊

345
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,010
我选大冒险
Dare.

346
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,810
规则肯定不会允许
I don't believe the rules allow

347
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,680
你临时更改选择的
for an ex post facto option change.

348
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,280
是啊
Yeah.

349
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,980
我们只是不再是男女朋友
Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore

350
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,720
并不意味着不再是朋友
doesn't meanwe can't be friends.

351
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,620
毕竟莱纳德是个好人
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

352
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,720
那你为什么要跟他分手
Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?

353
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,120
我不知道
I don't know.

354
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,990
他太认真了  而我还没准备好
He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.

355
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
有意思
Interesting.

356
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,030
那如果以后
How will you react if, in the future,

357
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,170
你准备好了  而莱纳德已另结新欢
you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable,

358
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,270
因为另外有个女人意识到
because another woman has realized that he is--

359
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,440
用你的话说"他是个好人"  那你怎么办
to use your words--"a great guy"?

360
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,740
你只能问一个问题
You can only ask one question.

361
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,040
那问后面一个
That one.

362
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,680
我不想玩这个游戏了
You know what,  I don't want to play anymore.

363
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,490
不知道这游戏怎么算得分
Well, I'm not sure how this is scored,

364
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,890
但相信我们俩赢了这局
but I believe we may have won.

365
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,530

谢尔顿
Sheldon?

367
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,600
你去哪了
Where did he go?

368
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,610
我们在找谢尔顿  不是马默杜克[大丹麦狗]
We're looking for Sheldon,not Marmaduke.

369
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,850
你刚吹口哨了?
You whistled?

370
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,180
这是什么
What is that?

我看不到  别人也休想看到
If I can't see it, no one else can see it.

374
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,660
谢尔顿  你疯了
Sheldon, this is crazy.

375
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,360
不  放映室没人看管那才叫疯了
No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.

376
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,860
听我说
Listen to me.

377
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,230
你累过头了  没法正确思考
You are over-tired. You're not thinking right.

378
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,670
趁麻烦还没惹大  赶紧放回去
Put the movie back before we get into trouble.

379
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,730
麻烦就是我的中间名  莱纳德

380
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,500
其实是李  但我喜欢用"麻烦"
Actually, it's Lee,but I prefer Trouble.

381
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,970
看看他们放谁进来了

别担心  威尔·惠顿  我正准备走

392
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,030
