1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,200
《生活大爆炸》前情回顾
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,720
我和莱纳德  沃罗威茨  库萨帕里
I am going to the Arctic Circle

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,850
要去北极圈
with Leonard, Walowitz, and Koothrappali.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,600
-去三个月  -没错
- For three months?  - Yes.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,560
你说会想我是什么意思
What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,700
意思是我不想你走
It means I wish you weren't going.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,100
[三个月后]

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
谢天谢地  到家了
Oh, thank God we're home.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,640
难以置信我们在那冰冷的地狱呆了3个月
I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,150
简直就是个噩梦
It was like a snowy nightmare

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,100
梦里漫天飞雪  而又无法醒来
from which there was no awakening.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,000
我不知道你们对北极考察的感想
I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys were on,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,110
我只觉得意犹未尽
but I thought it was a hoot and a half.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,050
你好  妈妈
Oh, hi, Mom.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,220
不  我说了  到家了再打电话给你
No, I told you I'd call you when I got home.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,400
我还没到家呢
I'm not home yet.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,580
行了  到家了
All right, I'm home.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,400
北极考察非常成功
The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success.

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,860
说不定我将来能得一个诺贝尔奖
I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,180
其实  不应该这样说
Actually, I shouldn't say that.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,950
我完全确定能得
I'm entirely certain.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,170
不  妈妈  我感觉不到
No, Mother, I could not feel

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,580
你的教会小组为我祈祷平安
your church group praying for my safty.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,400
就算我平安回家也不证明祈祷有效
The fact that I'm home safe does not prove that it worked.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,280
这个逻辑完全是个谬误
The logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,300
不  我没有用爱斯基摩口吻跟你顶嘴
No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,420
我去告诉佩妮我们回来了
I'm gonna go let Penny know we're back.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,820
妈妈  我得挂了
Mother, I have to go.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,040
爱你  拜
Yeah, love you. Bye.

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,640
好啊  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,490
爹爹回来了
Daddy's home.

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,830
莱纳德  你回来啦
Leonard, you're back.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,020
对  我过来跟你说...
Yeah. I just stopped by to say-- hmph!

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,160
-嗨  -嗨
- Yeah. So, hi.  - Hi.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,700
妈的  早知道我先来说我们回来了
Damn it, I should have gone over and told her we were back.

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,170
就是  先到先得嘛
Yeah, it was first-come, first-serve.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
生活大爆炸第三季第一集

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,010
先跟你们俩声明
I just want you both to know,

39
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,450
等我发表我的发现时
When I publish my findings,

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,490
我不会忘记你们的付出的
I won't forget your contributions.

41
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,850
-太好了  -谢谢
- Great.  - Thanks.

42
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,020
但在诺贝尔领奖感言中不能提及你们
Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech,

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,760
不过写传记时
but when I get around to writing my memoirs,

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,470
我会在注脚上提到你们
you can expect a very effusive footnote

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,020
或者给你们一本我签名的传记
and perhaps a signed copy.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,280
我们得告诉他
We have to tell him.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
告诉我什么
Tell me what?

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,810
该死的瓦肯听力[星际迷航]
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,010
你们打算给我办派对  是吧
You fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,610
谢尔顿  坐
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

51
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,770
如果要搞主题派对的话  先告诉你们
If there's going to be a theme I should let you know

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,570
我不喜欢夏威夷式  罗马式和"海底式"
that I don't care for luau, toga or "under the sea."

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,940
我们会记在心里
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind. Look...

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,110
我们想谈谈在北极发生的一些事
We need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,570
如果是说没有暖气那晚的事
If this is about the night the heat went out,

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,900
没什么好害臊的
there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

57
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,520
不是那件事
It's not about that.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,970
我们说好不再提这个
And we agreed never speak of it again.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,750
不就是一起裸睡嘛
So we slept together naked.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,610
这只是以防体温骤降而已
It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,220
他还真说上了
He's speaking about it.

62
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,730
对我觉得  这可以促进我们的感情
For me, it was a bonding moment.

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,380
谢尔顿  你还记得开始几周
Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,790
我们在探测磁单极子
We were looking for magnetic monopoles

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,120
结果一无所获
And not finding anything and you were acting

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,610
你变成面目可憎的大JJ霸主吗
like an obnoxious, giant dictator?

67
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,670
我以为要婉转点跟他说呢
thought we were going to be gentle with him.

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,970
所以我才加了霸主
That's why I added the "tator."

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,030
接着终于测出一些可用数据时
And then when we finally got our first positive data,

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,570
你多高兴啊
you were so happy.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,910
是啊
Oh, yes.

72
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,090
用表情字符表达就是：D[笑脸]
In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital "D."

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,340
其实  你的仪器侦测的数据
Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected

74
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,310
不是范式转变单极子的证据
wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,260
那是...
as it was...

76
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,840
电动开罐刀具的静电
static from the electric can opener

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,520
我们在不停开关
we were turning on and off.

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,560
他的表情一下变成了：O[惊讶]
He just went colon, capital "O."

79
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,580
你们篡改了我的实验
You tampered with my experiment?

80
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,760
我们别无选择
We had to.

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,940
只有这样
It was the only way to keep you

82
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,740
你才不会变成狄更斯专家（混蛋JJ）
from being such a huge Dickensian.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,540
懂吗  我加了专家
You see that? I add the "ensian."

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,310
莱纳德知道吗
Did Leonard know about this?

85
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,180
他是我最好的朋友
Leonard's my best friend in the world.

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
他肯定不知道
Surely Leonard didn't know.

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,700
其实  这是他的主意
Actually, it was his idea.

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,530
当然是莱纳德  试验计划是他制定的
Of course it was. The whole plan weeks of Leonard.

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,030
-我好想你  -我也好想你
- I missed you so much.  - I missed you, too

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,290
你不在  我都没想其他人
I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.

91
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,770
我也是
Me, neither.

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,770
除了没有暖气那晚
Except for one night when the heat went out.

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,250
说来话长  别问了
Long story. It's... Don't ask.

94
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,150
莱纳德
Leonard.

95
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,930
别出声
Do not make a sound.

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,200
你在低声说"别出声"
Whispering, "Do not make a sound..."

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,500
就出声了
...is a sound.

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,930
该死的瓦肯听力
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

99
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,680
现在没空  谢尔顿
Not a good time, Sheldon.

100
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,740
佩妮
Penny.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,580
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny.

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,670
啊  真是要命
Oh, this is ridicules.

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,480
干嘛
What?

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,570
你好  佩妮
Hello, Penny

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,170
我明白你现在正完全被
I realize you're currently at the mercy

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,490
最原始的野性冲动所控制
of your primitive biological urges,

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,000
可是 反正你这辈子还会有
but as you have an entire lifetime

108
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,100
无数错误的决定  我能不能打断这一个?
of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
我也很高兴见到你  请进
It's great to see you too. Come on in.

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,800
沃罗威茨刚告诉我你的那个大骗局
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception.

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,580
你有没有什么要解释的
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

112
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,010
是的  我对此觉得十分难过
Yes, I feel terrible about it.

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,440
我绝不能原谅我自己  我也不准备你会
I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to, either,

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,670
我想你应该让我留在这儿跟佩妮
and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny

115
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,380
做一下自我检查和深刻忏悔
for a session of self-criticism and repentance.

116
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,870
啊  你们能不能告诉我究竟是怎么回事儿
Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?

117
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,430
事情是  他们让我以为
What's going on is I was lead to believe

118
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,550
我在科学研究上有了惊天动地的大发现
I was making groundbreaking strides in science,

119
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,960
而事实上  我记录的数据是错的
when in fact, I was being fed

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,800
是沃罗威茨和库萨帕里
false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali

121
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,410
还有你这个小毛毛孩儿做出来的
and your furry little boy toy.

122
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,110
真的吗
Is that true?

123
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,760
只有这样才能让他高兴啊
It was the only way to make him happy.

124
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,250
可是你干嘛非要让他高兴呢
Well, why'd you have to make him happy?

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,780
因为他不高兴的时候  我们都想杀了他
Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him.

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,460
我们甚至有过计划
There was even a plan.

127
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,750
我们打算把他的炉子扔到外头
We were going to throw his kindle outside,

128
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,460
等他出去捡的时候  把门锁上
and when he went to get it, lock the door

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,150
冻死他
and let him freeze to death.

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,850
这听起来有点过分吧
That seems like a bit of an overreaction.

131
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,410
这不是  过分的计划是把你四肢绑到
No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,670
四队雪撬狗上  然后大喊"驾"
to four different sled dog teams and yell, "Mush."

133
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,130
听者  我们保存了原始数据
Look, we kept the original data.

134
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,640
你还是可以发表你的结果
You can still publish the actual results.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,520
但是本来的结果失败了啊
Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,550
而我已经给大学里所有人发了电邮
and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university

137
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,270
告诉他们我证实了弦理论
explaining that I have confirmed string theory

138
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,760
并且永远地改变了人类对宇宙的认识
and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,350
啊  真是  唉  你也许不该这么做的
Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that.

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,760
那就再写一封  告诉他们真相
So write another e-mail. Set the record straight.

141
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,970
没什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,120
你说得对  莱纳德
You're right, Leonard.

143
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,590
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

144
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,570
你不过是欺骗了我  摧毁了我的梦想
All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,360
并且在全校人面前羞辱了我
and humiliate me in front of the whole university.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,430
这个  告诉你  是讽刺
That, FYI, was sarcasm.

147
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,460
事实上  我相信这是很大很大的事情
I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.

148
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,940
哦  多可怜啊
Oh, the poor thing.

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,460
是啊  我很难过
Yeah, I feel terrible.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,300
等等  你不去跟他谈谈吗
Wait wait, aren't you going to go talk to him?

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,670
什么  呃  他没事的
What? Uh, he'll be fine.

152
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,470
那家伙很坚强的  过来么
The guy's a trooper. Come here.

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,560
你说的对  你是不该跟他谈
No, you're right-- you shouldn't talk to him.

154
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,180
该我来
I will.

155
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,690
天哪  我怎么就没一点好运呢
Man, I cannot catch a break.

156
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,500
想聊聊吗
Do you want to talk?

157
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,220
聊什么
About what?

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,390
聊我是怎么被朋友欺骗的吗
Being betrayed by my friends?

159
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,780
毫无意义地在北极呆了三个月
Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?

160
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,790
我连动漫展都没去成
And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con!

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,230
哦  亲爱...
Oh, hon...

162
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,780
嗯
Uh...

163
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,280
软软的猫猫  温温的猫猫...
Soft kitty, warm kitty...

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,190
那是我生病时候唱的  伤心不是生病
That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.

165
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,540
对不起
Oh. Sorry.

166
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,860
我不知道你伤心的歌啊
I don't know your sad song.

167
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,300
我没有伤心的歌  我又不是小孩儿
I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.

168
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,480
你知道么  我其实理解你的心情
Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.

169
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,750
真的吗
Really?

170
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,880
你刚刚被人抢走了服务员的
Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,600
诺贝尔奖吗
stolen from you?

172
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,340
没有  不过我高三的时候
Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school,

173
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,730
我的一个朋友听说
one of my friends heard

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,720
我会被选为啦啦队的队长
I was going to be named head cheerleader.

175
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,370
哦  我那个高兴啊
Oh, I was so excited.

176
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,070
我妈甚至给我烤了一个庆祝馅饼
My mom even made me a celebration pie.

177
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,060
结果他们把队长给了那个笨透了的瓦丽瑞·马斯巴赫
Then they named stupid Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.

178
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,600
那个贱货
Big old slutbag.

179
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,790
你是说
Are you saying

180
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,160
你认为"庆祝馅饼"
that you think a "celebtion pie"

181
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,390
能跟诺贝尔奖相提并论吗
is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?

182
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,030
嗯  那馅饼很好吃呢
Well, they're pretty tasty.

183
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,320
还有一个不同的  但并非完全无关的事情
And on a different, but not unrelated topic,

184
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,200
就看你现在对我的鼓励方式
based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits,

185
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,570
你难道真相信你能胜任
do you truly believe that you were ever fit

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,770
给运动员加油的工作吗
to be a cheer leader?

187
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,810
听着  谢尔顿  我只是不认为
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think

188
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,140
莱纳德他们真想伤害你
that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you.

189
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,460
你明白吗  他们只是为了摆脱困境
You know? They just told an unfortunate lie

190
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,520
而撒了个很糟的谎
to deal with a difficult situation.

191
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,110
好吧  你知道是什么样吗
Okay, you know what it's like?

192
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,560
记得那个新的《星际迷航》电影里
Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie

193
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,530
柯克要占领飞船
when Kirk has to take over the ship,

194
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,700
他就对史波克说了很多谎
so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true,

195
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,290
比如说史波克不在乎他妈妈的死之类的
like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?

196
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,950
我错过了动漫展  连新的《星际迷航》电影也错过啦
I missed Comic- Con and the new Star Trek movie!

197
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,910
我喜欢你的新造型
I like the new look.

198
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,960
谢谢
Thanks.

199
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,760
我称之为"克鲁尼" [著名演员]
I call it "the Clooney."

200
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,200
我称之为"玛丽和路易" [超级玛丽游戏系列]  不过无所谓
I call it "the Mario and Luigi but whatever.

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,440
嘿 谢尔顿怎么样了
Hey, how's sheldon doing?

202
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,280
他早上从他房间出来时
Well, he came out of his room this morning

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,730
带着黑武士头盔
wearing his Darth Vader helmet and

204
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,770
想用“能量”砍死我
trying to chop me to death with the "force"

205
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,870
所以我觉得他好点了
so I would say "a little better."

206
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,310
请原谅我突然改变我们的话题
If I may abruptly change the subject,

207
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,480
你最终有没有跟佩妮那样
did you and Penny finally... you know.

208
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,300
-霍华德 -我本人是不关心
- Howard... - Personally, I don't care,

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,550
但是我的小弟弟叫我问你
but my genitals wanted me to ask.

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,940
告诉你的小弟弟
Well tell your genitals

211
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,970
我跟佩妮的进展不关他的事
what I do with Penny is none of their business.

212
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,910
他说他们没发生那种事
He says they didn't do it.

213
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,250
谢尔顿 这边
Sheldon, over here.

214
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,700
你在做什么
What are you doing?

215
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,750
他让我感到难受
well, I feel bad for the guy.

216
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,000
谢尔顿 你为什么单独坐在那里
Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?

217
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,680
因为我没有朋友
Because I am without friends.

218
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,280
我就像德国童谣唱的奶酪一样  独自生存
Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone.

219
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,210
[德语]独自就座
Evenhile seated.

220
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,970
拜托 我们向你道歉了
Come on. We said we we sorry.

221
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,900
你的一句"我很抱歉"
It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry"

222
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,030
和从佩妮店里面买的道歉馅饼
and a store-bought apology pie from Penny

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,980
都不能抵消你们对我犯下的罪行
to make up for what you've done to me.

224
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,020
嘿 库珀
Hey, Cooper.

225
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,710
我看到了你发的收回信
Read your retraction email.

226
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,130
这下你的名誉可毁了
Way to destroy your reputation.

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,990
看到了吧
You see?

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,610
整个早上人们一直指指点点嘲笑我
People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.

229
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,060
不光是今天早上
That's not true.

230
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,960
人们一直都在指指点点嘲笑你
People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.

231
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,860
好了 我受够了
All right, I've had enough.

232
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,270
各位请注意
Attention, everyone.

233
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,100
我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

234
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,460
正如你们中的许多来自物理系的人所知
As many of you in the physics department might know,

235
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,420
我的事业轨迹出现了小小的曲折
my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.

236
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,140
坠下了悬崖
Off a cliff.

237
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,780
我的名誉多少受到了点损坏
My credibility may have been damaged

238
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,040
彻底损坏了
Completely wrecked.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,900
但是我想提醒各位的是
But I would like to remind you that in science,

240
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,580
在科学领域不存在失败
there's no such thing as failure.

241
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,990
曾有一个人因为
There once was a man who was referred to his prediction

242
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,170
他对一个宇宙常数的预测而被称为他事业中的最大错误
of a cosmological constant as the single "biggest blunder"

243
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
这个人的名字就是
of his career. That man's name was--

244
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,030
你们猜  你们猜
surprise, surprise--

245
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,320
爱因斯坦
Albert Einstein.

246
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,270
但是暗能量的研究
Yeah, but research into Dark Energy

247
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,250
证明爱因斯坦的宇宙常数
proved that Einstein's cosmological constant

248
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,450
是一直正确的  所以你仍然是一个
was actually right all along, so you're still--

249
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,810
你们猜  你们猜
surprise, surprise--

250
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,130
失败者
a loser.

251
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,350
哦  你以为你很聪明
Oh, you think you're so clever.

252
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,690
但是  让我来告诉你
Well, let me just tell you,

253
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,610
虽然我现在想不出尖刻的话来反驳你
while I do not currently have a scathing retort,

254
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,940
但我想到之后会发邮件给你的
you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.

255
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,180
我们和谢尔顿的友谊算是完了
So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,260
不过暖气停了的那晚将会一直留在我们的记忆中
Well, we always have the night the heat went out.

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,430
-嗨 -嘿
- Hi.  - Hey.

258
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,030
以为我们昨天晚上被打断了
Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night,

259
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,070
我没找到机会给你这个
I didn't have a chance to give you this.

260
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,640
哦  莱纳德  你不用这样的
Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have.

261
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,310
哦  天哪
Oh, boy!

262
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,510
这是什么
What is it?

263
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,440
一片雪花
It's a snowflake.

264
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,870
北极的雪花
From the North Pole.

265
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,970
真的吗
Are you serious?

266
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,140
是啊
Uh-huh.

267
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,270
永不变质的
It'll last forever.

268
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,570
我把它保存在纯净的 聚乙烯醇缩醛树脂里了
I preserved  in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.

269
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,470
天哪
Oh, my God.

270
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,610
这是我听到但没能理解的话中
That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me

271
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,170
最浪漫的一句
that I didn't understand.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,470
其实这个过程挺简单的
It's actually a pretty simple process.

273
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,510

他不接电话

278

向学校提交了辞职报告

279
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,070
他还发短信给我说  “我跑了”
and he sent me a text that said, "I'm running away."

280
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,110

286
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,540

是谢尔顿他妈

我算是走不了运了
A break cannot be caught.

293
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,340
是的  我想是我们的错
Yes... I guess it is kind of our fault.

294
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,440
不不不  你是对的 是要有人跟他谈谈
No, no, no. You-you're right. Someone needs to come talk to him.

295
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,870
别担心  我会处理的
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

301
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,210
我刚刚送给你雪花
Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake

302
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,580
我们正在接吻

303
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,820
拜托  我可不想这时候去得克萨斯
Oh, come on, I don't want to go to Texas!

304
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,430
你以为我想去
Oh, right, and I do?

305
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,360
我们犹太人已经穿越了一次沙漠了 [圣经故事]
My people already crossed a desert once.

306
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,760

309
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,900
你怎么能不去呢  他是你最好的朋友
how can you not go? He's your best friend.

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,610
没错  但他的裸体我已经看过了
Yeah, but I already saw him naked.

311
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,030
我保证我会等着你回来
I promise I will be he when you get back.

312

放心去帮谢尔顿吧

真的
Really?

314
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,230
是啊  我们已经等了几个月了 再等几天又有何妨
Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.

315
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,730
你也许能等
Maybe you can.

316
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,030
快去
Go.

317

天  你算是走不了运了
Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?

-给你  谢利  -谢谢  妈

- Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.- Aw, Mom.

321
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,870
又不是在加利福尼亚  都是异教徒
This is not California, land of the heathen.

322
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,350

- For every cup and every... - ...plateful. Amen.

327
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,770
也没什么难的  是吧
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

328
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,290
我拒绝是基于个人意愿
My objection was based on considerations

329
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,530
而不是难度
Other than difficulty.

330
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,370
不管怎样   耶稣仍然爱你
Whatever. Jesus still loves you.

331
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,040
谢谢你帮我在烤芝士三明治上刻了个笑脸
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.

332

我知道怎么关心我的宝贝

333

他的眼睛烤得有点细
His eyes cames out a little thin,

334
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,580
不过你可以把他假想为中国人
But you can just pretend he's Chinese.

335
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,190
想谈谈你跟你朋友们怎么回事吗
Do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?

336
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,040
-他们才不是我朋友  -好吧
- They're not my friends. - All right.

337
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,550
回想一下  你小的时候
If you recall, when you were little,

338
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,690
我们也是就坐在这里
we sat right here at this very spot

339
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,490
也是这样谈起
We talked about some of the problems

That was different.

342
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,390
他们是因我的智慧而感受到威胁
They were threatened by my intelligence

343
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,560
又蠢得不知道这点  因此才恨我的
And too stupid to know that's why they hated me.

344
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,760
宝贝  他们很清楚自己为什么恨你
Oh baby, they knew very well why they hate you.

345
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,100
真不敢相信你还真买了顶红色牛仔帽
I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.

346
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,780
配我里面穿的红色高领毛衣啊
Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck

347
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,550
再说  童装大号的只有这个色
Plus, it was the only boys' large they had.

348
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,210
抱歉  可这真不像德克萨斯
I'm sorry, this does not look like Texas.

349
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,650
风滚草呢  小酒馆呢 [老电影中德州常见景象]
Where's the tumbleweeds? Whe's the saloons?

350
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,360
小酒馆
Saloons?

351
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,850
对  像我从小在印度看的电影里那种
Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India.

352
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,270
比如《德州四杰》[1963年老电影]《德克萨斯的黄玫瑰》[民歌]
You know, uh, Four for Texas,  Yellow Rose of Texes.

353
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,150
这附近更像是电锯版的德州
This neighborhood is more likeTexas Chainsaw

354
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,780
我原指望能看到牛仔赶牛
I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.

355
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,230
怎么说呢
What can I tell you?

356
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,260
那边那家贼大的好市多[连锁超市]  可能会有牛排出售
They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.

357
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,340
能不能把那顶讨厌的帽子给摘了
Will you please take that stupid hat off?

358
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,330
不行  我得入乡随俗
No, I want to blend in.

359
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,690
入什么乡  玩具总动员
To what? Toy Story?

360
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,360
你们好  孩子们

想喝点什么吗
Can .. Can I get you something to drink?

365

不用了  谢谢
Uh, no, thank you.

366
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,880
不介意的话  我很想见识下孤星啤酒[德州特产]
If you don't mind,I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.

367
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,000
我们家禁止饮酒
There's no alcohol in this household.

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,630
别这么说话[指他学德州口音]  把帽子摘了
Stop talking like that and lose the hat.

369
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,060
抱歉  有的话给我杯低糖哟呵[巧克力饮料]
Sorry, I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.

就给你可乐吧
You'll take a Coke.

371
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,290
你呢  你叫拉吉[名字搞错了啦]  对吗
What about you? Radge, isn't it?

372
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,800
还是不敢跟女的讲话是吧
Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies?

373
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,860
我们教堂里
Because, you know, at our church,

374
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,270
有位女士  是位了不起的治疗师
We have a woman who's an amazing healer.

375
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,540
多数时候她都在治疗柱拐杖和坐轮椅的
Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people,

376
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,300
但我敢打赌  她一定愿意试试帮你治疗
But I bet she'd be willing to take a shot

377
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,780
不管你中的是什么第三世界的邪
At whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.

There's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angele

And you have no idea how much I want to be on it.

381
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,710

说话注意点  谢利

人人都有表达自己意见的权利
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

395
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,110
进化论不是种意见  而是事实
Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.

396
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,110
这种一家之言  也只是你的意见
And that is your opinion.

397
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,510
我原谅你们了  我们回家
I forgive you. Let's go home.

398
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,380
谁说祈祷没有用

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,370
太好了  总算走运了一回
How about that.I finally caught a break.

You know how they say when friends have sex,it can get weird?

为什么非得变奇怪
Why does it have to get weird?

403
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,240
我不知道
I don't know.

404
