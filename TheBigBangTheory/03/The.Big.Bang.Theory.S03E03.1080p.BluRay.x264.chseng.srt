1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,710
今晚我要出去  心情大好
I'm going out tonight, I'm feelin' alright

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,790
我要好好爽一下
Gonna let it all hang out

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,830
放声歌唱  升三个八度
Wanna make some noise, really raise my voice

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,870
耶  我要大唱大叫
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,410
滴滴啦啦
De-de-de, de-de-de-de-de, uh

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,120
不  早安  谢尔顿  和我一起跳舞吧
No.. Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,360
不要
No.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,930
干嘛不要
Why not?

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,430
佩妮  我支持"多个世界"理论
Penny, while I subscribe to

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,930
这个理论表明
The "many worlds" theory which pots the existence

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,530
在无限个宇宙中存在着
Of an infinite number of sheldons

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
无限个谢尔顿
In an infinite number of universes,

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,620
我向你保证其中没一个"我"是在跳舞的
I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,940
那这些"你"里有没有幽默一点的
Are you fun in any of them?

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,860
根据推算
The math would suggest

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,630
其中有几个"我"是糖娃娃
That in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,590
但是绝不跳舞
But I don't dance.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,870
行吧  来点法式吐司不
Alright, want some French toast?

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,970
今天是燕麦粥日
It's oatmeal day.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,440
这样吧  下个法式吐司日  我给你煮燕麦粥
Tell you what, next French toast day, I'll make you oatmeal.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,140
神啊  你还要在这赖到法式吐司日啊
Dear lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,570
早啊
Morning.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,550
莱纳德  你看啊
Look, Leonard,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,490
佩妮烤了法式吐司
Penny made French toast.

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,890
抱歉我还没给她你的用餐日程表
Sorry I haven't given her your schedule yet.

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,520
那是个iCal[Apple电子日程表]下载啊
It's an iCal download.

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,260
她可以直接下到手机里的
She can put it right in her phone.

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,980
而且我想咱们说好了的
And I thought we agreed

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,580
你们只在她那儿行房事
That you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,500
是说好了  但是现在是特殊情况
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,570
我明白了
I see.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,030
她浑身的傻气
Did her abysmal housekeeping skills

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,840
终于被她那盖世的家务活能力打压下去了是吗
Finally trump her perkiness?

34
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,080
不  是她的床有点散架了
No, her bed kind of... Broke.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
这是不太可能的
That doesn't seem likely.

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,730
她的床的构造很结实
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,620
就算多承重一个
Even the addition of a second

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,300
正常体型的人类也不会引致其床架松动的
Normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure,

39
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,170
更别提像你这样的小雏形人了
Much less a homunculus such as yourself.

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,610
小雏形人
A homunculus?

41
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,030
功能健全的迷你型人类
Perfectly formed miniature human being.

42
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,430
你这我的小宝贝雏形人
Oh, you're my little homunculus.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
别这样
Don't do that.

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,950
抱歉
Sorry.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
好啦  谁要普通糖浆谁要肉桂糖浆呀
Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,790
我要燕麦粥
I want oatmeal.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,960
行啊
Yes, well

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,160
我想要个室友不是大混蛋的男朋友
I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,840
这个愿望很快就能实现了
I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,980
但我还是要燕麦粥
But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,680
得了  我投降
You know what, I give up.

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,880
怎么会有他这种人
He's impossible.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,740
怎么会没有  我就是存在的
I can't be impossible, I exist.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,590
我相信你想说的是
I believe what you meant to say is,

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
"我投降  这种人几乎是不存在的"
"I give up, he's improbable."

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,780
谢尔顿  你真得换个方式
Sheldon, you really need to find a better way

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,030
和佩妮相处了
Of dealing with penny.

58
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,270
那我该怎么做
What am I supposed to do--

59
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,070
在礼拜一吃法式吐司吗
Eat french toast on a Monday?

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,770
这种情况才是不存在的
Now, that would be impossible.

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,460
我只是说  你想抓苍蝇的话得用蜂蜜
I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey

62
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,660
而不是醋
Than with vinegar.

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,780
你用粪粪还能抓更多呢
You can catch even more flies with manure.

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,150
你到底想说什么
What's your point?

65
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,780
这个...
It's a...

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,590
天  还挺香的呢
Boy, that does smell good.

67
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,040
太遗憾了  今儿就是礼拜一
Too bad it's Monday.

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
生活大爆炸第三季第三集

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,710
我们经理基姆去休产假了
Okay, Kim the night manager went on maternity leave

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,430
她老公叫桑迪
And her husband's name is Sandy, right?

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
然后
So get this--

72
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,990
顶她班的是一个叫桑迪的女人
Her replacement is a woman named Sandy

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,360
而她老公叫基姆
Whose husband's name is Kim.

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,780
-哇啊  -是啊
- Wow!  - I know!

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
这什么概率哦
What are the odds?

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,700
很好算嘛
Easily calculable.

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,620
先找到几对双方都取中性名字的
We begin by identifying a set of married couples

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,020
已婚夫妇
With unisex names.

79
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,400
然后剔除那些不适合
We then eliminate those unqualified

80
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,120
从事餐饮工作的
For restaurant work--

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,720
比如说年老的  坐牢的  残疾的
The aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example,

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,910
-再然后就  -谢尔顿
- Next we look at... - Sheldon--

83
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,580
这是一个奇妙的巧合
It's an amazing coincidence.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,130
就这样了行吗
Can we leave it at that?

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,330
对不起
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,830
喔佩妮  你们奶酪蛋糕工厂就好像是巫婆们开的
Ooh, Penny. It's as if the cheese-cake factory is run by witches.

87
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,910
喔谢尔顿  别以为我不会揍你
Ooh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,350
行啦  你俩  别吵了
Come on, you guys, let it go.

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,530
哼  随便吧
Fine, whatever.

90
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,020
你吃完了吗
Are you finished?

91
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,480
谢了
Well, thank you.

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,400
多么体贴
How thoughtful.

93
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,400
你要吃巧克力吗
Would you like a chocolate?

94
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,370
好啊
Um, yeah, sure.

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
多谢啦
Thanks.

96
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,430
这算什么
What was that?

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,220
你让我对佩妮好点的
You said be nice to Penny.

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,000
我觉得给别人喂巧克力
I believe offering chocolate to someone

99
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,270
能够符合"好"的定义
Falls within the definition of nice.

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,690
没错
It does.

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,360
但就我观察  你这人不符合
But in my experience, you don't.

102
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,980
何瑞修  宇宙间无奇不有
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

103
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,970
不是你的哲学全能梦想得到的[哈姆雷特 第一幕;第五景]
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy

104
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,720
这才是你嘛
Now that's you

105
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,940
讨厌而且让人难以忍受
Obnoxious and insufferable.

106
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,080
日居者们  你们好啊
What's going on, day dwellers?

107
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,030
KISS[美重金属乐队]粉丝团也废除了"不许问不许说"[美军处理同性恋旧政策]吗
Oh, man, did the kiss army repeal "don't ask, don't tell"?

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,240
不是
No.

109
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,400
我和拉杰要去好莱坞的哥特夜总会
Raj and I are going to a goth club in Hollywood

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,440
和夜猫子一起玩儿
To hang with the night people.

111
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,840
有人想一起去吗
Anybody want to come along?

112
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,450
你真要这样上街吗
Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?

113
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,000
不不
No, no.

114
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,800
我要这样上街
I'm going out like this...

115
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,970
霍华德  你做了些什么
Howard, what did you do?

116
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,500
这叫纹身袖
They're called tattoo sleeves.

117
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,620
看
Look.

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,930
我在网上买的  拉杰也买了一身
I go them online! Raj got a set, too..

119
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,310
帅死了  是吧
Fantastic, right?

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,520
穿上它  就能和前卫女孩
Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,520
发生韵事  脱下他
With her business pierced, take them off,

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,100
我依旧是个恪礼守节的犹太人
I can still be buried in a jewish cemetery.

123
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,610
知道吗
You know, I've always wanted

124
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,810
我一直都想去哥特夜总会
To go to a goth nightclub.

125
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,810
真的吗
Really?

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,080
才怪呢
Bazinga!

127
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,650
没有人能察觉到我的玩笑  对吧
None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?

128
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,580
你们俩去吗
Okay, how about you two?

129
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,200
我还带了几个纹身袖
Look, I've got some extra tatoo sleeves.

130
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,320
你带那么多干什么
Why are you carrying extras?

131
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,330
万一被哪个女人的乳环刮破了好有个替换呀
In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.

132
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,930
我们就不去了
Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
你现在就得"妻管严"了吗
Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?

134
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,100
这件事  肯定她说了算
In this case, you bet she is.

135
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,890
是啊  她很强势  他受压迫
Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped,

136
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,730
但是不能这么说
But that's not the expression.

137
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,650
快走  我要去沃尔格林药店
Come on, I want to stop at walgreens

138
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,520
再多买几支眼线笔
And pick up some more eyeliner.

139
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,690
他们在夜总会要被揍了
They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,890
我看他们在药店就会被揍
They're gonna get beaten up at walgreens.

141
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,470
抱歉  谢尔顿
Oh, sorry, Sheldon.

142
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,870
我差点坐在你的专座上
I almost sat in your spot.

143
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,720
是吗  我都没注意
Did you? I didn't notice.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,670
给你块巧克力吧
Have a chocolate.

145
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,670
谢谢
Thank you.

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,870
我觉得我们很适合这里
I think we're fitting quite nicely.

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,940
要是你不喝低度啤酒就更好了
It did help if you weren't drinking light beer.

148
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,130
喝伏特加和蔓越莓果汁就显得比我更有哥特风格吗
What's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?

149
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,750
是啊  这看起来像在饮血
Hello? It looks like blood.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,620
你没去看我发给你的
Did you even read the "wiki how" link

151
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,330
手把手学哥特风格的WikiHow链接吗
I sent you on being goth?

152
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,000
没  我自己的东西还看不玩呢
No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading.

153
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,810
我正在读约翰·格里沙姆[法律惊悚小说《掮客》作者]
I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.

154
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
什么
What?

155
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,920
我看完了《绝对机密》
I finished reading The Pelican Brief

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,400
我太喜欢了  已经完全身临其境了
And loved it so much, I dived right into the client.

157
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,430
他本身就是个律师
He was a lawyer himself,

158
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,130
所以他的小说内容的准确性和娱乐性都很强
So his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,940
要记住  我们是浪荡子  暗夜之子
Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.

160
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,440
好的   浪荡子  暗夜之子
Great. Lost boys, children of the night.

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,660
明白了
Got it.

162
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,500
能帮忙把小吃递过来吗
Can you pass the chex mix please?

163
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,080
谢谢
Thank you.

164
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,050
我们是浪荡子
We are lost boys.

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,170
是吗
Good for you.

166
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,460
其实我比他更放浪
I'm actually much more lost than he is.

167
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,600
纹身不错
Nice ink.

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,520
谢谢
Thanks.

169
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,180
能请两位小姐喝点东西吗
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

170
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,620
两杯低度啤酒
Two light beers.

171
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,470
低度啤酒吗  "WiliHow"该把这个写进去
Light beers. "Wiki how" about that?

172
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,480
你们叫什么
What's your names?

173
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,980
-我叫霍华德  拉杰  -我是贝萨妮
-I'm Howard. Raj. -I'm Bethany.

174
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,410
很高兴见到你   贝萨妮
Nice to meet you, Bethany.

175
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,580
很高兴
Yes, very nice.

176
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,080
我也是
Nice to meet you, too.

177
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,950
我叫莎拉
I'm Sarah.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,790
反正也没人关心
Not that anyone cares.

179
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,880
两位小姐喜欢看约翰·格里沙姆的小说吗
Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?

180
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,320
这动画片叫什么来着
What's this cartoon called again?

181
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,040
恶魔武士
Oshikuru: Demon samurai.

182
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,690
恶魔武士不是动画片
Demon it's not a cartoon.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,000
是动漫
It'anime.

184
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,310
动漫
Anime.

185
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,070
高中时有个女生叫安娜·梅(Anime和Anna May谐音)
You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May.

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,650
安娜·梅·弗莱彻
Anna May Fletcher.

187
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,710
她天生单鼻孔
She was born with one nostril.

188
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,780
她后来的整鼻手术很失败
Then she had this bad nose job

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,780
最后竟然弄成了三个鼻孔
And basically wound up with three.

190
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,190
你现在经常混在这儿了
You're here a lot now.

191
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,200
我话太多了吗
Oh, am I talking too much?

192
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,310
抱歉  我不说了
I'm sorry. Zip.

193
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,440
谢谢
Thank you.

194
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,780
吃块巧克力吧
Chocolate?

195
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,180
好的
Yes please.

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,540
基姆 你好
Oh. Hey, Kim.

197
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,910
请你稍等一下
You know what,hold on.

198
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,670
我到楼道里去接电话
Let me take this in the hall.

199
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,000
你绝对想不到他们找谁来接替你的工作
You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work.

200
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,010
我知道你在干什么了
Okay, I know what you're doing.

201
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,480
真的吗
Really?

202
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,460
你在用巧克力做正面教法
Yes, you're ung chocolates as positive reinforcement

203
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,930
对你认为良好的行为进行奖励
For what you consider correct behavior.

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,790
真聪明
Very good.

205
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
来块巧克力吗
Chocole?

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,840
我不想要什么巧克力
No, I don't want any chocolate!

207
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,600
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

208
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,600
你不能拿我女朋友当实验鼠一样对待
You can't train my girlfend like a lab rat.

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,500
事实证明  我可以
Actually, it turns out I can.

210
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,440
你不应该这么做
well, you shouldn't.

211
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,570
莱纳德  就是没法让你满意  是吧
There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard?

212
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,790
你不满意
You weren't happy

213
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,780
我之前那样对她
With my previous approach to dealing with her,

214
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,550
所以我决定根据桑代克和B.F.斯金纳的理论
So I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques,

215
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,780
采取操作性条件反射的办法
Building on the works of thorndike and B.F. Skinner.

216
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,330
下周的这个时候
By this time next week,

217
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,720
我相信我能让她从水池里一跃而出
I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool,

218
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,620
用鼻子平衡塑料气球
Balancing a beach ball on her nose

219
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,960
不行  这一套必须打住
No, this has to stop now.

220
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,150
我不是真的建议让她从水池里跳出来
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool.

221
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,060
我以为你该听出了我的"才怪了"
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

222
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,230
咱们不过是调整她个性
We're just tweaking her personality.

223
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,470
用另一种说法  就是把那些粗糙表面磨磨光
Sanding off the rough edges, if you will.

224
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,690
不行  你不能磨佩妮
No. You're not sanding Penny.

225
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,140
你是说不许我使用
Are you saying that I am forbidden

226
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,190
能让改进我们生活的
From applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol

227
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,850
无害的科学有效的正常手段
That will make our lives better?

228
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,850
是的  我不许
Yes. You're forbidden.

229
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,090
坏莱纳德
Bad Leonard.

230
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,840
那你们俩是做什么的
So, what do you guys do?

231
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,140
就是些  哥特东西喽
Oh, you know, goth stuff.

232
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,060
哥特杂志喽  哥特音乐喽
Goth magazines, goth music.

233
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,700
哥特食品喽
Goth food.

234
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,880
什么哥特食品
What's goth food?

235
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,900
呃  黑焦三文鱼?
Uh. Blackened salmon?

236
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,190
不是  我是问你们的工作
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

237
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,910
我们是科学家
Oh, we're scientists.

238
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,300
当然  是黑科学的
Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,210
什么是黑科学
What are the dark sciences?

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,460
我们
We...

241
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,800
我是个天体物理学家
Well, I am an astrophysicist,

242
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,050
很多工作都要在晚上进行
And a lot of that takes place at night.

243
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,040
那时候也有吸血鬼呀
When there are vampires

244
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,930
僵尸呀什么的到处乱跑
And miscellaneous undead out and about.

245
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,710
听起来很酷啊
That sounds really cool.

246
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,650
真的吗  好吧  要是你喜欢宇宙那类的
Does it? Okay. If you like space stuff,

247
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,740
我设计国际太空站的部分呢
I design components for the international space station,

248
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,110
在太空里
Which is in space.

249
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,720
你肯定知道  那里没人能听到你喊叫
Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.

250
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,750
那么  两位女士是做什么的
So, what do you gals do?

251
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,110
我在盖普服装店
I work at the gap.

252
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,230
真的  可真有趣  我曾经去过盖普啊
Really? How about that? I've been to the gap.

253
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,370
我也去过
I've been there, as well.

254
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,400
我喜欢你们那种有小口袋的T恤衫
I like your t-shirts with the little pocket.

255
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,960
我也在那儿上班  反正也没人关心
I work the, too. Not that anyone cares.

256
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,760
这地方真无聊
You know, this place is boring.

257
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,920
可不  咱们去别的地方开心开心吧
Yeah why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?

258
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,020
好啊
Okay.

259
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,470
当然  我们喜欢开心
Sure we like fun.

260
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,940
我们是开心的人
We are fun people.

261
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,260
又黑暗又开心
Dark and fun.

262
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,060
来吧  我知道一个地方你们肯定喜欢
Come on. I know a place you'll really dig.

263
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,260
你带来黑色避孕套吗
Did you bring the black condoms?

264
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,430
就在腰包包里啦
In my fanny pack.

265
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
走吧
Let's go.

266
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,030
现在高兴了
Are you happy now?

267
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,710
没有特别高兴
Not particularly

268
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,670
天啊  她没有吧
My god, she didn't!

269
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,020
她究竟在说什么要这么久
What could she possibly be talking about for so long?

270
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,140
显然  在芝士蛋糕厂做招待
Obviously, waitressing at the cheesecake factory

271
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,730
是个复杂的社会经济性活动
Is a complex socioeconomic activity

272
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,550
而且需要相当多的研究与计划
That requires a great deal of analysis and planning.

273
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,740
才怪了
"bazinga."

274
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,710
知道么  采用
You know, using positive

275
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,080
正面鼓励式方法  我能在一个星期之内
Reinforcement techniques, I could train that behavior

276
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,980
让她改变这个恶习
Out of her in a week.

277
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,250
不
No.

278
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,680
要是你让我用负面鼓励法
If you let me use negative reinforcement,

279
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,980
睡觉前我就能做到
I can get it done before we go to bed.

280
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,490
你不能用水喷她的脸
You're not squirting her in the face with water.

281
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,820
当然不
No, of course not.

282
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,860
我说的是十分轻微的电击法
We're talking very mild electric shocks.

283
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,240
连组织损伤都不会有
No tissue damage whatsoever.

284
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,930
别想了
Forget it.

285
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,210
你不可能告诉我
Oh, come on. You can't tell me

286
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,630
给你打造一个更好的女朋友
That you're not intrigued out the possibility

287
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,530
让你一点都不动心
Of building a better girlfriend.

288
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,940
我没有
I'm not.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,020
佩妮的个性 好的和坏的
Well, and Penny's qualities, both good and bad,

290
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,170
合成了她这个人
Are what make her who she is.

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,730
你是说  比如那个让人无法忍受的尖笑声
You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,190
你就不想希望一个低嗓门的笑声吗
You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

293
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,920
不许你改变佩妮的笑声
You're not changing how Penny laughs.

294
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,960
那才是荒诞呢
No, that would be incongruous.

295
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,460
我打算把她的声音整体降低
I was going to lower the whole voice

296
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,840
到一个令人愉快的音区
To a more pleasing register.

297
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,710
对不起啦  伙计
Ugh. Sorry, guys.

298
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,630
那丫头是个怪物
That girl is freaky.

299
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,530
再说一遍
Come again?

300
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,030
怪物
Freaky.

301
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,120
怪物
Freaky?

302
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,840
怪物
Ah, freaky.

303
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,950
吃块巧克力吧
Have a chocolate.

304
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,820
谢谢
Thank you.

305
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,360
你真打算破坏你的身体
Are you seriously going to damage your body

306
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,330
就为了有可能吊上一个
Just for the possibility you could have cheap sex

307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,210
在酒吧里遇到的马子?
With a strange girl you met in a bar?

308
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,500
当然
Yeah!

309
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,500
你妈妈会怎么说
What is your mother going to say?

310
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,340
她根本看不到那里
She's not going to see it.

311
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,090
她现在量我体温都是放嘴里的
She takes my temperature orally now.

312
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,580
霍华德  你打算要什么样的
What are you going to get, Howard?

313
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,600
我不知道该选
Well, I can't really decide

314
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,180
尖叫魔鬼  骇人小头骨
Between a screaming devil, this mean little skull,

315
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,590
或是青蛙柯米特
Or kermit the frog.

316
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,000
青蛙柯米特
Kermit the frog? You know.

317
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,890
你好  我在霍华德的屁股上
Hi-ho. I'm on Howard's butt.

318
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,360
刺个骇人小头骨
Get the mean little skull,

319
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,450
我会让它笑起来
And I'll see if I can make him smile.

320
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,030
请给我刺一个骇人小头骨
Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

321
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,430
你要什么  拉杰
What are you going to get, Raj?

322
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,820
像我这种运气  肝炎差不多
With my luck, hepatitis.

323
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,490
好了  我们开始
Okay, here we go.

324
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,510
只擦了点酒精棉花
That's just rubbing alcohol.

325
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,410
我知道  但凉凉的
I know, but it was cold.

326
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,120
我在放图案
I'm putting on the stencil.

327
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,920
放完后怎么做
What comes after the stencil

328
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,180
够了  到此为止
Okay, that's it.

329
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,340
不刺针  不痛苦  不纹身
No needle. No pain. No tattoo.

330
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,210
小事一桩而已  你又不是没纹过
What's the big deal? You've done this before.

331
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,180
我没纹过
No, I haven't.

332
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,680
看
Look.

333
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,470
抱歉  我骗了你们
I'm sorry. I'm a fraud.

334
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
他是个骗子
He's a fraud.

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,690
我们都说谎了
We're both frauds.

336
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,810
我不是已经说过了吗
Yeah, I think I covered that.

337
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,090
我是在总结
But I was summing up.

338
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,750
我们不是哥特  我们只是普通人
We're not Goth. We're just...guys.

339
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,700
非常  非常聪明的人
Very, very smart guys.

340
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,650
那你们一直在骗人
So you were totally scamming us?

341
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,320
是的
Yes.

342
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,920
要是你想离开再也不想见到我们
And I wouldn't blame you if you

343
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,340
我也不会怪你
Walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.

344
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,900
除非  这突如其来的坦率
Unless, of course,our bold honesty

345
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,870
给我们增添了无限魅力
Has suddenly made us attractive

346
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,240
怎么样
Huh? Huh? Anything?

347
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,160
我要走了
I'm leaving.

348
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,920
我也要走了  反正也没人关心
I'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.

349
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,030
等回去说起此事时  要编个不一样的结局
When we tell this story, let's end it differently.

350
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,150
你在想什么  是不是还要来一段歌舞
What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?

351
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,570
我弄点热牛奶就进去睡了
Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in.

352
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,740
我相信如果你们打算
I trust if you two are planning on engaging

353
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,330
亲热的话
In amorous activities,

354
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,380
会尽量小声点的
You'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.

355
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,400
当然
Of course.

356
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,580
谢谢
Thank you.

357
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,750
味道真好
Mmm. These are so good.

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,560
难以置信
Unbelievable.

359
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,560
怎么了
What?

360
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,710
我刚在想
I-I was just thinking

361
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,580
我们也该进房睡了
We should probably turn in, too.

362
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,460
我的新床送来了
Well, you know, my new bed got delivered. If you come over

363
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,750
如果你过来把它组装好  就能睡在我那里了
And put it together, you can stay at my place.

364
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,130
是吗  但得花不少时间  而且现在有点晚了
Really? That's a lot of work, and it's kind of late.

365
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,250
但那样我们就不用小声了
Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have tbe quiet.

366
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
我们走
Let's go.

367
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,310
有趣
Interesting.

368
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,610
在修正行为方面  性爱比巧克力更有效
Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior.

369
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,770
不知道有没有人研究过这点
I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.

370
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,390
等等  这个故事怎么样
Okay, wait. How about this?

371
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,590
有四个哥特女孩
We say there were four goth girls.

372
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,510
酒吧里有两个女孩  她们还有两个朋友
The two girls in the club have two friends.

373
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,930
不错  不错
I like it, I like it.

374
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,050
虽然她们是哥特  但她们的味道香吗
Did they smell good despite their goth-like nature?

375
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,980
这有什么关系
What's that got to do with the story?

376
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,720
加上嗅觉的描述  我觉得比较真实
Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.

377
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,720
好吧  她们闻起来香香的
Fine, they smelled good

378
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,220
确实  就像茉莉和金银花
Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle

379
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,110
无所谓
Whatever.

380
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,740
她们手拉手  对我们疯狂的
And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic

381
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,580
做下流动作
Hokey pokey for us.

382
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,420
不不  先让我把故事说完
No, no. Ok, let me just say my story all the way through

383
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,870
你再说你的  然后我们再选
And then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.

384
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,170
抱歉  你继续说
I'm sorry. Go on.

385
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,620
我们去纹了身
Okay. We got tattoos,

386
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,260
-然后四个女孩带我们到她们的住所  -但我们没有纹身
- And then the four girls took us to their place - But we don't have tattoos.E.

387
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,620
万一有人要看纹身  怎么办
What if someone asks to see our tattoos?

388
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,240
我们就说纹在了非常私密的部位
We say they're in a very intimate area.

389
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,760
我们太坏了  不是吗
Oh, we're bad boys, aren't we?

390
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,850
就是  就是
Right, right.

391
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,140
再回头说她们的住所
So, we go back to their place

392
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,770
最后我们六个人倒在热气腾腾的浴缸中
And then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

393
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,190
但我们刚纹了身
But we just got tattos.

394
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,140
我们不怕细菌感染吗
Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?

395
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,760
对  那不要浴缸这段了
True. Okay. Forget the hot tub.

396
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,980
重点是我们都和火辣的哥特女孩亲热
The point is, we each had a ménage with sexy goth girls.

397
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,290
今晚太棒了
What a great night.

398
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,370
是啊
Yeah.

399
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,330
明晚去乡村酒吧碰运气吗
Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night?

400
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,950
也许我们能钓上几个牛仔女孩
Maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,950
很有可能
Could happen.

402
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,280
不知道她们闻起来什么味道
I wonder how they smell.
