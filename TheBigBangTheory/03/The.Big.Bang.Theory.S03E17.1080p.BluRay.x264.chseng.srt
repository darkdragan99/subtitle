1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,020
为什么我总是出力
Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,850
很简单啊
Well, it's very simple.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,950
在我们这群一无所有的破烂科学家当中
In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,390
我负责动脑子
I'm the smart one,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,750
沃罗威茨负责搞笑
Wolowitz is the funny one,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,850
库萨帕里是一个奋力想要融入我们的生活
and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,350
但是以失败告终的可爱的老外
who struggles to understand our ways and fails.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,090
你别无选择  只有肌肉男了
That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,450
再多搬一层  我就肌肉难了
One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,050
来的正好 我要饿死了
Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,620
这个  其实我们没带中国菜回来
Um, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,250
-为什么啊  -淡定 这个更赞
- Why not?  - Don't panic. This is better.

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,750
不是吧 你们不会用食物换了魔豆吧
Oh, no. You didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,390
当然没有
Of course not.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,250
况且严格来说  魔豆也是食物
And technically, magic beans would be food.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,390
虽然吃了它们怪浪费的
Although eating them would be quite a waste,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,750
因为你可以种植它们
since you could plant them,

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,320
然后一夜之间  就会长成一株巨大的豆茎
and overnight, have a giant beanstalk,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,220
足够一个小城市吃的
which would provide enough roughage for a small city.

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,450
其实有时候我根本没听你说话
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,150
只是看着你的下巴一上一下
Sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,320
我们去中餐馆的路上
We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,690
貌似看见了亚当·韦斯特
when we thought we saw Adam West,

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,620
（亚当·韦斯特:《蝙蝠侠》的扮演者）

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,690
所以我们就跟着他走
so we followed him.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,820
谁是亚当·韦斯特
Who's Adam West?

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,020
谁是亚当·韦斯特
Who's Adam West?!

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,320
莱纳德  你们性交之后都聊些什么啊
Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,520
我猜是  "哇塞  4分钟  新纪录啊"
My guess is, "Hey, four minutes! New record!"

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,650
所以我才负责搞笑啊
That's why I'm the funny one.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,120
反正呢  我们跟着他到了旧货出售摊儿
Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale,

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,690
那卖的东西都超赞
and they had the coolest stuff.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,790
他们正好关门大甩卖
They were closing up.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,650
这一箱子东西才60块
We got this whole box for 60 bucks.

35
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,050
我们还没来得及看清都有什么呢
We didn't even get to go through it all.

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,350
说不定有什么宝贝呢
There could be anything in here.

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,120
看看有没有新女朋友 说不定你需要一个
There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,950
没有
No.

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,320
不过有《捉鬼敢死队》的原版终稿
But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,050
上面真的有黏液的污迹哎
with actual slime stains!

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,550
你说得对
Oh, you're right.

42
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,790
这个是《捉鬼敢死队2》
It's Ghostbusters 2.

43
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,050
没看头
Never mind.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
我滴神啊
Oh, my God.

45
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,030
是阿福娃娃
An Alf doll.

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,380
我11岁时  我妈在我爸去世后
When I was 11, my mother got me one

47
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,660
给我买了一个 让我能睡好觉
to help me sleep after my dad left.

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,900
我那时候会假装 爸爸是去了蜜胺树脂星球
I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac,

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,330
而阿福会把他带回我身边的
and Alf was going to bring him back to me.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,630
但它从来也没有
But he never did.

51
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,860
我爸爸在哪儿  小玩偶
Where's my daddy, puppet?

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,500
他在哪儿
Where is he?

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
太伤感了
That is so sad.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,560
不  更伤感的是你居然不知道
No, what's sad is that you don't know

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,530
亚当·韦斯特是电视版蝙蝠侠的扮演者
Adam West was TV's Batman.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
生活大爆炸第三季第十七集

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,030
史波克的脑袋(波克:《星际迷航》中的人物)
Here's Spock's head with no body.

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,700
T先生的身子(Mr.T:《星际迷航》中的人物)
Here's Mr.T's body with no head.

59
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
啊在这儿  史波克的身子配T先生的脑袋
Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body with Mr.T's head.

60
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,970
我同情那些没有逻辑的傻瓜
I pity the fool who's illogical.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,930
好吧  我要回家了
Okay, I'm just gonna go home

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,830
做一个烤干酪  然后上eHarmony 意淫去
and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.

63
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,830
（eHarmony:美国线上交友网站）

64
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,700
好的  拜拜
Okay, bye.

65
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,300
妥了
Okay.

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,730
哇塞  快看  《夺宝奇兵》的连连看
Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.

67
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,900
还有潜水侠的手办
And an Aquaman action figure.

68
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,200
好像有人给他画了个小弟弟
Looks like someone drew a penis on him.

69
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,400
没事儿  看我擦掉
Ooh, that'll come off.

70
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,600
我们都看不下去了喂
You see what you're doing?

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,070
停下
Stop that.

72
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,330
真赞啊
Fascinating.

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,770
什么东西
What?

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
是《魔戒》里的魔戒
It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.

75
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,700
上面居然还刻着
Oh. It's even got

76
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,270
精灵语呢
the Elvish engraving on it.

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
不是精灵语
It's not Elvish.

78
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,830
是用精灵语的字母写的魔多语
It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script.

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,000
"魔戒全属至尊御"
"One Ring to rule them all."
（出自《魔戒》台词）

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
"至尊指引诸魔戒"
"One Ring to find them."

81
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,200
"至尊魔戒唤众戒"
"One Ring to bring them all."

82
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,730
"众戒归一黑暗中"
"And in the darkness bind them."

83
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,700
我靠  咱们好宅啊
Holy crap, are we nerdy.

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,030
我调查了一下这个魔戒
So, I was doing some checking on the ring.

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,270
等下  谢尔顿  那边桌子上的是番茄酱吗
Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,530
是滴
Yes, there is.

87
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,100
有个好玩的事儿 起初 番茄酱是酱汁的总称
Oh, here's a fun fact. Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce,

88
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,400
特别是那些加了草本植物和香料的 蘑菇或腌鱼
typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices.

89
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,130
早期流行的主材料包括蓝莓
Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry,

90
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,630
凤尾鱼  牡蛎  四季豆  还有葡萄
anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,600
没事儿  我去拿
No, that's okay. I'll get it.

92
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,200
听我说  我仔细观察了魔戒 看上去有点奇怪
Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird.

93
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,770
上面竟然没有版权声明
No copyright notice on it.

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,300
所以我就拿给我一个哥们儿看  这么说吧
So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with--

95
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,900
他专门和收藏界的黑市 做交易
shall we say-- the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.

96
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,370
黑市
Seedy underbelly?

97
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,730
你那个黑市淘来的手提式相位枪
You know, your black market phasers,

98
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,770
（出自《星际迷航》）

99
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,900
还有乌拉中尉在电影中穿过的内裤
your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties,

100
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,270
就那些东西呗
that kind of stuff.

101
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,470
你这个神秘兄弟是谁
Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,530
就是我认识的一个家伙
Just a guy. I know a guy.

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,230
-艾迪·克里斯波吗  -我不能告诉你  别问了
- Is it Eddie Crispo? - No, I can't tell you who it is. Stop asking.

104
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,870
还能是谁  肯定是艾迪·克里斯波
Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.

105
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,970
我认识很多黑道人物  好不好
I know lots of dangerous people, okay?

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,030
-说一个  -艾迪·克里斯波
- Name one. - Eddie Crispo.

107
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,170
不管怎样 他说这个不是仿品 而是真品
Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,130
如果你说这就是索伦在末日火山
If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power

109
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,400
打造的至尊魔戒[指环王情节]
forged by Sauron in Mount Doom,

110
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,830
我会用极为不屑和
I look at you with an expression of exhaustion

111
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,870
嘲笑的表情看着你
and ever so slight amusement.

112
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,830
他不是说这是魔戒
He's not saying it's a magic ring.

113
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,770
对吧
You're not, are you?

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
没错  但差不多
No, but it's close.

115
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,300
看里面的标记
Look at the markings inside.

116
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,600
那是生产标记
Those are production markings.

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,570
为拍摄《指环王》  共打造了九枚戒指
Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies.

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
三枚送给了剧中演员
Three were given to members of the cast.

119
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,870
剩下的都被销毁了
The rest were destroyed.

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,630
除了一枚
Except one.

121
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,370
被偷的一枚
One was stolen.

122
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,430
先生们
Gentlemen...

123
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,000
这就是至尊魔戒
this is the one ring.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,830
归我了
Mine!

125
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,430
不  不是你的
No, it is not yours.

126
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,070
我们一起去要的箱子
We all went in on the box together.

127
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,400
对  但是我在箱子里找到的
Well, yes, but I found it in the box,

128
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,500
海难救助法明确规定
and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state

129
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,400
找到沉海宝藏的人
that the finder of a sunken treasure

130
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,000
即视为宝藏的主人
is the owner of the treasure.

131
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,900
这怎么符合海难救助法
How is this maritime salvage?

132
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,330
除了没有水  怎么不符合
Other than the lack of water, how is it not?

133
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,870
等等  谢尔顿  先别发疯
Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second.

134
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,070
这种东西值多少钱
How much is something like this worth?

135
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,700
这么抢手的东西很难估价
Well, it's tough to say since it's hot,

136
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,800
不过在黑市里  我朋友估价
but on the underground market, my guy figures...

137
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,830
你是指艾迪·克里斯波吧
Your guy Eddie Crispo?

138
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,030
是滴
Yes.

139
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,900
他估价一万到一万五
He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.

140
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,400
既然值这么多钱
Okay, that's a lot of money.

141
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,530
明智之举是用它投资更实用的东西
The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical.

142
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,270
比如水上摩托艇
Like a jet ski.

143
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,230
你要摩托艇干嘛
Why do you want a jet ski?

144
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,570
电影里有钱又帅的人都骑摩托艇
All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,370
这不可能是巧合
That can't just be a coincidence.

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
我们不能卖它
We can't sell it.

147
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,070
要保存它
We have to keep it

148
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
珍惜它  爱护它
and love it and polish it,

149
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,870
只能偶尔拿出来
and only take it out occasionally

150
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,200
去公园里
when we go to the park

151
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,200
重演电影里喜欢的场景
and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies.

152
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,270
听着有意思  其实很无聊
It's sad how great that sounds.

153
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,470
各位  这是偷来的
Guys, it's stolen.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,100
应该还给彼得·杰克逊[指环王导演]
It should go back to Peter Jackson.

155
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,930
他制作的电影  魔戒应该属于他
He made the movies; it belongs to him.

156
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,130
行啊
Fine.

157
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,500
可以换给他  只要他答应
He can have it back as long as he promises

158
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,770
让我演下一部电影里的霍比特人
to make me a hobbit in his next movie.

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,870
没有犹太霍比特人
There are no Jewish hobbits.

160
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,730
显然你没在岁首节[犹太新年]
Clearly, you've never been to my house

161
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,000
来我家吃饭
for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

162
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,400
我们不能敲诈彼得·杰
We are not blackmailing Peter J...

163
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,900
够了  魔戒哪去了
All right, where's the ring?

164
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,200
你是说我的魔戒吗
You mean my ring?

165
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,300
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

166
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,470
魔戒无人看护
The ring was unguarded.

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,230
就这么放着台面
It was just sitting on the table.

168
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,700
谁都能拿走
Anyone could have taken it.

169
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,630
证据  我拿了
Proof? I did.

170
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,200
-给我  -大家理智点
- Give me that. - Look, let's be reasonable.

171
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,570
我们都对魔戒抱有不同的想法
We all want to do different things with the ring,

172
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,500
但你们的想法太傻  我要的可是摩托艇
but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.

173
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,230
我找到的  魔戒是我的
I found it. The ring is mine.

174
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,570
我不明白  为啥每次都不能我说了算
I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.

175
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,130
有哪次不是你说了算
You always get your way.

176
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,430
你把魔戒给我  才是每次我说了算
I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.

177
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,600
各位
Hey, guys.

178
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,970
喜欢我给你们上的
Enjoying your food that I actually

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,630
不是你们点的菜
brought you instead of promising food,

180
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,770
是我随意找的一堆垃圾
but bringing you a box of random crap?

181
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,900
很好吃
Yeah, it's delicious.

182
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,730
就是讽刺的话不太新鲜
The sarcasm's a little stale, though.

183
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,030
要不这样吧
Hey, how about this?

184
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,900
确定如何处理魔戒前
Until we figure out what to do with the ring,

185
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,070
由佩妮来保管
Penny holds on to it.

186
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,970
什么戒指
What ring?

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,130
这枚戒指
This ring.

188
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,300
在找东西吗
Looking for something?

189
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,830
你能保管几天吗
Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?

190
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,470
-为什么  -这是部电影的道具
- Why? - It's a prop from a movie,

191
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,430
我们正为此争吵呢
And we're kind of fighting over it.

192
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,130
只想说清楚  我男朋友给我的
Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewelry

193
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,870
第一件珠宝是电影里的道具
my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie,

194
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,370
而且我还不能拥有它
and I don't even get to keep it?

195
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,070
如果你三年前跟了我
If you had gone out with me three years ago,

196
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,500
你现在应该能收到我姑婆艾达
by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch

197
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,070
塞进猫肚子从德占比利时偷运出的胸针
that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,370
现在感觉我还好吧
How am I looking now?

199
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,330
你打我
You hit me!

200
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,530
我在流血
I'm bleeding!

201
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,230
什么情况
What was that?

202
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,500
谢尔顿想偷魔戒  我给了他一拳
Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.

203
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
干得好
That's my girl.

204
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,000
谢尔顿啊
So, Sheldon,

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,160
被一个女人家揍的感觉如何
how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?

206
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,960
反正不是第一次了
It's not the first time.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,400
在子宫里我那胞姐就开始欺负我
I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero.

208
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,530
如果当年我能一直坚定的吸收掉她
If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her,

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
我也就多了一颗长毛的痣
then I'd have a mole with hair in it

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
这样也不会收到那些无聊的圣诞贺卡了
instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.

211
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,930
先生们  你们还没有觉悟吗
Gentlemen, have you come to the realization

212
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,770
最明智的选择
that the only reasonable course of action

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,570
就是卖了魔戒再分钱
is to sell the ring and divide the money?

214
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,730
没门
No.

215
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,800
我就怕你这么说
I was afraid of that.

216
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,800
说吧
Go ahead.

217
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,430
在孟买问候大家
Greetings from Mumbai.

218
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,930
我是拉杰的律师  文卡塔斯·库萨帕里
I am Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.

219
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,970
也是我表哥
Also my cousin.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,430
你居然还找了个律师
You brought a lawyer?

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,670
这个不用回答
Don't answer that.

222
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,830
我就直说了
I'll get straight to the point.

223
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,870
我的委托人准备放弃
My client's prepared to surrender

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,330
他在这枚魔戒上的一切利益
any interest he has in the ring

225
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,070
来交换两辆川崎水上摩托
in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.

226
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,100
两辆水上摩托是不可能的
We're not giving him two Jet Skis.

227
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,530
听着  大家都成年人了
Look, we're big boys,

228
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,230
我们何不都退一步海阔天空呢
why don't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle?

229
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,670
一辆水上摩托就够了 怎么样
One Kawasaki Jet Ski. Done and done.

230
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,300
半辆都不给
No Jet Skis.

231
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,730
好吧  不谈水上摩托了
All right, forget the Jet Skis.

232
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,500
你说什么 这是我们的底线
Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand!

233
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,400
你就这点招数吗
What happened to "tear them a new one?"

234
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,230
那你要我怎样 他们态度强硬 我们输了
What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.

235
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,570
你这没用的东西
You're useless.

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
你来雇我时我就说了
I told you that when you hired me.

237
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,870
我要下线了
I'm signing off now.

238
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,030
记得联系你妈 她担心你呢
Call your mother. She worries.

239
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,210
知道吗 向别人介绍自己的律师表兄时
Okay, just so you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers,

240
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,900
要准备好被雷
prepare for shock and awe.

241
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,280
告诉你们  我来了结这件事
You know what? I am ending this.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,590
佩妮不想再保管魔戒
Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore.

243
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,460
她还给了我  现在我手上 我要寄回去
She gave it to me. I have it. I'm sending it back.

244
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,190
魔戒呢
Where's the ring?

245
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,660
你是指这个魔戒吗
You mean this ring?

246
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,460
下次在公共厕所里排尿
Next time be aware of your surroundings

247
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,660
记得要耳听八方环顾四周
while urinating in a public men's room.

248
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,860
快给我
Give me that.

249
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,890
才不  这是我的
No, it's mine.

250
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,830
我们都有份
It's all of ours.

251
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,830
-得了  这也太荒唐了  -那就放手
- Okay, now, this is ridiculous!  - Then let go!

252
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,190
偏不  你干嘛不放手
I'm not letting go. You let go.

253
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,660
要我说  谁坚持到最后
I say this ring belongs

254
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,730
魔戒就归谁
to the last person who can hold on.

255
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,930
行啊  我们回家再开始吗
Fine. But can't we go home and start this?

256
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,460
当然 那现在先放手
Sure. Let go of the ring.

257
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,990
好吧  那就从现在开始
All right, it starts now.

258
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,890
今晚科幻频道有巨虫电影联播
You do realize there's a giant bug movie marathon

259
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,160
你们都还记得吧
tonight on the Syfy Channel.

260
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,960
慢  我的笔记本还没拿
Wait, my laptop.

261
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,560
这也太白痴了  一点也没意义了
You know, there's a point no when this becomes idiotic.

262
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,830
刚我们这样开车的时候你咋不说
And it wasn't when we were driving like this?

263
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,060
我好心建议你们三个放弃吧
I would advise the three of you

264
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,690
再怎么死撑也是徒劳
that resistance is futile.

265
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,360
我的耐性可是出了名的好
I have endless patience.

266
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,590
我曾和惠普的客服人员
I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold

267
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,590
耗了整整两个半小时
with Hewlett-Packard customer service

268
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,760
就为投诉他们客服态度差劲
just to complain about their customer service.

269
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
你少和我吹嘘耐性
You want to talk about endless patience?

270
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,290
佩妮逼我看完了整整
Penny made me watch all five seasons

271
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,460
五季的《欲望都市》
of Sex and the City.

272
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,560
老兄  那玩意有六季
There are six seasons, dude.

273
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,730
噢  杯具
Oh, crap!

274
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,230
别这么说嘛  第六季很赞啊
No, no, no, the sixth season is great.

275
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,290
凯莉刚分手  伤心地去了巴黎
We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken,

276
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,530
而大人物又突然出现
and then Mr. Big shows up,

277
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,530
我们都很好奇  她是否还能再相信他
we don't know if we can trust him again.

278
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,730
真是跨越地球的爱恋啊
It's a wild ride.

279
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,760
我要开门
Door.

280
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,990
同志们  屈膝[法语 芭蕾舞动作]
Okay, everybody, and plie?

281
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,190
再踮立[法语 芭蕾舞动作]
And releve?

282
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,160
你们干什么呢
Whatcha doin'?

283
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,930
谁坚持到最后  魔戒归谁
Last one holding the ring decides its fate.

284
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,160
我知道这很蠢
I know, it sounds silly.

285
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,090
才不会呢  你是我男友啊
No, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend.

286
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,130
情人眼里出西施嘛
Nothing you do is silly to me.

287
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,060
多谢
Thank you.

288
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,860

老子不干了
I'm out.

290
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,530
抱歉  老妈

没办法  我要在办公室加班
I have to stay late at the office.

292
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,860
才没有  他在骗你
No, he's doesn't! He's lying to you!

293
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,660
你就不能消停点吗
Will you be quiet?

294
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,530
要隐私的话  放开手就行了啊
Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring.

295
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
真开心
I'm so glad

296
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,190
终于能来这家异教徒的脱衣舞俱乐部

297
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,430
霍华德

再给你个培根  塞她们丁字裤里去
here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's G-string!

299
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,630
我再打给你
I'll call you back.

300
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,690
你实在太贴心了  还特地打电话
I think it's lovely you call your mommy

301
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,530
告诉你妈  你赶不回去吃晚饭
and let her know you're going to be late for dinner.

302
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,790
据我所知
From what I know about these things,

303
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,660
没能按时喂奶的女人
if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time,

304
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,530
咪咪会很不舒服的
it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.

305
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,590
别跟我谈我妈的咪咪
Don't you talk about my mother's boobies!

306
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,230
听着不爽的话  放手啊
If you're offended, let go of the ring

307
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,760
赶紧回家找你妈吃奶去
and go on home to your mother's boobies.

308
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,330
太好了  太好了
Excellent, excellent.

309
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,130
你们俩耗吧  我就能笑到最后
Tire each other out, the ring will be mine.

310
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,890
霍华德  何不谈谈拉杰他妈
Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?

311
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,390
不然咱谈谈你妈
Why don't we go after your mother?

312
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,360
尽管谈
Go ahead.

313
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,490
我又没有恋母情结
I have no illusions about my mother.

314
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,460
她就一个和蔼可亲
She is a kind, loving,

315

笃信上帝  极端右翼的德州人

还对佩珀汽水有点上瘾
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

318
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,330
还有什么要补充的吗
Anything you'd like to add?

319
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
这样说根本没用
That's not gonna get you anywhere.

320
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,860
得给他来点狠的
Better pull out the big gun.

321
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,860
说得对
You're right.

322
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,090
咱来谈谈你祖母
Let's talk about your grandmother.

323
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,860
不要
No!

324
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,430
不许说我奶奶
I call no Meemaws.

325
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,890
想想看
Think about this.

326
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,390
你奶奶肯定得跟人上床  才会有你妈
The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.

327
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,760
我不想听这些
I don't want to hear this.

328
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,190
那就放手  走一边去
Then let go of the ring and walk away.

329
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,630
想都别想
Never.

330
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,830
好吧
All right.

331
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,030
我敢说  你奶奶
I'll bet your Meemaw

332
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,490
不仅仅是为了传宗接代才跟人上床的
didn't just have sex to have your mother.

333
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,130
我敢说  她肯定也享受性爱
I bet she had sex because she liked it.

334
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,860
别说了
Stop it!

335
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,590
对  奶奶也并不圣洁
Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.

336
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,390
我叫你们闭嘴
I said stop it!

337
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,230

343
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,430
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

344
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,660
潜意识信息
Subliminal messaging.

345
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,930
通过这让你们产生尿意
I'm going to make you want to pee.

346
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,730
滴水的水龙头
Dripping faucets.

347

漏水的水槽
Leaky gutter.

348
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,630
尿尿
Peeing.

349
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,360
这招根本不管用  伙计
It's, it's not working, dude.

350
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,430
已经管用了
Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right.

351
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,730
我想上厕所
I have to pee.

352
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,560
那就放开魔戒去啊
Then let go of the ring and go.

353
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,030
其实  我也想上了
No, actually, I wouldn't mind going, too.

354
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,560
好吧
Fine.

355
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,930
数到三

一  二
One, two...

357
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,590
等等  先说清楚
Wait, just to clarify.

358
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,660
数到三  是都站起来还是直接尿尿
When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?

359
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,960
都站起来
We stand up.

360
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,590
明智之选
Excellent choice.

361
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,760
三
Three.

362
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,590
我有预感
Something tells me

363
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,260
今天真不该穿绒面革皮鞋的
this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.

364
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,160

我赢了
I've won!

366
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,430
魔戒是我的了

是我的了
It's mine!

368
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,360
得彻底清洗下  让它更漂亮
We're going to clean it up and make it pretty.

369
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,860
是我的
My own.

370
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,830
我亲爱的

371

（谢尔顿华丽变身《魔戒》中的咕噜[Gollum]）

魔戒呢
Where's the ring?

374
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,360
在联邦快递的盒子里  回它原来的地方去了
It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.

本就不是我们的
It wasn't ours.

378
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,860
你早就退出了比赛
You quit the game!

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,260
根本没资格拿走魔戒
You had no right to take it.

380
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,860
我走进来的时候  你们都睡着了
I came in here, you guys were all sleeping.

381
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,790
魔戒掉在地板上  没人拿着
The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.

382
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,360
那就该重新开始  直到产生最后的赢家
Well, so then we start the game over until there's a winner.

383
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,730
根本不会有什么赢家
There wasn't ever going to be a winner.

384
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,190
只会有一个手握魔戒的自私鬼

真想的话  随便吧
'Cause if it is, fine.
