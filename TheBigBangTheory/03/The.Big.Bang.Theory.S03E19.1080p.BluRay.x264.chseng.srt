1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,830
喘不过气了吗
Having a little trouble catching your breath there?

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,830
不  不  我没事儿
No, no, I'm good.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,650
要是体育老师早告诉我刻苦训练是为了这个
If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for,

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,360
我就会试着再努力点
I would have tried a lot harder.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,060
要么去做  要么放手  没有尝试一说
"Do or do not. There is no try."

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,830
你刚引用了星战的台词吗
Did you just quote star wars?

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,130
我引用的应该是《帝国反击战》的台词
I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,900
（[星战第五部]）

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,200
老天爷
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,960
我居然和一个能引用尤达大师的话的美女躺在一起
I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,500
（[尤达：星战人物]）

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,460
我爱你  佩妮
I love you, Penny.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
谢谢
Thank you.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,700
不客气
You're welcome.

15
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,290
我只是不吐不快而已
I just wanted to put that out there.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,620
不  我很高兴
Oh, yeah, no, I-I'm-I'm glad.

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,890
那就好
Good.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,730
-高兴就好  -嗯
- Glad is good.  - Yeah.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,660
没手表
No, no...

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,690
呃...已经很晚了
So, it's getting pretty late.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,690
-我们差不多该睡觉吧  -对
- We should probably go to sleep.  - Yeah.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,190
-对  -该睡了
- Okay.  - Yeah, probably.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,800
-晚安  亲爱的  -晚安
- Okay, good night, sweetie.  - Good night.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
生活大爆炸第三季第十九集

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,500
莱纳德  你对巨型蚂蚁这个问题持什么立场
Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?

26
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,830
谢尔顿说不可能有
Sheldon says impossible.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
霍华德和我都觉得不仅可能
Howard and I say not only possible,

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,570
而且作为一种交通工具  比蝙蝠战车酷多了
but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.

29
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,940
（[蝙蝠战车：蝙蝠侠的座驾]）

30
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,320
你忽视了平方/立方定律
You are ignoring the square-cube law.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,700
巨型蚂蚁会被 自身的骨骼重量压垮
The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,890
而且准确来说
And for the record,

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,560
真正酷的交通工具排名应该是
the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is:

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,090
（[悬滑板引自《回到未来2》  传送器引自《星际迷航》]）
喷射背包  悬滑板  传送器  蝙蝠战车 然后才是巨型蚂蚁
jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,860
有没有搞错 你们就没别的事干
Seriously? You have nothing better to do

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,260
只能坐在这里聊巨型蚂蚁存在的可能性吗
than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,660
他怎么了
What's with him?

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,660
估计他到了每月一次的敏感期了
Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.

39
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,690
你是说他来大姨夫了[与Menstruating同音]
Are you saying he's man-strating?

40
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,460
不是字面意义上的
Not literally.

41
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,960
但早在十七世纪
But as far back as the 17th century,

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,630
科学家就发现男性荷尔蒙水平 有个33天的波动周期
scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,850
有意思
Interesting.

44
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,220
难怪我每月中旬都会两眼泪汪汪
That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month.

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,590
你知道我在说什么
You know what I'm talking about.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,890
（[潜台词: 别说得这么暧昧...]）

47
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,030
算了  不说巨型蚂蚁
Okay, forget giant ants.

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,830
巨型兔子呢
How about giant rabbits?

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,960
不管大小  我都不喜欢兔子
Big or small, I don't like rabbits.

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,660
兔子总是看似很想说话
They always look like they're about to say something,

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,230
但从来不开口
but they never do.

52
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,360
兔子倒是有呼吸系统 支撑巨大的体型
Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,930
并且  兔子是少数哺乳动物中
And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals

54
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,790
阴囊长在阴茎前的
whose scrotum is in front of the penis.

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,290
也许这才是他们想谈论的
Maybe that's what they want to talk about.

56
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,260
莱纳德  你对巨型兔子和阴囊位置 持啥态度
Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,530
我一点都不在乎
I honestly don't care.

58
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,330
是吗
Really?

59
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
每次我们谈到不寻常的动物生殖器
Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals,

60
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,930
你总会有些有力且富争议性的观点
you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.

61
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,430
你想让我说什么 我就是对这个没兴趣
What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass.

62
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,030
有没有巨型老鼠屁屁
Would that be a giant rat's ass?

63
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,000
准确来说  巨型老鼠是有可能存在的
For the record, giant rats are possible.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,030
我们能不能说点别的
Can we please talk about something else?

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,930
比如稍微跟我们生活有关 而且是地球上的东西
Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?

66
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,930
这个话题怎么样
Okay, how about this for a topic:

67
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,960
为什么莱纳德是个大混蛋
Why is Leonard being a giant douche?

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,260
假设大混蛋有可能存在
Assuming giant douches are possible.

69
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
当然有
Of course they are.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
莱纳德就是一个
Leonard's being one.

71
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,030
说不定他和佩妮发生了"爱爱"口角
Maybe he's having a lover's spat with Penny.

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,660
才怪  我们没吵架
No, there was no spat.

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,560
但确实发生了点状况
Oh, but something happened.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
我不想谈这个
I don't want to talk about it.

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,430
我觉得你想说  我不想听 失陪
But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it. Excuse me.

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,400
你干啥了  罗密欧
What'd you do, Romeo?

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,430
往身上倒枫蜜
You pour maple syrup all over your body

78
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,630
问她有没有性致玩3P
and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?

79
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,180
你是不是穿她的内裤跳来跳去取悦她
Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around,

80
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,130
结果却把她吓着了
but it wound up just creeping her out?

81
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,330
什么  没有
What? No.

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,830
我只是问问  老兄
I'm just asking, dude.

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,630
没准儿呢[Raj深受其害]
It happens.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,800
你们参加今晚的保龄球赛吗
You guys still on for bowling tonight?

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
当然参加
Oh, yes.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
我还准备了几句垃圾话呢
In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
你打得跟你妈一个水准
You bowl like your mama.

88
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,800
不过  如果她打得很好
Unless, of course, she bowls well.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
那就是  你打得跟你妈大相径庭
In which case, you bowl nothing like her.

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
哦  唉哟
Oh. Ouch.

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,200
这就是灼烈言辞的效果
That is what is referred to as a burn on you.

92
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,960
你要求她滴蜡吗
Did you ask her to start waxing?

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,930
没有
No.

94
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,900
你滴蜡了
Did you start waxing?

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,030
没有
No.

96
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,700
是不是做爱时
While making love,

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,200
你不小心拍了自己屁股  然后大声哭喊"妈咪"
did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out, "Mommy"?

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
我懒得理你们
I'm walking away from you now.

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
他没否定哎
That wasn't a no.

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,900
看来我们猜得越来越靠谱儿了
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

101
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
你是在跟她上床的时候
Did you take a Benadryl

102
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
吃了片苯海拉明(此药会造成昏昏欲睡)然后睡着了么
and fall asleep while pleasuring her?

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,430
你可能会因此丢了小命儿哎
Because you can die that way.

104
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,000
牡丹花下死  做鬼也风流啊
Oh, that would be a good way to go.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,200
-嗨  -嗨
- Hi.  - Oh, hey.

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,130
太好了  佩妮 友情提示  今晚7点  保龄之夜
Good, Penny. Reminder: bowling tonight at 7:00.

107
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,130
噢对  保龄
Oh, right, bowling.

108
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,360
你要是不想来也不用勉强
You don't have to come if you don't want to.

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,860
不会啊  没那回事儿
No, no, it's okay.

110
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,500
说实话  没我的话你们指定输得巨惨
I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,860
确实
We would indeed.

112
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,300
就此特殊情况来看
In this particular case,

113
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,460
你纯爷们儿的气质对我们十分有利
your lack of femininity works to our advantage.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,260
跟你聊天总是这么开心  谢尔顿
It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.

115
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,200
是讽刺吗
Sarcasm?

116
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
是毫不掩饰的轻视你
Thinly veiled contempt.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,730
-别忘了  7点  -知道啦
- Remember: 7:00.  - Got it.

118
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,200
-是太平洋夏令时  -咋着吧
- Pacific Daylight time! - Bite me!

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,260
请把这纯爷们儿的气场发挥在赛场上吧
Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.

120
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,700
你不是要带自己的保龄球鞋来吗
I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.

121
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,800
这双就是我自己的啊
These are my own bowling shoes.

122
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,160
那你还消什么毒啊
Then what's with the disinfectant?

123
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,830
我脚踩过啥地方我知道
I know where my feet have been.

124
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,260
嗨  佩妮
Hey, Penny!

125
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,400
还有各位路人
And you guys.

126
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,830
阿尔比诺·鲍勃不能来了 所以我带了个替补来
Albino Bob couldn't make it, so I brought a substitute.

127
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,900
相信你们中有人认识他 威尔·惠顿 (《星际迷航》中的演员)
I believe some of you know wil Wheaton.

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,700
嗨  谢尔顿  近来如何啊
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

129
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,860
哎哟哟 这不是威尔·惠顿嘛
Well, well, well. If it isn't Wil Wheaton,

130
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,730
我家蜘蛛侠的敌人  绿魔
the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man.

131
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,830
我家伽利略的对头  教皇保罗五世
the Pope Paul V to my Galileo,

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,960
我家火狐的对手  IE浏览器
the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,600
我上次纸牌锦标赛赢了你 你不会还怀恨在心呢吧
You're not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,530
我可是"臭威尔惠顿" 企业网站  互联网站和机构网站的所有人
I'm the proud owner of wilwheatonstinks.com, .net, and .org.

135
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,900
知道这说明什么吗
What does that tell you?

136
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,000
这说明你无时无刻都在想着我
It tells me that I am living rent-free right here.

137
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,160
准备好比赛了么
You ready to bowl?

138
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,630
当然准备好了
Oh, I'm ready.

139
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,460
我不知道斯图尔特有没有告诉你 今晚你的对手是谁
I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against tonight,

140
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,000
不过站在你面前的人就是
but before you stands the co-captain of the

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,330
东德克萨斯州青年基督徒圣保龄同盟会 冠军队的联盟队长
East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team.

142
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,560
7到12岁参赛组
Seven- to 12-year-old division.

143
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,060
佩妮打得也不错
Also, Penny's pretty good.

144
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,560
很好  那放马来吧
Great. Then it's on.

145
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,900
愚蠢的威尔·惠顿  战火就没灭过
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.

146
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,730
好的
Yes!

147
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,060
常见的补中
A common spare.

148
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,300
保龄赛会上的"特工佳丽"
The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant.

149
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,900
在你登陆推特
Before you jump on Twitter

150
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,830
然后吹嘘自己那可以无视的成就之前
to tout your modest accomplishment,

151
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,000
看看什么叫真正的高手
watch how it's really done.

152
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,860
吾乃此球
I am the ball.

153
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,460
吾念乃其念
My thoughts are its thoughts.

154
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,300
其洞乃吾洞
Its holes are my holes.

155
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,800
好的
Yes.

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,230
推特这个吧  推特鸟
Tweet that, Tweety Bird.

157
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,100
我只想跟你说 我是你的粉丝
Hey, I just wanted to tell you i'm a big fan.

158
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,530
谢了
Oh, thanks.

159
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,660
你肯定被《星际迷航》的问题问得想吐了
I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions,

160
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,930
不过乌比·戈德堡  你有没那个啊
but Whoopi Goldberg-- you ever hit that?

161
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,730
啤酒啊
Ah, beer.

162
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,130
能让这个可怜害羞的印度男孩
The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy

163
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,200
成为耀眼人物的神奇药剂
into the life of the party.

164
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,260
好耶
Oh, yeah.

165
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,360
吃辣味奶酪薯条吗
Chili cheese fry?

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,960
好啊  我爱辣味奶酪薯条
Yes. I love chili cheese fries.

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,530
真的  你爱吃啊
Really? You love them?

168
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,520
是啊  怎么了
Yeah, why?

169
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,830
没事啊  只是很高兴听到 你对表达爱意毫无障碍
No reason. I'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something.

170
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,930
你真的想现在谈这事儿吗
Do you really want to get into this right now?

171
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,000
谈啥事儿
Get into what?

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,100
你怎么会不爱吃辣味奶酪薯条呢
Why wouldn't you love the chili cheese fries?

173
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,230
这么多年你一直都在吃
They've been in your life a long time.

174
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,530
它们让你心情大好  它们应该知道你对它们的爱
They make you happy. They deserve to know.

175
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,380
昨晚我只是被你吓到了  我不知道说什么好
Look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn't know what to say.

176
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,530
好  到现在给你的思考时间够久了吧
Okay, well, now you've had some time to think about it.

177
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,800
那你想说什么
So, what do you want to say?

178
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,930
我不确定
I'm not sure.

179
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,100
你怎么会不确定
How can you not be sure?

180
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,460
在这谈论这事儿不太合适
Okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation.

181
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,300
对啊  合适的地方是在床上
No, the place to have the conversation was in bed

182
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,630
在我说了"我爱你"
after I said, "I love you"

183
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,630
你说"谢谢  晚安"之后
and you said, "Thank you. Good night."

184
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,620
别逼我  莱纳德
Don't push it, Leonard.

185
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,700
-我没逼你  -你逼我了
- I am not pushing anything.  - You are.

186
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,930
你没权利决定我什么时候准备好说"我爱你"
You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say "I love you!"

187
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,030
原来是过早的告白问题
Ah, the premature "I love you."

188
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,030
我猜的是过"早"的问题  算对吗
I guessed "premature." Does that count?

189
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,040
佩妮
Penny.

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,740
佩妮
Penny.

191
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,740
佩妮
Penny.

192
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,230
干嘛
What?

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,200
给你的
This is for you.

194
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,860
冰淇淋
Ice cream?

195
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,030
我通过研读连环画《凯西》[一部讲述女人生活的漫画]
I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises.

196
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,100
努力想要熟悉雌性生物的感情危机
by studying the comic strip Cathy.

197
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,200
她一沮丧就会说"日"  然后吃冰淇淋
When she's upset, she says, "Ack!" and eats ice cream.

198
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,470
日啊
Ack!

199
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,340
你要是只猫  我就给你带千层面了
If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.

200
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,000
是莱纳德让你来的吗
Did Leonard send you over here?

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,720
不  自从你昨晚突然离开 我们还没说过话
No, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
害得我们昨天输给斯图尔特和他那卑鄙的参赛者威尔·惠顿
caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.

203
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,710
为此我很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

204
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,360
我毫不自豪地承认昨天我是哭着睡着的
I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.

205
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,140
再次说声抱歉
Again, I'm sorry.

206
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,560
让我来告诉你吧
And let me tell you, sleep did not

207
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,630
有莱纳德在隔壁嘶吼摇滚歌手莫莉莎的歌
come easily with Leonard in the next room

208
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,900
你就很难睡着了
singing along with Alanis Morrisette.

209
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,630
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

210
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,740
不  很显然某位来大姨夫的也急需冰淇淋来解闷
No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.

211
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,590
好吧  谢尔顿 有没有什么安慰点的消息
All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,660
关于这一点 我自行决定了来一场复赛
The part where I tell you i've engineered a rematch

213
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,960
今晚重新对战斯图尔特他们
with Stuart's team for tonight.

214
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,860
亲爱的  我不知道
Oh, honey, I don't know.

215
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,100
现在和莱纳德在一起感觉怪怪的
Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.

216
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,260
你想让我把他踢出去吗
You want me to remove him from the team?

217
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,060
我是队长  我说了算
I'm the captain. I can do that.

218
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,690
不  没关系
No, no, that's okay.

219
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,260
我去和他谈谈  回来再找你吧
Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.

220
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,990
你准备什么时候找他谈
When are you going to talk to him?

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,290
不知道
I don't know.

222
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,590
他在洗衣房  现在去正好
He's in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.

223
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,790
我不去你就一直烦我烦到死对吧
You're n gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?

224
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,440
哎呀  这还用问吗
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,290
我觉得我们应该谈谈
I think we should talk now.

226
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,990
什么  不  没事
Wha...? No, it's okay.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,590
我们不用谈  也没什么可谈
We don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about.

228
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,620
一切都好
Everything's good.

229
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,820
真的吗
Really?

230
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,360
那你生气不是因为
So, you didn't get all snarky

231
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,690
我对一碗辣味薯条说了句好话
'cause I said something nice to a bowl of chili fries?

232
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,790
好吧  也许我反应过激了
All right, maybe I overreacted.

233
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,220
我们俩感情上不太同步  那又如何
So we're in two different places emotionally. So what?

234
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,190
或许我比你快了一点  没关系
And maybe I'm a little ahead of you. That's fine.

235
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,990
其实很合理  面对现实
In fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it,

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,270
我爱你比你爱我多了整整两年
I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.

237
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,220
莱纳德  你要知道我很在乎你
Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you.

238
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,120
可我以前就是太早说"爱你"
It's just that I've said the "L" word

239
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,390
结果都不欢而散
too soon before, and it didn't work out very well.

240
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,020
是吗
Really?

241
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,590
不知道那是什么情形
I wouldn't know what that's like.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
对不起
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,890
但你明白我的意思
You know what I'm talking about, though.

244
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,860
我明白
Yeah, I do.

245
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,290
我们和好了吗
So, we're good?

246
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,890
对  我就是这个意思
Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

247
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,120
我们很好  好得不得了
We are good. We are great.

248
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,220
太好了  栅栏已补  误会已清
All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug.

249
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,670
去打保龄球吧
Time to bowl!

250
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,160
对  我刚刚在偷听
Yes, I was eavesdropping.

251
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,300
因为赌注太大了
There's a lot at stake here.

252
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,560
注意  选手们
Attention, all bowlers:

253
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,370
我强制要求穿这个参加我们的复赛
I've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.

254
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,520
"卫斯理·柯洛夏斯"
"The Wesley Crushers"?

255
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,920
不是指卫斯理·柯洛夏斯
No, not The Wesley Crushers.

256
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,160
而是卫斯理碾碎者
The Wesley Crushers.

257
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,290
我不明白
I don't get it.

258
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,520
卫斯理·柯洛夏是
Wesley Crusher was

259
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,390
威尔·惠顿在《星际迷航》里扮演的角色
Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.

260
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,620
还是不明白
Still don't get it.

261
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,990
这是个极其巧妙的双关语
It's a blindingly clever play on words.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,660
在他所饰演的角色名后面加个复数
By appropriating his character's name and adding the S,

263
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,630
暗示着我们将是彻底终结卫斯理的人
we imply that we we'll be the crushers of Wesley.

264
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,920
好吧  抱歉亲爱的
Okay, I'm sorry, honey,

265
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,190
但你这样写  看起来就好像有好多粉丝
but The Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people

266
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
喜欢卫斯理·柯洛夏
who like Wesley Crusher.

267
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,560
不  再次强调  不是卫斯理·柯洛夏粉丝群
No! Again, it's not the Wesley Crushers.

268
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,430
而是卫斯理·柯洛夏终结者
It's the Wesley Crushers.

269
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,860
如果你想表示  你将彻底打败卫斯理
No, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley,

270
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,960
就该直接写  打倒卫斯理·柯洛夏
it'd be the Wesley Crushers.

271
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,390
听听你们说的什么胡话
Do you people even hear yourselves?

272
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
这不是什么卫斯理·柯洛夏斯
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

273
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,390
也不是卫斯理粉丝群
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

274
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
而是卫斯理终结者
It's The Wesley Crushers.

275
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,020
看哪
Hey, look.

276
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,200
他们那队是以我名字命名的
They named their team after me.

277
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,420
不  这才不是...
No, it's not the...

278
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,400
算了
Never mind.

279
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,390
好了  都清楚打赌内容和赌注了
So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?

280
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,160
当然  输的一方将接受公开羞辱
Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated

281
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,420
具体方式由胜者选定
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

282
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,290
告诉你  我准备让你们发表篇科学论文
FYI: I plan on having you publish a scientific paper

283
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,200
（指Immanuel Velikovsky关于金星大气的假设）
详细说明维利科夫斯基那荒谬的假设
expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.

284
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,530
再次唉哟
Ouch again.

285
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,500
你好  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon,

286
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,660
我只想告诉你
I just wanted you to know

287
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,690
我热切期盼着打得你一败涂地
that I'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.

288
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,960
真的吗
Oh, yes?

289
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,590
回应你之前  我先问你个问题
Well, before I respond, let me a you a question.

290
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,930
你妈妈保龄球打得好不好
Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

291
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,430
你先
After you.

292
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,540
不  你先
No, after you...

293
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,670
因为我们准备终结你  卫斯理
as we are  currently crushing you, Wesley.

294
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,100
右边球道的选手先投  这是种习惯
It's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

295
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,400
好吧
All right.

296
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,860
只是种习惯  并非规则
It's a custom, not a rule.

297
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,220
我真鄙视你
I so loathe you.

298
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,290
就是这样  谢尔顿
That's right, Sheldon.

299
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,930
要学会接受社会阴暗面
Embrace the dark side.

300
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,900
你根本没权利跟我这么说
That's not even from your franchise!

301
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,890
我想让你知道 即使我们是对立一方
I, um, I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides,

302
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,120
我始终对你并无恶意
I, I bear you no ill will.

303
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,900
谢谢  斯图尔特  很高兴知道这点
Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.

304
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,060
对立双方的人 往往都关系非常好
People from opposite sides often have good relationships.

305
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,760
比如  罗密欧与朱丽叶
You know, Romeo and Juliet...

306
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,490
《西区故事》里的托尼和玛利亚
Tony and Maria from West Side Story,

307
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,900
《阿凡达》里那个谁和那大蓝妞
what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar.

308
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,130
我要去掷球了
I'm gonna bowl now.

309
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,590
人球合一  霍华德
Be the ball, Howard.

310
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,470
别烦我  谢尔顿
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

311
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,500
你没做到人球合一
You weren't the ball.

312
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,120
谢谢
Hey, thanks.

313
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,420
很好玩是吧
This is fun, huh?

314
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,720
对呀
Yeah.

315
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,790
很高兴我们能出来  来点体育锻炼
It's good that we got out and did something physical.

316
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,290
能分散下注意力
Gets us out of our heads.

317
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,190
人一旦纠结什么事
You get in your head,

318
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,390
很容易就会想多  钻牛角尖  心神不宁还烦恼
you start to overthink, overanalyze,obsess, you worry.

319
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,890
但今晚咱不这样
That's not what we're doing tonight.

320
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,890
今晚咱就专心玩保龄球
Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins.

321
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,320
对  就是这样
Yeah, that's right.

322
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,030
也许有一天  未来的某一天 你也会爱回我
and someday-- we don't know when-- maybe you'll love me back.

323
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
唔  该我了
Ooh, I'm up.

324
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,470
谢尔顿  谢尔顿  谢尔顿  加油
Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!

325
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,360
不好意思
Excuse me.

326
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,030
真不知道你们是在为谁加油  我现在可是球哦
I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.

327
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,520
球球  加油
The ball! The ball!

328
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,330
球球  加油
The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!

329
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,230
感谢上帝
Thank you, Jesus!

330
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,330
我妈肯定会这么说
As my mother would say.

331
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,320
很高兴你跟你男友言归于好了
I'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.

332
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,390
是呀  我也是
Oh, yeah, me, too.

333
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,420
在你毫无准备的时候  面对突如其来的示爱
It's always tough when the "L" bomb gets dropped

334
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,060
一向都很难处理的
and you're not ready for it.

335
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,520
说来听听
Tell me about it.

336
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,720
我就跟这么个女孩约会过
I dated this one girl,

337
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,190
我跟她示爱的时候
and I told her that I loved her,

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,560
她说她还不确定[自己感情的归属]
and she said she wasn't sure.

339
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,490
然后跟我藕断丝连将近两年时间
And she strung me along for almost two years.

340
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,760
那实在太残忍了
It was brutal.

341
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,760
太遗憾了
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,270
谢谢安慰
Thanks.

343
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,120
宁愿她当场就跟我痛快分手
I wish she had just broken up with me right there,

344
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,590
长痛不如短痛
and put me out of my misery.

345
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,590
真的
Really?

346
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,990
对  那样反而好
Yeah, would have been kinder.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,290
威尔  到你了
Wil, you're up.

348
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,270
该我了
Oh, that's me.

349
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,790
你刚让威尔·惠顿给你洗脑了
Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?

350
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,060
你在说什么呀
What are you talking about?

351
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,860
他是个魔鬼  最擅长邪恶的心理战
He's evil. He plays evil mind games.

352
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,720
（参见S03E05  谢尔顿的悲惨受骗遭遇）
他是不是跟你说他祖母去世了
Did he tell you his grandmother died?

353
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,220
没有
No!

354
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,920
他要是这么说  千万别信
Well, if he does, don't believe it.

355
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,370
他说不定就会骗你他祖母去世博同情
He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.

356
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,660
太棒了
Yes!

357
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,160
好好享受这一时的欢呼吧  威尔·惠顿
Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton,

358
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,290
但正如你在《星际迷航:下一代》那角色一样命运
but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation,

359
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,070
你这种自鸣得意  注定只能是一时的
your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.

360
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,420
佩妮  该你了
Penny, you're up.

361
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,800
好了  记住  他奶奶还活着
All right, remember, his meemaw's alive

362
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,060
还有  人球合一
and be the ball.

363
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,960
好  明白
Yeah, I got it.

364
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,490
我们必须要打出个全中啊
We really need a strike here.

365
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,460
我知道
I know.

366
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,320
所以慢慢来  集中注意力
So just take your time and concentrate.

367
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,290
莱纳德  别再给我施压了
Leonard, stop pressuring me.

368
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,360
我没在给你施压
I'm not pressuring you.

369
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,260
你就是在  给我让开
Yeah, you are! Just back off!

370
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,370
好吧  抱歉 我这就闭嘴
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

371
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,720
我没想让你闭嘴
I didn't mean "shut up."

372
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,690
好  告诉我该怎么说  我照做就是了
Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

373
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,520
不
No...

374
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,700
莱纳德  这对你不公平  我很抱歉
This isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.

375
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,460
等等  你这是去哪
Wait! Where are you going?

376
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,790
佩妮  快回来
Penny, come back!

377
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,160
我再给你买冰激凌
I'll get you ice cream!

378
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,460
别  让她走吧
No, let her go.

379
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,590
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

380
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,790
她要是走了  就完啦
If she leaves, it's over!

381
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,120
我很确定  我们已经完了[情侣关系]
I'm pretty sure it's already over.

382
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,200
谢尔顿  运气不佳嘛
Tough luck, Sheldon.

383
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,100
是你干的  是不是
You did this, didn't you?

384
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,560
你真以为就为了赢一场保龄球比赛
Do you think I would really break up a couple

385
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,960
我会拆散一对情侣
just to win a bowling match?

386
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,320
不  我想不会吧
No, I suppose not.

387
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,700
很好  你就继续这么想吧
Good. Keep thinking that.

388
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,220
对的  我跟你说
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I'm telling you,

389
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,260
（Match.com和eHarmony  均为婚恋交友网站）
Match.com上的妞比eHarmony上的更好泡
the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony.

390
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,850
好了  我回头再打给你
You know, I-I gotta call you back.

391
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,800
我打赢了个赌  该验收成果了
I won a bet, and it's time to collect.

392
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:23,800
（[分别为蝙蝠女侠  女超人  神奇女侠  猫女]）

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,930
不知道你们感觉如何  我觉得自己无比强大
I don't know about you, but I feel empowered.
