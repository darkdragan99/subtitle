1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,440
靠  我的维萨卡被撤了
Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,210
哦也  新的万事达卡
Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,510
干嘛
What?

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,410
我本来想拿信件
I was going to get my mail.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,210
拿啊
Okay.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,350
难道你想通过心灵感应来拿吗
Are... are you hoping to get it telepathically?

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,210
你是说意念取物吧
I think you mean telekinetically.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,050
不是
And no.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,230
我只是不确定用哪种社交礼节
I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,740
因为你和莱纳德如今不交媾了
now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,590
老天  你就不能说"不再见面交往"吗
God, can we please just say "no longer seeing each other"?

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,100
那得真的不见才行
Well, we could if it were true.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,540
可你们住在同一栋楼里  低头不见抬头见
But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,870
唯一改变的变量是交媾
The variable which has changed is the coitus.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,230
咱来定个协议 你我继续做朋友 还有你别再说"交媾"
Okay, here's the protocol: you and I are still friends, and you stop saying "coitus."

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,960
好啊
Good, good.

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,920
我很高兴我们还是朋友
I'm glad we're still friends.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,870
真的吗
Really?

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,220
当然  适应你出现在我日常生活中 可花了我不少功夫
Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,570
而我很讨厌白费功夫
I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,920
好吧
Right.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,840
再问清楚  我不能跟所有人说交媾 还是只是不能跟你说
Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,450
所有人
Everyone.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,970
协议条款真苛刻
Harsh terms.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,390
不过没关系  我可以用"性交"代替
But all right-- I'll just substitute "intercourse."

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,580
这下好了
Great.

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,950
或者用"私通"
Or "fornication."

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,230
但这个带有批评色彩 还是作为备用吧
Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,420
你最近怎样
So, how you been?

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,400
我的存在是个连续统一体
Well, my existence is a continuum,

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,770
所以在指定期间的每个时间点都是一样的
so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.

32
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,430
你就是逗我玩  是吧
You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,940
逗你玩
Bazinga.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,090
莱纳德好吗
How's Leonard doing?

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,540
他表面很好
He seems all right.

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,220
但他花了很长时间
Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,910
盯着你的照片
looking at photographs of you

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,300
嗅着你枕过的枕头
and smelling the pillow you slept on.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,780
我想起来了
Oh, but now that I think of it,

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,900
他叫我不要告诉你
he asked me not to tell you that.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,180
我会假装没听见
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,140
我宁愿你假装我没说过
I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,030
你买了意大利妈妈大蒜意粉酱
I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,610
对
Yep.

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,830
我妈妈也用这种酱
That's the sauce my mother uses.

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,140
她喜欢意式烹饪
She likes cooking Italian because according to her,

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,830
她说罗马人也这么做给耶稣吃
that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,170
有意思
Interesting.

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,780
我改天晚上叫你过来吃
I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,290
我现在就饿了
I'm hungry now.

51
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,970
好吧
Oh. Um, okay.

52
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,040
那一小时后过来吧
Why don't you give me an hour and come over?

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,510
能不能切点热狗丁 加到酱汁里
Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?

54
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,080
我没有热狗
I don't have hot dogs.

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
没关系  我有
Oh, it's all right; I do.

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,680
你就要做我妈妈所说的"美意大餐"
Oh! You're in for what my mother calls "a real Eye-talian treat".

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,400
你去哪了
Hey, where you been?

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,540
我刚刚和佩妮聊天呢
I was talking with Penny.

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,350
你怎么能这样
What's wrong with you?

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,460
你不能和室友的前任一起玩
You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.

61
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,970
这未免太逊了
That's totally uncool.

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,050
没关系  我不在乎
No, it's fine. I don't care.

63
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,760
我已经走出来了
I'm over it.

64
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
对  走出来了  所以他整天都在怨念
Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,790
要发明《黑超战警》里的洗脑装置
about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.

66
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,760
他有进展了吗
Is he making any progress?

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,410
因为我想忘掉本·阿弗莱克居然演过《超胆侠》
Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.

68
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,500
本·阿弗莱克也会想洗脑的
So would Ben Affleck.

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,790
重点是  面对这种情况 你得做出选择
The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides.

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,270
要么选莱纳德队  要么选择佩妮队
You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,710
哪个是选剩下的
Which one picks last?

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,250
什么
What?

73
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,730
我通常都只能在选剩下的那队
Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last.

74
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,510
除非有坐轮椅的孩子一起玩
Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.

75
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,990
谢尔顿  我给你买了陈皮鸡丁
Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,440
你应该饿了吧
I hope you're hungry.

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,480
我当然饿了
Well, of course I'm hungry.

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,760
而且我没打算跟别的队吃饭
And as I have no plans to eat with any other team,

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,640
我会津津有味地 吃光陈皮鸡丁
I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto.

80
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,860
好吧
Okay.

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
只是出于好奇  我们还有热狗吗
Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,580
不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,990
吃饭时随便聊聊而已
Just making dinner conversation.

84
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,870
加油  小莱队
Go, Team Leonard!

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,300
生活大爆炸第三季第二十集

86
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,870
啊  太好吃了
Oh, God, this is good.

87
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,540
我问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

88
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,440
你觉得你会因为
Do you believe you're going to go to hell

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,670
吃糖醋排骨而下地狱吗
for eating sweet and sour pork?

90
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,210
犹太人不相信有地狱
Jews don't have hell.

91
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,480
我们相信有胃酸倒流
We have acid reflux.

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,280
你要吃最后一只饺子吗  谢尔顿
Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,580
当然
Certainly.

94
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,610
我又没有因为很快要吃第二餐
It's not like I have to moderate my food intake

95
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,210
而故意限制食物摄入量
because I'm planning on eating again very shortly.

96
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,340
大家今晚想玩什么
So, you guys want to do something tonight?

97
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,940
我不行 我要去水中有氧运动班接我妈
Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class.

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,900
十八个超重妇女在游泳池里 甩着肥大的手臂
18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool.

99
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,170
就像海洋世界里的海牛
Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.

100
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,940
你呢  拉杰
What about you, Raj?

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,280
这算什么
Oh, there it is:

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,710
你没有女朋友了
now that you don't have a girlfriend,

103
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,680
就又想跟我玩了
you want to hang out with me again.

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,180
-我什么时候没跟你玩了  -少来了
- I never stopped hanging out with you. - Oh, please,

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,350
大家都清楚你没有人了 才会来找我
we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options.

106
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,020
如果我们是正义联盟  我就是海王子
If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,970
我倒希望你是海王子
I wish you were Aquaman.

108
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,670
我就能派你去老人池里把我妈舀出来
Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,280
抱歉  我渴了  我要去冰箱里
Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator

110
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,110
拿点清凉饮料喝
and get myself a refreshing beverage.

111
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,880
算了  我今晚就一个人过吧
You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.

112
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,890
怎么  我突然就不配陪你了
What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,190
我最爱饮料了
I do so love beverages.

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,130
我现在要去饭后散步了
Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.

115
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,900
你什么时候开始饭后散步了
Since when do you take after-dinner walks?

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,000
你什么时候开始散步了
Yeah, since when do you take walks?

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,810
我在网上看过一篇论文  饭后百步走
I read a study online that walking after a meal

118
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,610
不仅有助于消化  还能增加5-羟色胺的含量
not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin,
（一种有利于神经细胞间冲动传导的有机物）

119
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,340
而且你们也知道的  如果说相比提神饮料
and you know me, if there's one thing I like

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,110
我更喜欢什么  那肯定就是5-羟色胺了  拜拜
more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,420
等等  我和你一起走
Hold on. I'll walk down with you.

122
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,320
没那个必要吧
That's not necessary.

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,650
你先走吧
You can go first.

124
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,060
要么咱俩一起走
Or we could go together.

125
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,960
我想不出什么理由拒绝你
I can't think of a reason why not.

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,060
咱们走吧
Let's go.

127
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,530
等一下
Hold on.

128
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,700
没事  我还是想不出什么理由
Nope, no reason.

129
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,610
我好想你
I've missed you.

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,850
行了  代我向你妈妈问好
All right, say hello to your mother for me.

131
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,110
行啊
Okay.

132
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,720
干嘛
What?

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,490
你刚说你要去散步的
You said you were going for a walk.

134
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,190
我又没说要去外面散步
I didn't say outside.

135
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,330
然后呢  你就打算来来回回地跑楼梯吗
So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?

136
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,900
不会  当然不会
No, of course not.

137
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,770
那样的话就太可疑了
That would be odd and suspicious behavior.

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,770
到这儿来  拉塞尔  过来呀  宝贝儿
Here, Russell! Here, boy!

139
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,230
你往哪边走
Which way are you going?

140
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,740
"你" 往哪边走
Which way are "you" going?

141
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,200
我把摩托车停在街那边了
I parked my scooter down the block.

142
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,170
我走另一边  拜拜
I'm going the other way. Bye.

143
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,670
拜拜
Bye.

144
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,710
其实是停在这边
Actually, I'm this way.

145
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,850
这是热狗的味道吗
Do I smell hot dogs?

146
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,780
不是  我是说  我不知道你闻到了什么
No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.

147
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,820
我绝对闻到了生热狗的味道
I definitely smell raw hot dog.

148
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,120
估计是你的脑子里有肿瘤吧
Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,420
好了  散步愉快
All right, have a nice walk.

150
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,790
我会的  祝你开车愉快
I shall. Have a nice scoot.

151
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,760
你最好站开点儿
You might want to stand back.

152
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,160
寡人的坐骑有13马力呢
I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.

153
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,500
你好啊  狗狗
Oh. Hello, doggie.

154
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,170
乖狗狗
Nice doggie.

155
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,970
估计你是闻到热狗的香味了
I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,640
看  有猫咪
Look, a cat!

157
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,770
佩妮
Penny?

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,770
佩妮
Penny.

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
佩妮
Penny.

160
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,580
给
Here.

161
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,610
剩下的热狗被我拿去保命了
I had to trade the others for my life.

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,540
喂  莱纳德
Hey, Leonard?

163
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,840
怎么了
Yeah?

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,210
我有一年没做爱了
I haven't had sex in a year.

165
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,510
你想干嘛  拉杰
Where you going with this, Raj?

166
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,480
别自作多情了  老兄
Don't flatter yourself, dude.

167
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,780
我想出去找个女人
I want to go out and meet a woman.

168
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,480
那就去呗  -我要找个帮手
- So, go.  - Well, I need a wingman.

169
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,850
我不想让自己看着像个失败的剩男
I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.

170
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,360
你觉得我跟你去你就不剩了吗
And you think "my" presence will help with that?

171
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,660
对呀
Well, I do.

172
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,360
有你在旁边  我有更有把握了
Next to you, I'll look like a catch.

173
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,930
我今晚不会出去的  拉杰
I'm not going out tonight, Raj.

174
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,530
好吧
All right.

175
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,060
你介意我到你房间去
Would you mind if I went to your room

176
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,170
下载几部亚系A片看吗
and downloaded some Asian pornography?

177
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,700
非常介意
Very much.

178
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
我可以不看亚系的
Doesn't have to be Asian.

179
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,540
别担心  总有一天你会遇见一个好姑娘的
Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.

180
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,680
-不可能的  -绝对可能  而且还很漂亮
- No, I won't.  - Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful.

181
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
善良  性感  幽默
And kind and sexy and funny

182
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,510
绝对是你梦中情人的样子
and everything you ever wanted in a woman.

183
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,580
你真这么觉得
You really think so?

184
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,320
没错  你会一发不可收拾地 爱上她  向她敞开心扉
I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart.

185
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,190
然后她会拿走你的心  残忍地撕成碎片
And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.

186
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,590
但我们到时候会先上床  对吧
But we'll have sex first, right?

187
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,670
真正的美意大餐
That's Eye-talian.

188
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,370
莱纳德不介意你过来吧
So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?

189
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,240
不介意
Oh, yes.

190
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,040
其实他说了  "我没事  我不在乎"
In fact, he said, "I'm fine. I don't care."

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
而且他的语气绝对不会
And he in no way said it in a manner

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,750
让人觉得他在掩饰心中的
which would lead one to believe that he was covering up

193
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,680
痛苦与背叛
feelings of anguish and betrayal.

194
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,690
-很好嘛  -我还要
- Well, good.  - I'm also

195
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,420
很高兴地告诉你他曾为你大声痛哭
pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.

196
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,960
他哭过
He's been crying?

197
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,190
我又漏说了一件
Oh, I believe that was something else

198
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,560
不该跟你提起的事
I wasn't supposed to mention.

199
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,860
哦  天哪  我好难过
Oh, God, I feel terrible.

200
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,130
你也胃疼吗
Do you have a stomachache, too?

201
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,770
没有啊  怎么了  你胃疼吗
No. Why, do you?

202
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,470
不疼
No.

203
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,170
那你为啥问我是不是也胃疼
Why did you ask if I had one, too?

204
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,210
就是吃饭的时候随便聊聊
Just making polite dinner conversation.

205
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,570
该你说了
Your turn.

206
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,810
好吧
All right.

207
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,980
那你最近有啥新鲜事儿吗
So, what's new in your life?

208
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,420
我的新鞋不适合跑步
Well, my new shoes are not made for running.

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,250
你去跑步了
Have you been running?

210
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,990
没有
No.

211
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,060
这只是我的怀疑
It's just a suspicion I have.

212
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,730
-我很高兴你这么喜欢我的手艺  -没错
- I'm so glad you like it.  -I do.

213
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,530
莱纳德从来没给我做过饭
Leonard never cooks for me.

214
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,930
估计是因为莱纳德不会做饭吧
Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.

215
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,470
你也不会做饭  但是你为我做了这些
You can't cook and you made me this.

216
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,370
随便啦
Whatever.

217
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,410
对了  还有芝士蛋糕在冰箱里
Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.

218
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,910
天  我要下犹太人的地狱了[胃酸倒流]
Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

219
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,600
你看这个
Look at this.

220
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
你觉得她这动作是真的呢
Do you think she's really doing that

221
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,370
还是PS出来的
or is it PhotoShop?

222
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,940
我很确定玛莎·斯图尔特绝对不会光着身子
I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked
（著名女企业家  曾因经济犯罪入狱）

223
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,010
和一屋子的日本大胖子呆在一起
with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.

224
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,540
你又不知道
You don't know that.

225
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,580
监狱能改变一个人的
Prison changes people.

226
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
你刚去哪儿了
Hey, where you been?

227
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,310
跟你说了嘛  散步啊
I told you, walking.

228
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,470
你散了一个半小时的步
For an hour and a half?

229
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,840
我迷路了
I got lost.

230
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,310
你怎么会迷路的  你的手机上有GPS啊
How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.

231
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,150
卫星出故障了  有太阳风暴
Satellites are down. Solar flares.

232
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,550
这会儿没有太阳风暴
There are no solar flares right now.

233
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,780
不对  有的
Yes, there are.

234
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,150
老兄  我是搞天体物理的
Dude, I'm an astrophysicist.

235
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,650
要是有太阳风暴的话  我绝对会知道
If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

236
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,690
抱歉  我说错了
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

237
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,560
我刚才其实想说我手机没电了
What I meant to say was my battery died.

238
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,730
他到底是怎么回事啊
What the hell was that about?

239
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,200
不知道
I don't know.

240
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,570
你觉得这真的是希拉里·克林顿在和欧普拉嘿咻吗
Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?

241
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,100
哦  我们真得给你找个小妞了
Oh, we really need to get you a girl.

242
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,540
莱纳德
Leonard.

243
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,910
莱纳德
Leonard.

244
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,180
莱纳德
Leonard.

245
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,610
滚进来吧
Oh, just come in!

246
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,790
谢谢你这么痛快地让我进来了
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

247
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,360
你想干嘛  谢尔顿
What do you want, Sheldon?

248
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,030
可能现在不是时候
Maybe this isn't a good time.

249
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,860
快说你干嘛吵醒我  不然我对天发誓我会杀了你
Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.

250
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,530
你真觉得用死亡威胁我
Do you really think death threats

251
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,700
是展开谈话的恰当方式吗
are an appropriate way to begin this conversation?

252
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,800
有时候  你的社交能力少得简直让我震惊
Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.

253
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,870
你到底想干嘛
What do you want?

254
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,070
你最好先坐下
You may want to sit down.

255
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,880
我正躺着呢
I'm in bed!

256
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,040
了解
Point taken.

257
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,350
你最好先坐起来
You may want to sit up.

258
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,080
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

259
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,720
我一直在背着你见佩妮
I've been seeing Penny behind your back.

260
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,160
好吧
Okay...

261
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,060
你说你"见佩妮"  到底什么意思
When you say "seeing Penny," what exactly does that mean?

262
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,330
我们昨晚一起吃晚餐了
We had dinner last night.

263
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,300
她给我做了意粉加热狗丁
She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it.

264
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,170
虽然热狗丁很少
Well, little hot dog.

265
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,170
因为还有五根热狗我都给那条真的狗狗吃了
I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog.

266
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,510
很大只的真的狗狗
A real, big dog.

267
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,440
是条该死的猎狗
A hell hound.

268
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,140
我好像离题太远了
Tangential to the primary story.

269
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,240
等下再绕回来说如何
How about I circle back to it?

270
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,380
好
Fine.

271
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,280
你为什么要跟佩妮一起晚餐
Why did you have dinner with Penny?

272
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,380
我说过了  她做了意粉加热狗丁
I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs.

273
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,750
我喜欢吃意粉加热狗丁
I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

274
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,950
那你为什么还跟我们一起吃中餐
Then why did you have Chinese food with us?

275
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,790
我是怕你不高兴
I didn't want to upset you.

276
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,520
霍华德说得很清楚  我应该先效忠于
Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be

277
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,690
男同志  而不是为钱卖身的女人们
to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.

278
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,800
莫非他说的是  兄弟比妓女重要
Is it possible he said, "Bros before hos"?

279
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,440
对  我改了下措辞  避免提到妓女这个词
Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.

280
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,780
谢尔顿  你跟佩妮做不做朋友我都无所谓
Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.

281
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,410
这么说  一直困扰我让我噩梦连连的
Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me

282
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,450
这种情绪波动  真的是完全不应该啊
from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?

283
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,450
没错
Yes.

284
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,020
要是我奶奶肯定会说
Well... then as my meemaw would say,

285
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,320
我们在这宰猪待客  可居然没人想吃培根[都不领情]
"Looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."

286
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
我想是的
I guess not.

287
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,160
现在  之前我承诺过的  那个题外话
And now, as promised, the tangent.

288
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,600
谢尔顿大战猎狗记
Sheldon and the Hell Hound.

289
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,460
或者说"谁动了我的热狗"
Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.

290
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,570
我还是回头再来吧
I, I can come back.

291
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,070
别傻了
D-don't be silly.

292
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,170
我们是邻居
We're neighbors.

293
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,370
抬头不见低头见
We're going to run into each other.

294
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,540
还是早点习惯的好
May as well get used to it.

295
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,540
嗯  你说得对
Yeah, I guess you're right.

296
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,750
你习惯了吗
You used to it yet?

297
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,650
-还没  -我也是
- Nope. - Me neither.

298
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,050
谢尔顿好像认为他跟你出去
Oh, Sheldon seemed to think that I would be upset

299
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,190
我会不高兴
about you hanging out with him.

300
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,720
我只是告诉你  没事的
But I just want you to know it's fine.

301
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
太好了  因为他妈妈打电话给我了
Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.

302
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,390
他妈妈
His mother?

303
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,930
对  她想让我带他出去买床单和毛巾
Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.

304
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,630
我本来打算带他去的
I was going to do that.

305
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,830
是吗  那还是你带吧
Oh, well, then you... you do it.

306
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,940
不  我根本就不想带  还是你来吧
No, I don't want to do it. You can do it.

307
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,240
好  那你可以带他去买鞋
Okay, you can take him for shoes.

308
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,310
我刚带他去买过鞋
I just took him for shoes.

309
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,410
我只知道他说那鞋子挤脚
Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.

310
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,150
好吧  下周六我会带他去买鞋
Fine. I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.

311
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,210
不行不行  我们一帮同事
Oh, no, no, no-- a bunch of us from work

312
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,620
下周六要去迪斯尼乐园
are going to Disneyland next Saturday

313
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,980
谢尔顿也想一起去
and Sheldon wants to come.

314
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,720
你们要带他去迪斯尼乐园
You're taking him to Disneyland?

315
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,790
我讲电话订计划的时候他正好听到
Well, he heard me making plans on the phone.

316
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,320
那我还能拒绝吗
Was I going to say "no"?

317
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,620
好吧
All right.

318
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,690
你们让他塞一堆垃圾食品前  记得先跟我说下
But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food.

319
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,760
我可不想帮他打包回一顿美餐 结果只能浪费掉
I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.

320
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
我们是去迪斯尼乐园玩
We're going to Disneyland.

321
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,370
他肯定会吃垃圾食品
He's going to eat junk food.

322
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,670
我只是说  事先跟我打个招呼
All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.

323
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,370
好吧  随便吧
Okay, whatever.

324
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,540
还有别让他吃饱了再去玩太空山
And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats.

325
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,340
他会说没问题  但我敢肯定
He'll say he can handle it, but I promise

326
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,310
他绝对会把油条都吐你鞋子上
you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.

327
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,210
好的  明白  还有什么提醒的吗
All right, got it. Is there anything else?

328
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,610
有  别让他靠近高飞狗
Yeah, don't let Goofy near him.

329
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,450
他会噩梦连连  到时候还得我处理
He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.

330
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,050
高飞狗有什么问题
What's the problem with Goofy?

331
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,220
我也想知道  不过让他靠近布鲁托没事
Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

332
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
你觉得《超人总动员》里那个弹力女超人
Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles

333
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,570
需要用避孕套吗  还是她自己就能变成套子
needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?

334
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,710
就这样吧
Well, that's it.

335
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,710
能聊的话题正式都谈完了
We're officially out of things to talk about.

336
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,810
我们回来了
We're home.

337
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,670
都晚上十点了  你们去哪了
It's 10:00.Where have you been?

338
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,490
我们留在那看加州冒险乐园的喷泉秀
We stayed for the California Adventure water show.

339
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,860
纯粹因为迪斯尼魔力太大
It was pure Disney magic.

340
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,320
我准备跟他一起去看的
I was going to see that with him.

341
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,930
那我怎么知道
How was I supposed to know that?

342
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,260
没事的  我会跟你一起再去看一遍的
It's all right. I'll see it again with you.

343
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,460
我还帮他带了吃的  你说过你会先打电话的
And I have food here. You said you were going to call.

344
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,760
我知道是我不好
I know, I know.

345
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,730
我还吃得下
I can still eat.

346
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,900
不行  你已经吐过一次了
No, you already threw up once.

347
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,800
去换上睡衣刷牙
Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.

348
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,170
好吧  但你们俩别吵架
Okay, but just don't fight

349
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,310
-我们没在吵架  -快去
- We're not fighting. - Just go.

350
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,540
你不谢谢佩妮带你去迪斯尼乐园玩吗
Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?

351
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,910
谢谢你  佩妮
Thank you, Penny.

352
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,180
不客气  亲爱的
You're welcome, sweetie.

353
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,980
想来杯咖啡吗
Want a cup of coffee?

354
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,320
我还是先走吧
Oh, um, I should probably get going.

355
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,660
好了  就一杯咖啡而已
Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.

356
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,260
我也觉得这整件事有点扭曲
Uh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.

357
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,400
这是什么气味
What am I smelling?

358
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,830
谢尔顿吐在我鞋子上的油条
Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

359
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,980
他睡着的时候  看着真像天使
He's such an angel when he's asleep.

360
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,850
是啊
Yeah.

361
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,020
可惜他还会醒来
Shame he has to wake up.

362
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,590
我觉得我们能做到的
I think we can do it.

363
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,130
趁谢尔顿睡着时闷死他  那不合适吧
Smother Sheldon in his sleep?Wouldn't that be wrong?

364
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,300
不  你跟我  做朋友
No, be friends. You and me.

365
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,230
当然
Oh. Sure.

366
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,870
绝对没问题
Absolutely.

367
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,240
很好  我很开心
Good. I'm glad.

368
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,610
我有个主意  我就随便说说
Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it out there:

369
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,770
当炮友如何
friends who have sex.

370
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,140
晚安  莱纳德
Good night, Leonard.

371
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,780
我开玩笑的
Kidding.

372
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,150
只是朋友间玩笑打混而已
Just a couple of friends Goofing around.

373
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,880
不  高飞狗  别
No, Goofy, no.
