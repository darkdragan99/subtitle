1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,220
我们还有多少时间
How much time do we have?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,390
倒数5小时37分钟
Uh, T-minus five hours, 37 minutes

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,020
流星雨开始
to onset of meteor shower.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,120
我们的位置是北纬34.48°  西经118.21°
Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,690
这意味着方位角应该是...
That means the azimuth should be...

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,920
相对磁北168.22°
168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,620
外加仰角49.93°
with an elevation of 49.93.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,950
有什么了吗
Anything yet?

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,850
我们有信号  却不能锁定坐标
Uh, we have a signal, but there's no frame lock.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,990
等等  现在如何
Hang on. How about... now?

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,950
我们成功了
We did it.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,390
我们收到西海岸HBO电视台的信号了
We have the West Coast feed of HBO.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,220
哇  《真实性爱》
Ooh, Real Sex.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,990
这可好看了  每次我看这节目
Big deal. Every time I watch that show,

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,290
都是个老女人往黄瓜上套安全套
it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,150
那好  让我们来看看东海岸在播什么
All right, let's see what's on the East Coast feed.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,920
喔  是《沙丘》
Oh, hey. Dune.

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,520
不算是个好电影
Not a great movie,

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,490
但看看这美丽的沙漠啊
but look at that beautiful desert.

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,950
谢尔顿不能来真可惜
Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,020
没有他在感觉有点不大对头
Yeah, it's just not the same without him.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,250
这电影太烂了  我换回去看《真实性爱》
Oh, this sucks. I'm switching back to Real Sex.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,320
谢尔顿日志
Sheldon's log.

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,120
星历63345.3
Stardate 63345.3.

25
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,990
当我的同事们离开
While my colleagues are off

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,790
去观测狮子座流星雨时
observing the Leonid meteor shower,

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,450
我留守后方完成我关于
I have remained behind to complete my paper

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,720
高激发态大质量弦状态衰变的论文
on the decays of highly excited massive string states.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,790
尽管我的研究进展顺利
Although my research is going well,

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,290
我确实很想念人类陪伴的温暖
I do miss the warmth of human companionship.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
生活大爆炸第三季第八集

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,930
晚上好  暹罗宫
And good evening to you, Siam Palace.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,530
我是谢尔顿·库珀
This is Sheldon Cooper.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,700
我今晚要孤独一人进餐
Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening,

35
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,200
所以我要减少通常的菜单
so I'll be reducing my usual order.

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,070
我的前菜要四分之一份
I'd like to start with one quarter

37
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,800
什锦小吃
of the Assorted Appetizers Plate

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,830
然后要两人份的金宝贝的一半
and, uh, one half of the Golden Treasure for two.

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,200
看在老天的份上  在18世纪中页
Oh, for heaven's sake. In the mid-18th century,

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,100
暹罗国王拉玛四世将巨大的帝国
King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire

41
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,000
割让给了欧洲的各大殖民势力
amongst the colonial powers of Europe

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,700
目的是为了保住王位
in order to preserve his throne.

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,670
理所当然的  你  他的文化继承者
Surely, you, his cultural descendant,

44
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,200
也能搞定这些泰式炒面和饺子
can handle pad Thai and dumplings.

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,030
谢尔顿  救命
Sheldon, help!

46
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,500
我要挂了  但是记住我在yelp.com那些
I need to go-- but you keep in mind

47
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,970
关于一家本地松饼店
that my sharply worded comments

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,100
言辞尖锐的评论
on Yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.

49
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,100
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny. Penny.

50
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,430
进来  快点
Come in! Hurry!

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,070
佩妮
Penny?

52
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,430
我在里面
I'm back here.

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,900
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny. Penny.

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,270
哦  老天  我在浴室里
Oh, for God's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,630
我该挑个更恰当的时机再来吗
Shall I come back at a better time?

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,230
给我进来
Get in here!

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,130
快点
Hurry!

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,430
你敢再敲门试试
Don't you dare knock!

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,770
你好
Hello.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,870
我在浴缸里滑倒了
I slipped in the shower,

61
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,600
我觉得肩膀好像脱臼了
and I think I dislocated my shoulder.

62
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,400
这不奇怪
Not surprising.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,530
你没有装防滑垫或者防滑贴纸
You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
来抵消浴缸表面的
to allow for purchase on a surface

65
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,130
很低的静摩擦系数
with a low coefficient of static friction.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,230
什么
What?

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,630
浴缸都很滑的
Tubs are slippery.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,930
我知道  我滑倒了
I know. I slipped.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,970
我有一个系列的古怪鸭贴纸
I have a series of whimsical duck stickers

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,030
贴在我的浴缸底部
on the bottom of my tub.

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,170
好吧  无论如何
Yeah, okay, whatever.

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,000
你能把水关掉再扶我起来吗
Will you just turn the water off and help me up?

73
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,970
他们都撑着伞的
They're holding umbrellas.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,700
什么
What?

75
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,230
我浴缸里的鸭子
The ducks in my tub.

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,330
它们怪就怪在这些鸭子既没有需要
They're whimsical because ducks have neither a need for,

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
也没有能力来使用雨伞
nor the ability to use, umbrellas.

78
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,130
上帝啊  我得去急救中心了
Oh, my God. I got to go to the emergency room.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,430
如果你确定你的右上膊骨
Well, assuming you're correct that your right humerus

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
不再固定在肩臼上
is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,

81
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,770
-我当然认为你该去急救中心  -你能车我去吗
- I would certainly think so.  - Okay, can you drive me?

82
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,230
我不开车的
I don't drive.

83
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,370
但我开不了
Well, I can't drive!

84
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,230
看来我们到达了一个僵局
Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,800
我可以帮你叫辆的士或者救护车
I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,470
不 不 不  我等不及了
No, no, no. I can't wait that long.

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,830
你必须得帮我  求你了
You got to help me, please.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,870
好的  不能让人说谢尔顿·李·库珀
All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper

89
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,970
是个无视陷入困境的少女的人
ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.

90
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,800
没人这么说  快走吧
No one's saying that. Let's go.

91
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,530
因没买99美分的防滑鸭子
Well, it does seem rather ironic

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
而导致两个人都可能死于惨烈的车祸
that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

93
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,000
这看上去真是非常讽刺
we both might die in a fiery car crash.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,700
我真希望佩妮不用去工作
I wish Penny didn't have to work.

95
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,830
她喜欢野营
She loves camping.

96
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,430
是啊  那就太好了
Yeah, that would have been great.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,130
你和佩妮在帐篷里做爱
You and Penny having sex in the tent

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,000
而我则坐在外面看霍华德拿仙人掌爆菊
while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,630
好的  我已经尽力侦查了
Okay, the best I can tell,

100
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,230
附近还有8个野营地
there are eight other campsites nearby.

101
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,670
大多都是像我们这样的科学呆子
Mostly science nerds like us,

102
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,800
不过山脊另一边
but just over yon ridge are two

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,700
有两位不无魅力的中学老师
not unattractive middle school teachers

104
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,500
浑身散发着绝望主妇的气息
who reek of desperation.

105
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,470
太好了
Wow. Wonderful.

106
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,200
-她们多大  -我不知道
- How old are they? - I don't know.

107
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,870
50岁  55岁吧
50, 55.

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,770
更年期妇女
Oh, menopause.

109
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,300
天然的节育控制
Nature's birth control.

110
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,470
拜托
Come on.

111
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,230
你们不会这么饥渴吧
You guys can't be that hard up.

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,370
-我饥渴  -我也是
- I am. - Yeah, me, too.

113
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,730
看  她们还送了点自制曲奇给我们
Look-- they gave me homemade cookies.

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,770
当然会给
Of course, they did.

115
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,430
老奶奶都这样
That's what grandmothers do.

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,070
那我们还等什么
So, what are we waiting for?

117
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,170
悠着点
Relax.

118
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,970
我说等她们打完盹
I said we'd stop by a little later

119
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,100
我们再过去
after they have their nap.

120
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,170
好主意
Good idea.

121
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,330
睡醒精力比较足
They'll be refreshed.

122
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,770
吃曲奇吗
Cookie?

123
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,530
好  谢谢
Yeah. Thank you.

124
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,530
不错啊
Not bad.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,970
很好吃啊
Yeah, very tasty.

126
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,700
再说说那些老师的情况
Well, so tell me more about these teachers.

127
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,000
没什么了
Not much to tell.

128
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,730
她们开了辆大众车
They had a VW microbus

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,770
穿着扎染的感恩而死乐队T恤
and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirts.

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,930
美味曲奇
Good cookies.

131
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,730
这里乱得简直毫无编制体系而言
I see no organizational system in here whatsoever.

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,430
你周一穿什么内裤
Which panties do you wear on Mondays?

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
我不要内裤
I don't need panties.

134
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,900
只要短裤和衬衫
I just need shorts and a shirt.

135
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,200
妈妈经常跟我说
My mother always told me

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,430
一个人要穿干净内裤
one should wear clean underpants

137
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,100
以防发生意外
in case one is in an accident.

138
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,200
我已经发生意外了
One was already in an accident.

139
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,870
那不表示不会再发生意外
That doesn't mean one won't be in another,

140
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,300
尤其是我开车的情况下
especially if I'm driving.

141
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,500
拿衣服  谢尔顿
Clothes, Sheldon.

142
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,900
-我要衣服  -好啦
- I need clothes! - Okay.

143
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,670
给
Here.

144
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,430
不会吧  这条裤子配这件上衣
Seriously? Those shorts with that top?

145
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,100
好吧
All right.

146
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,000
不行
No.

147
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,900
不行
No.

148
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,670
这件好看
Oh, that's cute.

149
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,070
一会儿该给你查查有没有脑震荡
We should have you checked for a concussion.

150
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,900
好了
Okay.

151
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,130
你得帮我穿衣服
Now, you got to help me put these on.

152
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,130
-好吧  -不许看啊
- All right. - But don't look.

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,000
-不许看?  -我不想让你看我裸体
- Don't look? - I don't want you to see me naked.

154
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,070
哦
Oh.

155
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,730
这可以理解
Well, that's understandable.

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
你或许会有兴趣知道
You may be interested to know

157
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,170
禁止看对方
that a prohibition against looking

158
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,400
早在英雄神话里就有确立
is well established in heroic mythology.

159
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,600
洛特王和他妻子  珀尔修斯和美杜莎
Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa,

160
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,430
-奥菲士和欧律狄刻  -知道啦
- Orpheus and Eurydice... - Yeah, great.

161
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
他们都看了
They always look.

162
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,370
结局都很不好
It never ends well.

163
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,970
好了  现在帮我把手穿进袖子
Okay. Now you got help me get my arm into the sleeve.

164
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,400
好的
Okay.

165
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,630
那是我的手臂吗
Is that my arm?

166
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,670
感觉不像手臂
It doesn't feel like an arm.

167
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,570
那你是不是该放手了
Then, maybe you should let it go.

168
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,430
好滴
All righty.

169
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,500
星星好漂漂啊
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

170
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,630
在那高高的地方
Up above the world so high.

171
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,200
像天上的小钻石
Like little diamonds in the sky.

172
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,530
太优美了  兄弟
That's beautiful, dude.

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,230
你应该把这句话写下来
You should... you should write that down

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,070
免得被人山寨了
before someone steals it.

175
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,170
流星雨什么时候来
So, when do the meteors get here?

176
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,900
不是流星雨来这里
The meteors don't get here.

177
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,930
是地球走到他们的轨道上了
The Earth is moving into their path.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
我能感觉到
I can feel it.

179
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,300
我能感觉到地球在移动
I can feel the Earth moving.

180
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,570
移动得太快
It's moving too fast.

181
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,300
拉杰  让地球慢点
Raj, slow it down.

182
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,330
行了  现在如何
Okay, how's that?

183
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,600
好多了  谢谢
Better. Thanks.

184
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,570
星星多漂漂啊
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
笑什么
What's so funny?

186
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,030
笑你的美国口音
It's your American accent.

187
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,600
你说的话都很傻逼
Everything you say sounds stupid.

188
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,970
星星多漂漂啊
"Stars are pretty, aren't they?"

189
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,330
为准确起见  我得告诉你
For the record, I should let you know

190
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,000
这是我第一次开真的汽车
this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.

191
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,070
你有实习驾照吧
You have your learner's permit, right?

192
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,500
有  我还在
Yes, and I have logged

193
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,070
模拟装置上开了很长时间
a considerable number of hours on a simulator.

194
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,770
-那就行  -但效果不太好
- Good. - Didn't work out well.

195
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,770
-行了  能开了吗  -等一下
- All right, can we please go? - One moment.

196
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,730
驾驶培训书里说
According to my driver's ed book,

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
侧视镜的正确角度是
the side mirror is properly adjusted

198
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,170
调到能在镜子的右下角
when the driver's door handle

199
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,770
看到部分门把手
is visible in the lower right corner.

200
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,870
看到门拉手了
There's the handle.

201
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,270
不不  太过了
Oh, no, too far.

202
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,000
往回一点点
Bringing it back.

203
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,370
这才正好
Optimized.

204
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,070
好  调整副驾驶座
Now, where is the switch

205
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,200
后视镜的调节器呢
to adjust the passenger side mirror?

206
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,130
就在这里
It's right there.

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,970
副驾驶座的后视镜在哪儿呢
Where is the passenger side mirror?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,170
在好莱坞的停车场时被撞掉了
In a parking lot in Hollywood.

209
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,430
-行行好  我们能走了吗  -好
- Now, can we please go? - Yes.

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,800
先等我调整好座椅
As soon as I adjust my seat.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,100
噢  老天
Oh, dear.

212
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,030
我又得重来一次
I'm going to have to start again.

213
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,930
如果我会说兔子的语言
If I could speak the language of rabbits,

214
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,830
那就太美妙了  我将成为兔王
that will be amazed, I will be their king.

215
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,100
我讨厌我的名字
I hate my name.

216
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,430
读起来像个呆子
It has "nerd" in it.

217
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,500
莱呆子
Len-nerd.

218
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,870
我的第一次是和我的表姐珍妮
I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.

219
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,570
我会仁慈地对待我的兔民们
I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

220
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,100
当然只是开始而已
At first.

221
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,830
知道什么才叫酷名吗
You know what's a cool name?

222
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,370
安杰洛
Angelo.

223
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,770
有天使又有洁露果子冻
That has angel and Jell-O in it.

224
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,900
那是在我穆雷舅舅的葬礼上
It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.

225
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,400
我们在芭芭拉阿姨的房子后面
We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house.

226
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,870
透过一条腌鲱鱼  我们四目相接
Our eyes locked over the pickled herring.

227
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,930
我们本来没想着会发生关系的
We never meant for it to happen.

228
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,500
一天  我为法国总统举办了一场盛大舞会
One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France,

229
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,700
但是兔民们  因为憎恨我而没来捧场
but the rabbits-- they hate me and don't come.

230
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,670
我极为尴尬  于是我逼它们眼睁睁地看着
I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world

231
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,730
我吃光世界上所有的莴苣
and make them watch.

232
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,030
别人可以昵称我安吉
People could call me Angie.

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,300
(史泰龙状)  哟  安吉  最近咋样
(la Sylvester Stallone): Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?

234
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,470
直到如今  每次一看到腌鲱鱼
To this day, I can't look at pickled herring

235
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,530
就会忍不住尴尬性奋
without being aroused and ashamed.

236
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,130
噢  珍妮阿姐
Oh! Cousin Jeanie.

237
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,830
你就不能开快点吗
Could you please drive a little faster?

238
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,630
我觉得已经够快了
Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast.

239
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
什么情况
What's that?

240
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,670
没事  引擎时不时会这样
Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.

241
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,830
没事才怪
It can't be nothing.

242
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,000
检查引擎指示灯都亮了
The check engine light is on.

243
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,400
我们得去服务站
We need to find a service station.

244
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,730
自我买回这辆车  这灯就一直亮着
No. The light has been on since I bought the car.

245
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
那就更应该去了
All the more reason

246
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,900
趁这车爆炸之前  找维修师来处理
to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.

247
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,200
爆炸个鬼啊
It's not going to explode.

248
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,500
快开车
Just keep driving.

249
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,770
曲速前进  史波克长官
Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

250
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,870
史波克不是企业号的驾驶员
Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise.

251
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,600
他是科学官  还有我保证
He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that

252
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,200
只要他看到企业号的检查引擎指示灯
if he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking,

253
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,000
闪那么一下  他会立刻下令靠边停
he would pull the ship over immediately.

254
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,430
老天  我的手臂完了
Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.

255
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,630
红灯
Oh, well, red light.

256
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
先松开油门
Release accelerator

257
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,930
然后要慢慢地踩刹车
and slowly apply... the... brake.

258
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,530
搞定
Nailed it.

259
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,630
趁现在空着  能问你个问题吗
While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?

260
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,030
说
What?

261
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
你为什么在右屁股上
Why do you have the Chinese character for soup

262
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,500
纹了个中国字"汤"的纹身
tattooed on your right buttock?

263
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,200
那不是"汤"
It's not soup.

264
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,500
是"勇"
It's courage.

265
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,970
才不是
No, it isn't.

266
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,200
但我猜想  要表现出对汤的热忱
But I suppose it does take courage

267
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,030
还真是需要不少勇气
to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.

268
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,970
你怎么会看到
How did you see it?

269
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,470
你说了不看的
You said you wouldn't look.

270
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,670
不好意思
Sorry.

271
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,930
正如我所说  是英雄  就偷窥
As I told you, the hero always peeks.

272
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,460
找到了吗
Anything?

273
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,030
没有  你吃掉了最后一个布丁
No. That was the last pudding cup.

274
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,200
不
No!

275
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,500
史吉牌牛肉小吃呢(美国牛肉小吃品牌)
What about Slim Jims?

276
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,060
他刚才就着布丁吃光了  忘了吗
That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?

277
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,360
没错  太美味了
Right. That was so good!

278
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,360
甜甜肉肉的混合口感真棒
Sweety and meaty at the same time.

279
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,660
等等  你是说
Wait. Wait, wait. So you're saying

280
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,060
我们吃光食物了吗
we're out of food?

281
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,700
里面只剩下蓝色冰袋了
The only thing in here are blue ice packs.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,800
虽然深知它们有毒
I know they're poison,

283
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,760
但还是像极了美味诱人的吸的冻
but they look like big, yummy otter pops.

284
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,900
老天爷  我饿死了
Oh, God, I am so hungry.

285
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,100
我也是
Me, too.

286
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,660
再看看我们还有布丁没
Check and see if we have any more pudding.

287
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,800
好吧
Okay.

288
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,630
好吧  也没必要冲我吼吧
All right, there's no need to bark at me.

289
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,770
那位莫名暴躁的
According to the inexplicably irritable nurse

290
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,730
接待护士说
behind the desk,

291
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
你排在那个声称自己
you'll be seen after the man

292
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,400
有心脏病的男人后面
who claims to be having a heart attack,

293
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,960
但在我看来  他健康得很
but appears to be well enough

294
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,760
还能在他的iPhone上玩涂鸦跳跃呢
to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.

295
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,630
我们得先填表格
We have to fill these out.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,430
"请描述病情和伤情情况"
"Describe illness or injury."

297
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,500
肩膀脱臼
I dislocated my shoulder.

298
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,160
好吧
All right.

299
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,930
发生意外的原因
And how did the accident occur?

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
你不是已经知道了吗
You already know that.

301
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
-你目前怀有身孕吗  -没有
- Are you currently pregnant? - No.

309
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,900
确定吗  你看起来可有点肥
Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.

310
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,130
偏头痛那里改成"是"
Change migraine to yes.

311
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
你上次生理期是什么时候
"When was your last menstrual period?"

312
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,000
转下个问题
Oh. Next question.

313
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,130
我就写  “生理期中”
I'll put, "In progress."

314
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,530
好了  下面是精神疾病的问题
Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders.

315
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,360
列出所有重大行为方面的病症

316
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,430
例如沮丧  焦虑等等
"e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."

317
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,860
天哪  这些跟我这该死的肩膀
Oh, my God, what the hell does this

318
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,330
又有什么该死的关系

324
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,260
谢尔顿  谢尔顿  听我说
Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look,

325
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,630
我饱受惊吓  而且疼得厉害
I am scared and in a lot of pain.

326
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,630
可不可以请你别这么自我
Could you please take a break from being you for

327
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,560
让我缓口气  再试着...
just a minute and try being--

328
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,460
怎么说呢  安慰一下我
I don't know-- comforting?

329
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,330
抱歉
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,500
好了好了
There, there.

331
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
一切都会好起来的
Everything's going to be fine.

332
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
有我谢尔顿在
Sheldon's here.

333
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,560
谢谢  这样好多了
Thanks. That's much better.

334
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,200
我饿死啦
Oh, I'm so hungry!

335
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,660
你闭嘴吧
Will you shut up?

336
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,860
我们都饿死了
We're all hungry.

337
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,700
好了  我们的抢劫目标是
Okay, our objective is

338
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,560
东边那个童子军训练营地
the Boy Scout campsite to the east.

339
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,930
很好下手
Easy target.

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
手不能提的童军教练  加上几个童军
Big doughy scout master, couple of Cubs,

341
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,030
大多是幼童军
mostly WeBeLos.

342
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,400
具体抢啥东西呢
What kind of score we looking at?

343
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,600
热狗  面包  烤巧克力夹心饼
Hot dogs, Buns, S'mores.

344
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,160
那整个一便利商店嘛
I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.

345
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,430
好了  大家都带上手电
All right,everyone grab flashlights.

346
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,530
天哪  会是那个吗
Oh, my God, could it be?

347
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,830
太好了
Yes!

348
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,730
我妈妈在我包里放了鸡胸肉"爱心便当"
My mother put an "I love you" brisket in my backpack.

349
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,730
快  拿叉子
Quick, get forks.

350
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,130
不需要拿叉子
You don't need forks.

351
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,900
多嫩的鸡胸肉啊  用手一撕就行了
It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.

352
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
他说的没错
He's right.

353
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,860
我觉得我们好像忘了啥重要的事
I feel like we're forgetting something important.

354
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,930
我也是  但是什么捏
Me, too. But what?

355
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,960
也许是忘了整整一盒的烤土豆和胡萝卜
Maybe a Tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?

356
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,000
-太好了  -太好了
- Yes! - Yes!

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,330
记住  你刚吃了强力止痛药
Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication

358
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,030
还有肌肉松弛剂
and a muscle relaxer,

359
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,700
所以  千万别去操作重型机械
so, uh, don't operate heavy machinery.

360
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,330
小心别让自己口水噎到窒息
Try not to choke on your own drool.

361
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,930
等等  你得哄我上床睡觉啊
Wait.You have to help me get into bed.

362
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,430
谢尔顿哄我睡觉
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

363
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,130
我猜你怎么都想不到我会说这话
Bet you never thought I'd say that.

364
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
是啊
Yes.

365
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,460
你服下的药物副作用有无限可能
The charm of your drug-addled candor knows no bounds.

366
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,600
都说你跟个奇怪的机器人一样
You know, people think you're this weird robot man

367
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,060
一直都很烦人  说得一点没错
who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are.

368
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,530
但现在你就像电影《瓦力》里结局那样
But then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end.

369
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
充满了爱心
You're so full of love,

370
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,000
简直能拯救整个一株植物
and you can save a plant

371
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,730
拯救那些陷入滑滑椅不能自拔的肥佬
and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.

372
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,460
你这个比喻相当不伦不类
That's a fairly labored metaphor,

373
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,900
不过对这故事隐含的观点  我很欣赏
but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

374
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,130
唱"乖乖猫"给我听
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

375
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,760
"乖乖猫"是唱给生病的人的
"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.

376
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,000
你又没生病
You're not sick.

377
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,300
我受伤了还服了药  就相当于生病
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

378
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,600
乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

379
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,900
等等
Wait, wait.

380
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
我们来唱和声吧
Let's sing it as a round.

381
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,300
我来起头
I'll start.

382
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,100
乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

383
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,430
我唱到这儿你该加进来唱了
So, that's where you come in.

384
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,830
我再从头唱起
I'll start over.

385
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,000
乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

386
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,060
谢尔顿  我有一整晚跟你耗哦
I've got all night, Sheldon.

387
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,460
乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

388
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,800
乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

389
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,930
快乐猫  瞌睡猫
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,300
快乐猫  瞌睡猫
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

391
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
呜  呜  呜[猫满足时呜呜的叫声]
Purr, purr, purr

392
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,460
呜  呜  呜
Purr, purr, purr.

393
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,760
第二天早上  他醒了过来
...And the next morning when he woke up,

394
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,130
翻了个身  他意识到...
he rolled over and realized...

395
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,730
那是她表妹
...she was his cousin.

396
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,260
还是不好笑
That's still not funny.

397
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,530
还是不好笑
That's still not funny.

398
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,000
再说她是我的远房表妹
And she was my second cousin.

399
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,630
再说她是我的远房表妹
And she was my second cousin.

400
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,200
你真是脑残
You're a real douche.

401
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,660
随你说好了  反正你跟自个儿表妹上床了
Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
