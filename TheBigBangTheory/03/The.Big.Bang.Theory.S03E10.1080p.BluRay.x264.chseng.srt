1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,700
莱纳德  看我的
Hey, Leonard, check this out.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,230
莱纳德  她又来了
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,860
我觉得你调戏食物会让谢尔顿郁闷
I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,300
不  应该是她从碗里随便拿起食物
No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,830
而不顾还要平均分配的问题时
from the containers without regard

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,200
让谢尔顿很郁闷
for its equitable distribution.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,230
这就是印度有饥荒的根本原因
This is essentially why you have famine in India.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
你要我吐回去吗
You want me to put it back?

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,560
莱纳德
Leonard.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,500
当你调戏谢尔顿时会让谢尔顿郁闷
It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,930
怎么样啊  我亲爱的呆瓜们
What's up, my nerdizzles?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,260
拉杰  谢尔顿
Raj, Sheldon,

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,200
我想将我的女朋友伯纳黛特引见与你们
I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,300
你好  莱纳德  佩妮
Hello. Leonard, Penny,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
你们认识我的女友伯纳黛特的
you know my girlfriend Bernadette.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,360
-嗯  -嗨
- Yeah.  - Hey.

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,630
伯纳黛特  跟呆瓜们说绝对的
Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,160
我不能这么说
I don't think I can.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,860
我没有霍华德那种街头痞子风
I don't have Howard's street cred.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
我希望这没造成问题
I hope it's all right--

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,300
我跟我的女朋友伯纳黛特说
I told my girlfriend Bernadette

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,830
她可以跟我们共进晚餐
she could join us for dinner.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,830
当然可以  人多乐趣多
Sure. The more, the merrier.

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,960
不对  这是个错误的对等关系
Wa-- no, that's a false equivalency.

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,500
人多不等于乐趣多
More does not equal merry.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
如果这公寓里现在有两千人
If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now,

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,560
那我们会很开心吗  不  我们会窒息而死
would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,760
-谢尔顿  -别郁闷我
- Sheldon...  - Don't "Sheldon" me.

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,100
我们定的是五人份  不是六人
We ordered for five people, not six.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,630
来不  没事儿的
Oh, come on, it's fine.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,060
我们全部摊在桌上分享就好  就像家庭聚餐式的
We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,430
噢  那是  当我们家庭聚餐时
Oh, sure. And while we're at it,

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,200
为什么不把手背到背后
why don't we put our hands behind our backs,

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,660
来个老式的进食大赛呢
have an old-fashioned eating contest?

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,060
放轻松  没事儿的
Relax, it'll be fine.

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,130
做吧  你们
Sit down, you guys.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,600
别  别  别
No! No! No!

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,500
怎么了
What?!

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,260
对了  你不能坐那儿
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,200
为什么不能
Why not?

41
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,760
那是谢尔顿的专属座位
That's where Sheldon sits.

42
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,300
他不能坐其他地方吗
He can't sit somewhere else?

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,460
不  不  不  你看啊  在冬天呢
No, no, no-- you see, in the winter,

44
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,830
这个座位与暖气片的距离足够让他保持温暖
that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm,

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,260
但又不会太近以至于出汗
yet not so close that he sweats.

46
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,260
而在夏天  这个位置又正好处在
In the summer, it's directly in the path of

47
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,630
由这个和那个窗口之间对流所产生的微风之中
a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.

48
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,960
这儿的角度并不是直接面朝电视
It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct,

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,430
所以他还能跟所有人交谈
so he can still talk to everybody,

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,200
同时又不会太偏导致画面失真
yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,500
看来你还是有那么点指望的嘛
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

52
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,710
生活大爆炸第三季第十集

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
喔  我喜欢你的鞋子
Ooh, I love your shoes.

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,560
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,760
很可爱  不是吗
They are cute, aren't they?

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,660
-你在哪儿买到的  -实惠鞋店
- Where'd you get them?  - Shoes for Less.

57
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,100
我正有此意要去那儿
I've been meaning to go over there.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,300
东西很多  价格也便宜
Oh, great selection, great prices.

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,330
我娘说的对  确实有地狱
My mother was right. Hell is real.

60
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,500
别这样  谢尔顿
Come on, Sheldon.

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
让妇女们聊吧
Let the womenfolk chat.

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,300
妇女
Womenfolk?

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,730
少女
Gals?

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,860
妞儿
Chicks?

65
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,960
有子宫的美国人
Utero-Americans?

66
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,230
吃你的饭吧
Just eat your dinner.

67
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,960
别太跟他较真儿
Don't take him too seriously.

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,730
他说的很多话本是故意为了幽默一下的
A lot of what he says is intended as humor.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
是啊  但我一点也不觉得有趣
Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,660
我也是  但是我一笑他就灿烂了
Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,600
霍华德  不能让她跑了
Howard, never let her go.

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,460
莱纳德  霍华德说你正在进行
So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on

73
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,160
一些量子力学的基本测试
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

74
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,200
没错
I am.

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,730
你对物理感兴趣吗
Are you interested in physics?

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,100
我觉得很很吸引人
Oh, I find it fascinating.

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,530
如果我没有选择微生物学的话
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,260
我也许就会进军物理了
I probably would have gone into physics.

79
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,200
或者冰舞
Or ice dancing.

80
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,360
事实上  我对于阿哈伦诺夫-博姆的
Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm

81
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,860
量子干涉效应实验已经到达了一个很有趣的阶段
quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point.

82
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,360
现在  我们正在测试基于电势的
Right now, we're testing the phase shift

83
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,760
相位偏移
due to an electric potential.

84
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,900
真是太棒了
That's amazing.

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
那是  莱纳德的工作几乎就跟
Yes. Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

86
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,230
三年级小学生用湿毛巾种青豆一样棒
as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,660
虽然我很欣赏你的  "喔  又损人了"
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

88
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,400
但你那温湿的口气飘进我的耳中令我很不舒服
I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.

89
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,530
你会用
Are you going to try

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
穿隧结合来设定电压吗
to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?

91
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,900
是的
Yes, I am.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,930
你要看我笔记本上的模拟情况吗
You want to see a simulation on my laptop?

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,460
好啊  给我看看
Oh, yeah, show me.

94
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,830
在微生物学中  我做过的最激动人心的事情
In microbiology, the most exciting thing

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,060
也就是跟酵母玩玩
I get to work with is yeast.

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,900
霍华德
Howard?

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,930
怎么了
Yeah?

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,630
你的鞋子真漂亮
Your shoes are delightful.

99
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,360
你在哪儿买的
Where did you get them?

100
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,260
什么
What?

101
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,600
逗你玩儿  我才不关心呢
Bazinga. I don't care.

102
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,100
哈  吃灰吧你
Ha! Eat my dust,

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
万年不变的古板水管工
racially stereotypical plumber.

104
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,830
这不公平
That's not fair.

105
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,560
我被一棵树卡住了
I got stuck behind a tree.

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,460
外加一只母牛和企鹅
And a cow and a penguin.

107
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,400
认了吧  兄弟
Face it, dude,

108
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,900
不管是现实的车还是虚拟的卡通车
whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car,

109
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,200
你都不能驾驭
you can't drive.

110
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,960
只需要点练习而已
Just need a little more practice.

111
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,430
你需要的是金手指  驾驶技巧和一盏神灯
What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,930
来帮马里奥赛车小废柴实现愿望
who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.

113
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,000
谢尔顿  我能跟你说两句话吗
Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,630
这跟鞋没关系  对吧
It's not about shoes, is it?

115
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,800
我不想再聊鞋子了
I don't think I could go through that again.

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,300
跟鞋子无关
It's not about shoes.

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
那就说吧
Then speak.

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,300
我们能私下谈吗
Um, actually, can we do it in private?

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,130
好吧
All right.

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,660
走开
Go away.

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,100
我知道很无礼  但她要私下谈
I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,230
谢谢  拉杰
Thanks, Raj.

123
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,030
事情是这样的
Okay, so here's the thing:

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,660
我想请你教我一点物理学
I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?

125
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,400
一点物理学
A little physics?

126
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,800
没有这个说法
There's no such thing.

127
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,800
物理学包含整个宇宙
Physics encompasses the entire universe,

128
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,400
从量子粒子到超新星
from quantum particles to supernovas,

129
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,660
从自旋电子到旋转星系
from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.

130
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,660
行
Yeah, okay, cool.

131
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,900
不用说得像广播特别报导一样
I don't need the PBS special.

132
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,330
只要了解到
I just want to know enough

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,430
能和莱纳德谈他的工作就行
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,860
就像伯纳黛特那样
You know, like Bernadette does.

135
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,460
干嘛不叫莱纳德教你
Why can't Leonard teach you?

136
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,000
我想给他个惊喜
'Cause I want to surprise him.

137
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,100
就不能以其他方式给他惊喜吗
Can't you surprise him in some other way?

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,100
比如  你要是打扫一下房间
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,330
我肯定他又惊又喜
if you cleaned your apartment.

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
拜托  谢尔顿  这对我很重要
Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,130
佩妮
Penny,

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,530
教你可是艰巨的任务
this would be a massive undertaking,

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
我的时间既有限又宝贵呢
and my time is both limited and valuable.

144
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,900
你整天都坐着玩电子游戏呢
You're sitting here playing video games all day.

145
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,460
被你说中了
Okay, point.

146
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,800
你学了哪些基础知识
What sort of foundation do you have?

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,230
学校教过什么科学课吗
Did you take any science classes in school?

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,400
有  我做过青蛙的实验
Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

149
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,230
青蛙的实验
The one with the frogs.

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,630
对  其实挺好玩的
Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool.

151
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,730
很多女生都吐了  但我把小青蛙像鹿一样宰了
A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,330
抱歉  佩妮
I'm sorry, Penny.

153
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
恕我无能为力
I don't think so.

154
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,860
别这样嘛
Oh, come on!

155
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,660
你这么聪明  就当挑战一下
A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge.

156
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,160
当成实验来做嘛
You can make it like an experiment.

157
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,560
有意思
Interesting.

158
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,900
既然别人能教
I suppose if someone could teach sign language

159
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,830
KoKo大猩猩学手语
to KoKo the gorilla...

160
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,260
我也能教你基本物理学
I could teach you some rudimentary physics.

161
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,260
太好了
Great!

162
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,500
虽然有点侮辱人  但很好
It's a little insulting, but great.

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,500
我就做KoKo吧
I'll be KoKo.

164
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,700
不见得吧
Not likely.

165
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,630
KoKo学会了超过两千个单词
KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words,

166
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,330
没有一个跟鞋子有关呢
not one of which had anything to do with shoes.

167
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
伙计们好
Hey, fellas.

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,030
这是在下的女友伯纳黛特
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

169
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,760
在下的女友伯纳黛特
My girlfriend Bernadette.

170
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,230
他们都是谁
Who are all those people?

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,400
不知道
Have no idea.

172
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,430
好啊  莱纳德
Hey, Leonard.

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,860
好  瞧瞧
Hi. Hey, look,

174
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,530
这不是霍华德的女友伯纳黛特嘛
it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.

175
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,030
带这位小美人逛逛这老盐矿
Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.

176
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,600
他说的不是盐矿
He doesn't mean salt mines.

177
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,260
他说的是工作地点
He means where he works.

178
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,760
对  我知道
Yeah, no, I got it.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,530
你的实验进展如何
So, how's your experiment going?

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,860
很顺利
Ah, terrific.

181
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,260
我们正在准备电子加速器
We're getting the electron accelerator set up.

182
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,200
后天就能准备好
We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.

183
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,160
真想见识一下
Boy, I'd love to see that.

184
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,300
欢迎你来
You're welcome to come.

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,460
真的吗  太好了
Really? Oh, that'd be great.

186
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,260
多兴奋啊
How exciting is that?

187
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,160
简直就像七月过光明节一样
Like Hanukkah in July.

188
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,230
七月有光明节吗
Do they have that?

189
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,730
没有
No.

190
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,660
又被你糊弄了
You got me again.

191
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,100
这不是脱脂酸奶
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

192
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,800
简直全是脂肪
This is fatty fat fat.

193
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,130
失陪一下
Excuse me.

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,460
心肝儿  能帮我拿张餐巾吗
Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?

195
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,460
-当然可以  -谢谢  宝贝
- Sure. - Thanks, honey.

196
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,860
说  你打什么如意算盘
All right, what is your deal?

197
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,230
你说什么
Excuse me?

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
邀请我女朋友
Inviting my girlfriend

199
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
去看你的电子加速器
to come see your electron accelerator?

200
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,630
怎么了
Yeah? So?

201
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,430
你真有两下子
You really are a piece of work.

202
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,560
舞会皇后
It's not enough

203
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,430
被你弄到手还不满意
you get the prom queen, you have to get

204
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
你还想抢走陪衬头牌呢
the head of the decorating committee, too?

205
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,700
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,460
别跟我装无辜
Don't play innocent with me.

207
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,930
用神奇实验设备勾引女人
I practically invented

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,430
这招是我发明的
using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

209
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
成功过吗
Has it ever worked?

210
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,560
目前没有  重点不是这个
Not so far, but that's not the point!

211
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,760
霍华德  别紧张
Howard, relax.

212
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,500
我对你女朋友没兴趣
I'm not interested in your girlfriend.

213
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
最好如此
I hope not.

214
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,830
你不会想跟我瞎搅和
Because you don't want to mess with me.

215
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,960
我可是疯子
I'm crazy.

216
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,060
我相信你
I believe you.

217
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,800
实验日志  第一篇
Research journal, entry one.

218
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,400
我准备开展
I'm about to embark on one of

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,730
科学生涯中的巨大挑战之一
the great challenges of my scientific career:

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,430
教佩妮物理学
teaching Penny physics.

221
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,830
我称之为大猩猩工程
I'm calling it Project Gorilla.

222
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,730
好啊  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
请进  坐吧
Come in. Take a seat.

224
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,830
实验目标已到
Subject has arrived.

225
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,160
我亲切地欢迎她
I've extended a friendly casual greeting.

226
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,760
准备好开始了吗
Ready to get started?

227
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,030
稍等
One moment.

228
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,700
目标气色很好  也很热情
Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
显然  无知是福
Apparently, ignorance is bliss.

230
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,660
好吧  我们开始
All right, let us begin.

231
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,330
你的笔记本呢
Where's your notebook?

232
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
我没笔记本
Um, I don't have one.

233
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,900
那你咋记笔记
How are you going to take notes without a notebook?

234
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,800
还得记笔记吗
I have to take notes?

235
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,100
不然你怎么考试
How else are you gonna study for the tests?

236
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,460
最好还要考试吗
There's gonna be a test?

237
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,960
可不止一次考试
Test-sss.

238
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,430
给
Here.

239
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,560
这是大学规定
It's college-ruled.

240
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,300
希望没吓着你
I hope that's not too intimidating.

241
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,360
多谢你的体贴
Thank you.

242
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,360
不客气
You're welcome.

243
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,260
现在开始讲物理学入门
Now, Introduction to Physics.

244
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,130
什么是物理
What is physics?

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,130
物理这个词来源于古希腊语中的"physika"
Physics comes from the ancient Greek word "physika."

246
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,530
你该记笔记了
It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes.

247
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,860
"Physika"是指自然科学
"Physika" means the science of natural things.

248
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,000
而就在那遥远的古希腊  我们的旅程开始了
And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.

249
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,630
-靠  古希腊  -嘘
- Ancient Greece?!  - Hush.

250
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
有问题  先举手
If you have questions, raise your hand.

251
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,460
那是在大约公元前600年的一个仲夏夜
It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.

252
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,530
当你从集市[古希腊圣贤集会所]购物归来
You've finished your shopping at the local market, or Agora...

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
抬头仰望夜空
...And you look up at the night sky.

254
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,100
突然  你发现星星在游弋
There you notice some of the stars seem to move,

255
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,730
于是  你将他们命名为"行星"或"漫游者"
So you name them "planetes," or "wanderer".

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,930
佩妮同学  有问题吗
Yes, Penny?

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,160
这和莱纳德的研究有什么关系
Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?

258
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,600
这是一个历时2600年的旅程
This is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey

259
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,560
我们慢慢讲  不急
We're going to take together

260
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,830
追溯到古希腊
From the ancient Greeks

261
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,400
从艾萨克·牛顿到尼尔斯·玻尔[原子理论和量子力学的创始人]
Through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

262
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,100
再到埃尔文·薛定谔[创立波动力学]
To Erwin Schrodinger

263
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,700
再到荷兰研究学派
To the Dutch researchers

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
莱纳德近来就在重复他们的研究呢
That Leonard is currently ripping off.

265
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,360
居然有2600年
2,600 years?

266
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,560
没错  可能有些许误差
Yeah, give or take.

267
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,960
正如我之前所说  在那遥远的古希腊
As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening

268
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,500
一个氤氲的仲夏夜
In ancient Greece...

269
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
怎么了  佩妮同学
Yes, Penny?

270
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,200
我要去洗手间
I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,460
你就不能憋一下吗
Can't you hold it?

272
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,130
我可憋不了2600年
Not for 2,600 years.

273
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,130
大猩猩实验  日志2
Project Gorilla, entry two.

274
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
我被榨干了
I am exhausted.

275
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,260
-霍华德  -怎么
- Howard?  - Huh?

276
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,000
这个要从前面解开的
It unhooks in the front.

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,530
难怪啊
Oh, that explains a lot.

278
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
霍华德  我回来了
Howard, I'm home!

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,370
整栋楼都听到了
Of course.

280
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,170
老年健身取消了
Senior fitness was cancelled.

281
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,270
我发现原来还真会忘了怎么骑车
It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.

282
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,070
我是没啥  但山姆·哈普蒂安摔了个嘴啃泥
I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

283
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,440
太棒了  娘
That's great, Ma!

284
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,200
80多的亚美尼亚老人摔断了半边下巴
What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man

285
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,940
有什么可棒的
With half his chin scraped off?!

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
我想我得走了
I guess I should go.

287
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,870
不  别动
No, no, don't move.

288
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,970
娘  晚饭我想吃炖羊肉
Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?

289
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,440
炖羊肉  那我还得去超市买
Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,700
帮帮忙啦
Please?

291
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,740
我真的很想吃嘛
I got a real hankering.

292
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,800
噢  我最疼我家小屁脸宝贝了
Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face.

293
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,940
我很快回来
I'll be back soon.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
多谢啦  娘
Thanks, Ma.

295
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,270
你要家常豌豆还是拉素豌豆[豌豆的一种]
Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?

296
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,600
平时不都是加拉素豌豆的吗
Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!

297
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,570
好吧  你总是说得有理
You're right! When you're right, you're right!

298
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,800
如果拉素豌豆卖完了咋办
What if they're out of the Le Seur?

299
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,870
那就买家常的啊
Then get the regular!

300
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,240
好吧  你别冲我吼啊
All right! You don't have to yell!

301
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,970
抱歉
Sorry about that.

302
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,170
我来调成震动
Let me just put that on vibrate.

303
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,670
我早就调好啦
I'm already on vibrate.

304
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,470
这个我可听懂了
You know, that one I got.

305
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,470
霍华德  你和莱纳德说起我什么了吗
Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,870
什么意思
Uh, what do you mean?

307
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,000
他说我要是明天去看他的实验
He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow

308
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,800
可能你会感觉不好
It might weird you out.

309
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,540
是吗  他这样说吗
Really? He said that?

310
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,540
你不是在吃莱纳德的醋吧
You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,670
我  才没有呢
Me? No.

312
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,100
我只是说  在没和别人商量的情况下
I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate

313
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,900
邀请别人的女友去看他的实验
To be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment

314
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,570
这样有点不太合适
Without first discussing it with said man.

315
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,000
你的意思是  我和莱纳德一起还要经过同意
Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?

316
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,940
我可没这么说
I didn't say anything like that.

317
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,340
我是说莱纳德必须经过我同意
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

318
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,870
拜托  我可不想和我娘共进炖羊肉啊
Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother.

319
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,970
可恶  我差点就解开bra了
Damn, I was this close on the bra.

320
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,270
记住  牛顿发现亚里士多德的理论是错的
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong

321
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,640
运动不需要靠力来维持
And force was not necessary to maintain motion.

322
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,770
所以  加上a = 9.8平方米每秒
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared

323
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,700
我们能得到
As "A" and we get

324
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,370
万有引力乘以质量
Force-- Earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters

325
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,100
等于9.8米每秒的平方
Per second per second.

326
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,600
从而得到ma = mg
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

327
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,340
我们可以推算出什么
And what do we know from this?

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,900
我们能推算出
Uh, we know that...

329
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,540
牛顿真是个聪明绝顶的小甜饼
...Newton was a really smart cookie.

330
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,070
哇  所以才有了牛顿打滚吗[一种点心  很像驴打滚]
Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

331
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,100
不  牛顿打滚得名于马萨诸塞州的一个小镇
No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.

332
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,770
-别光顾着记这个啊  -抱歉
- Don't write that down!  - Sorry.

333
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,340
好  如果ma = mg  我们可以推算出什么
Now, if "ma" equals "mg," what does that imply?

334
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
我不知道
I don't know.

335
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,070
你怎么可以不知道
How can you not know?

336
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,700
我都告诉你了啊
I just told you.

337
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,170
你最近脑子被敲过了吗
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

338
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,100
你这也太刻薄了吧
Hey! You don't have to be so mean!

339
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,800
你最近脑子被敲过了吗
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

341
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,170
-你这个老师真是烂透了  -是吗
- No, you just suck at teaching.  - Really?

342
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
你觉得这两种解释哪个更靠谱点呢
Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?

343
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,700
天哪
Oh, God...

344
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,770
谢尔顿  我也很想听懂
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

345
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,170
但你说得太快了
but you're going too fast.

346
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,270
能不能倒回去一点
Can you just back up a little bit?

347
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,640
好吧
All right.

348
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,100
在那个古希腊的仲夏夜
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

349
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,770
别倒回那么多
Not that far back!

350
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,370
好吧
Okay!

351
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,540
你到底哪点开始听不懂的
At what point did you begin to feel lost?

352
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
我不知道
I don't know.

353
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,670
我们抬头仰望星空是在哪里
Where were we looking up at the night sky?

354
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,940
-希腊  -见鬼
- Greece. - Damn it!

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,140
用不着灰心
There's no need to get frustrated.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,900
总有人学得快  有人学得慢
People learn at different rates.

357
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,770
不像漂浮在真空中的物体  在那里
Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which...?

358
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,740
ma=mg
"ma" equals "mg"...?

359
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,940
平方?
Squared?

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,340
不对
No.

361
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,800
亚里斯多德
Aristotle?

362
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,300
不对
No.

363
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,370
等于五
Five?

364
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,000
那我不知道了
Then I don't know.

365
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,340
你哭什么
Why are you crying?

366
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,840
我哭我自己蠢啊
Because I'm stupid!

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
那也没理由哭啊
That's no reason to cry.

368
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,770
人只有悲伤的时候才该哭
One cries because one is sad.

369
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,140
比如说  其他人都太蠢我感到悲伤
For example, I cry because others are stupid

370
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,170
所以我才哭
and it makes me sad.

371
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,640
好了  能不能先不扯这些题外话
Okay, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff

372
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,500
就告诉我莱纳德平常在做的那些
and can you just tell me what Leonard does?

373
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,100
好吧
All right.

374
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,740
莱纳德正致力于研究出为何亚原子粒子
Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles

375
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
会像现在这样运动
move the way they do.

376
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,940
真的  就这样
Really? That's it?

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
这听起来并不是很复杂嘛
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

378
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,070
是不复杂
It's not.

379
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,240
所以莱纳德才干这个
That's why Leonard does it.

380
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,840
我只有一个问题
Okay, I just have one question.

381
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,600
亚原子粒子  到底是什么
What exactly are sub-atomic particles?

382
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,540
问得好
A good question.

383
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
谢谢
Thank you.

384
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,440
要回答这个问题  我们首先必须自问
And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves:

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,840
物理是什么
"What is physics?"

386
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
又绕回来了
Oh, balls.

387
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,600
在那个古希腊的仲夏夜
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

388
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,570
我有事要找你算账
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

389
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
这回我又怎么了
What did I do now?

390
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,700
我和伯纳黛特正要做爱做的事  被你的短信搅了
I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.

391
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,800
什么
What?!

392
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,570
我们都脱光光了  正要水乳交融的时候...
We were completely naked, about to devour each other when,

393
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,140
你发短信告诉她  我对她跟你出来有意见
you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.

394
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,440
你确实对她跟我出来有意见
You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.

395
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,400
对  但你不该对她说的
Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.

396
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,000
那我该跟她怎么说
What was I supposed to tell her?

397
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,100
我不知道  说些别让我显得
I don't know. Something that doesn't make me come off

398
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,570
猥琐又吃醋的脑残的话
as a petty, jealous douche.

399
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,800
那该怎么说才好
And what would that be?

400
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,970
拜托  我得帮你想好一切吗
Come on, do I have to think of everything?

401
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
你好  莱纳德
Hey, Leonard.

402
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,900
我来太晚了吗  还能看实验不
Am I too late to see the experiment?

403
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,640
你来这干嘛
What are you doing here?

404
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
跟你一样
Same thing you're doing here.

405
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,640
来看莱纳德的实验
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

406
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,970
才怪
No, you didn't.

407
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,700
你说过莱纳德的实验很蠢
You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.

408
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,100
你跟她说我的实验很蠢
You told her my experiment was stupid?

409
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,470
我只是复述谢尔顿的话
I was just repeating what Sheldon said.

410
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,340
我们别再转移话题了吧
Let's not get off topic.

411
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,770
伯纳黛特  我得跟你道歉
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

412
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,440
我错了  不该对你跟谁交友指手划脚的
I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.

413
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
我该留你们俩独处吗
Should I, um, leave you two alone?

414
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,300
不用  莱纳德  你也该听听
No, Leonard, you should hear this.

415
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,270
好  反正我也没想走
Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

416
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,600
我知道我看上去自信满满  老于世故  但
Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but...

417
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,840
其实我并不是这样的
the truth is I'm not.

418
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,840
好雷人
We're shocked.

419
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,040
所以我容易感到受到其他人的威胁
Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.

420
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,340
或噪音  或围观群众
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

421
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,540
但我已经知道  这样做有多蠢
But I now realize how foolish that is.

422
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,970
他有次就因为头卡在毛衣里
He had a panic attack once

423
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,200
就恐慌了
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

424
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,470
那可是件高领套头毛衣
It was a full turtleneck.

425
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,570
你为什么不帮帮我
Why aren't you helping me?

426
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,200
我不知道
I don't know.

427
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,200
也许因为  我疯了
Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

428
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,500
伯纳黛特  求你再给我一次机会吧
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.

429
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,170
你怎么想  莱纳德
What do you think, Leonard?

430
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
我该再给他一次机会吗
Should I give him another chance?

431
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,400
你自己做主
It's up to you.

432
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,240
反正他也没说你的实验蠢
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

433
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
过来吧  屁屁脸
Come here, tushy face.

434
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,170
屁屁脸
"Tushy face."

435
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,970
这话一定得立马推上微博
That is going on Twitter right now.

436
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,900
拉杰  你真该去看看莱纳德的实验
Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.

437
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,500
电子束发射后产生的干涉图样
The interference pattern was so cool

438
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,140
实在太酷了
when the electron beam was on.

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,570
很高兴你喜欢
Glad you enjoyed it.

440
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,600
多数人对我的工作都不那么感兴趣
Most people aren't that interested in what I do.

441
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,940
莱纳德  其实你这么说不对
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
事实上  最近我一直在琢磨
In fact, recently I've been thinking that

443
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,500
考虑到你实验中的各项参数
given the parameters of your experiment,

444
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,400
通过你那纳米级装备的螺线管
the transport of electrons through the aperture

445
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,670
所进行的电子干涉实验
of the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different

446
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,770
跟荷兰已成功进行的实验  没有任何不同
than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.

447
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,400
他们通过螺线管干涉电子
Their observed phase shift

448
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,440
观测到的周相移动
in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring

449
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,040
已成功地用电子模拟的形式证明了
already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue

450
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,640
阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆的量子干涉效应
of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect.

451
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,900
就这样  我也就知道这些
That's it. That's all I know.

452
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,340
等等还有
Oh, wait...!

453
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,100
"牛顿打滚"是以马萨诸塞一城市命名的
Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts,

454
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,470
而不是那科学家
not the scientist.
