1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,890
谢尔顿  你错了
Sheldon, you're wrong.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,300
金刚狼出生时没有骨爪
Wolverine was not born with bone claws.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,020
霍华德
Howard,

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,720
你知道我是个聪明绝顶的人
you know me to be a very smart man.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,720
我要是错了  我能不知道吗
Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,620
-首先...  -算了吧
- Okay, first of all... - Give it up, dude.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,150
别跟疯子争辩了
You're arguing with a crazy person.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,550
我不是疯子
I'm not crazy.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,150
我妈妈带我去检测过
My mother had me tested.

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,550
-伙计们  -你来这干嘛
- Hey, guys. - What are you doing here?

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,450
你说呢  今晚是新漫画书之夜啊
What do you mean? It's new comic book night.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,450
鉴于你和佩妮终于勾搭上了
Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,120
我们以为你们会来个光溜溜之夜呢
you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,950
生活并非只有性爱  拉杰
There's more to life than sex, Raj.

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,150
谁认同"莱佩情24小时内熄火"
Okay, who had "Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours"?

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,350
我
I did.

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,020
什么都没熄火
Nothing flamed out.

18
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,020
我们没必要夜夜春宵
We don't have to have sex every night, you know.

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,020
是没必要  但强烈推荐啊
You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,350
在机遇之窗猛然关闭之前
Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,490
好好利用这段绝佳时期
before it slams shut on your little dinky.

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,550
这不是机遇的问题
It's not a matter of opptunity.

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,890
我们要了解对方
We're getting to know each other.

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,490
有学习的曲折过程
There's a learning curve.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,590
有什么可学的
What's there to learn?

26
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,150
脱光光  互相猥亵对方
You get naked, do nasty things to each other,

27
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,020
然后某人做做炒蛋和香肠
then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami.

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,250
小菜一碟
Easy peasy.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,590
或许莱纳德
Perhaps what Leonard

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,220
间接所指的
is oblique referring to

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,650
是性功能障碍吧
is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,150
谁认同"小莱软趴了"
Okay, who had "Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

33
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,690
真聪明  虽然这种委婉表达
Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism

34
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,220
男性性器官充血不足的说法过时了
for insufficient blood flow the male sex organ.

35
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,590
不是那么回事
Nothing like that happened, all right?

36
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,720
那次做爱...挺好
The sex was... just fine.

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,750
挺好
Just fine?

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,890
《哈利·波特》第4部也"挺好"
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was "just fine."

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,850
我没说它很差
I'm not saying it was bad.

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,520
我只是说...不是非常好
I'm just saying it... wasn't great.

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,650
你说的"不是非常好"
Okay, when you say "it wasn'great,"

42
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,920
是指你们都这么认为吗
do you mean for both of you?

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,920
我们完全可以认为她觉得不好
Because we can totally see it not being great for her.

44
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,450
-对吧  -没错
- Am I right? - Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,120
说实话  我想我们都有点...
To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little...

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,190
我不知道
I don't know.

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,590
沮丧  失望
Disappointed? Let down?

48
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,650
羞愧  恐惧  厌恶
Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

49
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,920
我只觉得跟梦想中的不一样
All I know is, it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.

50
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,720
真正做爱跟我梦想中的从来都不一样
Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.

51
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,890
那是因为在梦中
That's because in your dreams,

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,490
你是半人马
you're a horse from the waist down.

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,420
打扰了  《金刚狼前传》
Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin.

54
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,450
迷你剧2  第22页
Miniseries issue two, page 22.

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,390
伸缩自如的骨爪
Retractable bone claws.

56
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,720
你们要是能少花点时间在性上
If you people spent less time thinking about sex

57
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,620
多花点时间在漫画书上
and more time concentrating on comic books,

58
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,820
我们就能减少相当多的尴尬时刻了
we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
生活大爆炸第三季第二集

60
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,170
谢尔顿  吃饭啦
Sheldon, dinner's here.

61
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,100
唐杜里膳宫?
Tandoori Palace?

62
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,700
不  我们去了家新餐馆
No, we went somewhere new.

63
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,970
你们是在嘲笑我是吗
You're good naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?

64
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,100
没有  看  孟买膳宫
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,330
为什么
Why?

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,070
为什么要改变
Why would we change?

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,570
已经有个完美的膳宫了
We had a perfectly good palace.

68
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,530
唐杜里膳宫就是我们的御膳房
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

69
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,170
相信我  这个也挺好
Trust me, this will be just fine.

70
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,400
你可是"挺好"的
You are the authority

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,330
权威代表
on "just fine."

72
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,230
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,130
就是"不差  也不好"
It's actually "Not bad, but not great".

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,130
他们在说什么
What are they talking about?

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,900
-我不知道  -我知道
- I don't know. - I know.

76
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,200
我相信你已发现
As I'm sure you're aware...

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
哒哒哒哒哒哒
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

78
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,490
如果你用的是莫尔斯电码
If that's Morse code,

79
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,470
未免太没水平了
That's terrible.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,130
言归正传  你和莱纳德
As I was saying, you and Leonard had

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,630
的性爱比较失望
a disappointing sexual encounter.

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,770
今天傍晚
Earlier this evening,

83
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,930
莱纳德将其描述为"挺好"
Leonard characterized as "just fine."

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
所以你看到的只是
So what you're seeing here is a continuation

85
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,630
嘲笑的后续篇
of the mocking that followed.

86
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,470
行啊
Okay, yeah, well,

87
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,170
我去其他地方吃饭吧
I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere.

88
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,330
说不定去一架要撞山的飞机上
Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.

89
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,400
佩妮  等等
Penny, wait.

90
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,370
你有毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,170
我感觉自己貌似说过分了
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.

92
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,700
-对  你...  -别告诉他
- Yeah, you... - No, don't tell him.

93
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,930
看他能不能弄懂
Let's see if he can figure it out.

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,470
简直羞死人了
Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

95
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,670
别生气嘛
Please don't be mad.

96
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,930
你跟他们说了什么
What did you tell them?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,770
没什么  就说昨晚的事挺好
Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.

98
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,170
挺好?  你说挺好?
Fine? You said it was fine?

99
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,370
这个词很好啊
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

100
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,200
放在"酒"和"餐"前面
You put it in front of "wine" or "dining,"

101
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,600
效果不是很好嘛
and you've really got something.

102
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,970
我想问问你
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

103
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,700
你觉得昨晚怎么样
How was last night for you?

104
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,530
我觉得...还行
It was... okay.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
还行?
Okay?

106
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,970
这个词很好啊
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

107
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,000
放在"不错"前面
I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"

108
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,830
效果也很好啊
And you really got something.

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,700
算了  别小题大做了
All right, look, let's not overreact, you know.

110
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,130
很多情侣都需要时间
For a lot of couples, it takes time

111
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,730
才能了解彼此的节奏
to get to know each other's rhythms.

112
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,870
明白对方的喜好
Learn what the other person was and likes.

113
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,830
这么说你以前有过经验?
So, you've been through this before?

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,200
没有
No.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
行啊
Okay-dokay.

116
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,870
我觉得这件事
You know, I think this is one of those things where

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,430
越讨论只会越糟糕
talking about it is not going to make it better.

118
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,530
喝一杯吗
Want a glass of wine?

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,830
-正合我意  -好
So much. Okay

120
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,700
我们昨晚就该这样嘛
See, we should've done this last night.

121
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,630
喝点小酒  刺激刺激
You know, have a little wine, take the edge off.

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,430
事实上  酒精会抑制神经细胞的电传导
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction

123
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,300
并会刺激感受器重新摄取抑制性神经递质
in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,570
比如伽马氨基丁酸
of inhibitory neurotranmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

125
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,500
闭嘴  喝酒就是
Don't talk, just drink.

126
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,530
不  你搞错了
No, you're misunderstanding.

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,930
谢夏不是真的女神(犹太人用以称呼非犹太的女人)
A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
我们不用向她们祈祷
And we don't pray to them.

129
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,230
我们在她们身上祈祷
We prey on them.

130
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,770
管他呢  兄弟
Whatever, dude.

131
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,570
关键在于  莱纳德有他的女人而你没有
The point is, Leonard's got one and you don't.

132
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,600
我想到了
Is this it

133
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,530
当着莱纳德和佩妮的面
It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life

134
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,030
谈论他们的性生活是不合适的
in front of Leonard and Penny.

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,570
太棒了
Oh, good!

136
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,300
终于可以吃饭了
Now I can eat.

137
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,500
啥东西
What's that?

138
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,000
-好像是个蟋蟀  -等下
Sounds like a cricket. Hang on.

139
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,100
根据每分钟的鸣叫次数
Based on the number of chirps per minute

140
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,530
并结合房间的环境温度
and the ambient temperature in this room,

141
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,630
这是一只雪树蟋蟀
it is a snowy tree cricket.

142
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,130
靠  饶了我吧
Oh, give me a freakin' break.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,300
你怎么可能知道
How could you possibly know that?

144
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,800
1980年  埃米尔·道贝尔
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,000
得出结论
determined that there was

146
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,230
雪树蟋蟀每分钟的鸣叫次数
a fixed relationship between the number

147
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,030
与环境温度之间
of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket

148
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,500
存在着固定的关系
and the ambient temperature.

149
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,170
而在普通平原蟋蟀之中
A precise relationship that is not present

150
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,170
则不存在这种确切的关系
with ordinary field crickets.

151
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,670
你怎么会知道这房间的确切温度的
How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?

152
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,600
据我与莱纳德室友之间的协定
Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard,

153
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,230
自从06年那次"浸汗之夜"以来
I've had unilateral control of thermostat

154
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,300
就由我来专门负责室内的恒温控制
ever since the sweaty night of '06.

155
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,130
好吧  关于金刚狼的骨爪问题算你说对了
Ok, you were right about wolverine and bone claws,

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,270
但是这次你却错了
but you're wrong about the cricket.

157
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,570
霍华德  少给自己丢脸了
Howard, don't embarrass yourself.

158
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,730
科学就像虫鸣一样从不说谎
The science chirps for itself.

159
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,600
幽默的文字游戏而已
Humorous word play.

160
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,230
不  你绝对错了
No, no, not this time.

161
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,470
我可是昆虫的专家  伙计
I know insects, my friend.

162
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,170
我的整个童年时代
I spent many

163
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,670
基本都在用网捕虫
childhood years capturing them with nets,

164
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,670
把它们放在玻璃瓶里  用针钉成标本
putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them,

165
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,000
用瓦楞纸板做成标签
mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels

166
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,570
为它们分门别类属和种
underneath, identifying the genus and species.

167
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,800
用的可是拉丁文哦
In Latin.

168
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,000
天啊  老兄  你这辈子都别想得到女神垂青了
Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.

169
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,200
绝对是雪树蟋蟀
That is a snowy tree cricket.

170
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,830
雪树蟋蟀[拉丁语]
Oecanthus fultoni.

171
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,130
我早在五年级就通拉丁语了
I was done with Latin by fifth grade.

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
好吧  这么着吧
Okay, okay, tell you what.

173
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,700
这绝对是一只普通平原蟋蟀
I am willing to bet anything

174
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,970
要我赌啥都成
that's an ordinary field cricket.

175
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,030
我不能拿你的钱
I can't take your money.

176
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,730
这算啥  你临阵退缩吗[原词是英语里的鸡]
What's the matter, you chicken?

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,630
我总觉得这个用法很荒谬
I've always found that an inappropriate slur.

178
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,030
鸡这种动物天生就
Chickens are not by nature,

179
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,230
一点儿也不胆小
at all timid.

180
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,730
事实上  在我小时候
In fact, when I was young,

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,130
我邻居家系鸡的绳子松了
my neighbor's chiken got loose

182
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,100
它一直追着我跑到我家门口的大榆树
and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.

183
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,840
鸡不会爬树
Chickens can't climb trees.

184
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,240
谢天谢地
Thank God.

185
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,640
好吧
Okay,

186
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,670
我相信你和鸡有宿怨
I believe a chicken made you his bitch.

187
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,800
但是这件事我可不服
But the cricket thing, I don't buy.

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,970
打赌吧
Bet me.

189
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
好吧
Fair enough.

190
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,740
赌什么
What stakes do you propose?

191
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
就赌我的第四十八期神奇四侠-银影侠现身
I would put my Fantastic Four of No. 48 first appearance of Silver Surfer,

192
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
和你的第123期闪电侠
against your Flash 123,

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,030
两个世界的闪电侠经典系列
the classic Flash of two worlds issue.

194
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,360
好吧  就这么定了
All right, you have a wager.

195
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,800
真是太好了
Hmm. Great.

196
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,300
你们怎么确定输赢呢
Now how are you going to settle it, hmm?

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,930
只有通过实际观察
There is no way to determine the species

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
才能确定蟋蟀的种类吧
of the criet without examining it.

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
我在想今天那个不可怜的人在干嘛
I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,860
-再来点  -好吧
-More wine? -Hit me.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
啥都没有
I don't see anything.

202
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,700
嘘
Shh!

203
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,170
从走廊传来的
Hallway.

204
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,130
一个一个走
One at a time.

205
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
这次又是什么
What was that?

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,030
我的肚子在抗议
My stomach.

207
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,070
吃不惯印度菜
Indian food doesn't agree with me.

208
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,470
这算是讽刺吗
Ironic, isn't it?

209
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,030
嘘
Shh!

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,770
是电梯井
Elevator shaft.

211
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,100
快帮忙打开
Help me open it.

212
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,330
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,630
我们不能下到空的电梯井里去
We can't go down  empty elevator shaft.

214
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,570
好啊  如果你退缩
Fine, if you don't want to proceed,

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,770
就要没收你的赌注
then you forfeit the bet,

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,770
而你的神奇四侠就归我了
and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,130
那就打开她吧
Let's open her up.

218
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,130
这么轻易被我操控  你不烦恼吗
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?

219
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,630
别逼我  谢尔顿
Don't push me, Sheldon.

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,270
我是很矮  但我13岁时可学过功夫
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13,

221
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,800
现在还没生疏呢
and I remember a good deal of it.

222
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,000
是吗
Oh, really?

223
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,730
我有一个哥哥
Well, I grew up with an older brother

224
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,600
还有一对非常好争论的双胞胎姐姐
and a very contentious twin sister.

225
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,330
所以我确信在任何物理对抗中我都占上风
And I believe I could easily best you

226
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,930
并足以揍得你找不到北
in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies

227
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,400
记得那句经典名言吗  "你怎么自己打自己啊"
or the classic "Why are you hitting yourself?"

228
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,730
被鸡追得逃到树上的人还真敢吹啊
Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.

229
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,630
我们现在喝的什么呀
What are we drinking now?

230
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,670
薄荷杜松子酒
Peppermint schnapps.

231
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,800
你买薄荷杜松子酒干嘛呀
Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?

232
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,800
因为我喜欢薄荷
Because I like peppermint,

233
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,830
而且杜松子酒念起来很爽
and it's fun to say schnapps.

234
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,670
-喂  莱纳德  -什么
- Hey, Leonard? - What?

235
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,170
杜松子酒
Schnapps.

236
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,200
杜松子酒
Schnapps.

237
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,270
你对极了  真好玩
You're right, that is fun.

238
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,270
小心啊
Be careful.

239
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,270
假若我不小心
If I were not being careful,

240
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,100
我不会因为你告诉我小心就小心
your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
楼梯里
Stairwell.

242
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,100
哦哦  手电灭了
Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

243
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,600
我需要电池
I need some batteries.

244
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,670
伙计们?
Fellas?

245
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,630
喂?
Hello?

246
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,530
这儿好黑呀
It's really dark down here.

247
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,670
唉  宝贝
Oh, sweetie.

248
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
你真是不会喝酒啊
You really can't hold your liquor, can you?

249
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
我没事
I'm okay.

250
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,730
来点儿漱口水
Just a little mouthwash,

251
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,370
然后你就等着乐个够吧
and then I'm gonna rock your world.

252
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,400
你没事吧
Are you okay?

253
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,230
哎呀  托比  你上辈子造了什么孽
Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life

254
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,130
现在活得这么恶心
to be so disgusting now?

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,400
他不叫托比
His name isn't Toby.

256
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,700
蟋蟀怎么能叫托比呢
Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.

257
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,800
那你会叫他什么
What would you name him?

258
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,460
适合蟋蟀的名字
An appropriate cricket name.

259
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,830
比如说  吉姆尼
For example, Jiminy.

260
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,130
好好
All right,

261
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
谢尔顿  来吧
Sheldon, here we go.

262
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,130
北美昆虫野外指南
Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects.

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,830
嘿  托比
Hey Toby.

264
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,360
就在这儿
Right here.

265
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,400
看见了?
See it?

266
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,430
普通田野蟋蟀
The common field cricket,

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,600
学名Gryllus assimilis
AK Gryllus assimilis,

268
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,130
拉丁文就是"气死你  你输了"的意思
which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."

269
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
等等
Hang on.

270
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,830
看看
Voilà.

271
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,430
雪白树蟋
The snowy tree cricket.

272
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,430
学名Oecanthus fultoni
AKA Oecanthus fultoni,

273
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,660
拉丁文就是"我气不死"
which is Latin for I'll suck nothing.

274
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,930
当然是玩笑
Of course I'm joking

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,660
因为那个的拉丁文是nihil exsorbibo
because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.

276
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,160
这根本不是托比
That is not Toby,

277
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,260
就是托比
this is Toby.

278
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,000
拉杰  你怎么看
Raj, what do you think?

279
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,860
我早已经不关心了
Oh, I really don't care anymore.

280
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,960
天啊  我昨晚上惨透了
God, I had the most horrible night.

281
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,330
显然是与谢萨女神的又一次失败肉体接触
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
是谢夏  谢夏
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

283
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,260
对不起
Forgive me.

284
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,260
德州东部的人都不说犹太语
Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.

285
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,600
即使说  也没说几年
And if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.

286
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,760
好好  随你怎么说
Yeah, fine, whatever.

287
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,800
事实是  你又错了
The point is, you're wrong again.

288
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,260
咱们还没说清上次我什么时候错呢  好了
We haven't established that I'm wrong once. All right.

289
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,500
这么办吧  咱们下楼
Tell you what. Let's go down

290
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,000
去昆虫系
to the Entomology Department

291
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,330
让克莱利教授告诉我们
and let Professor Crawley tell us

292
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,230
托比究竟是哪种蟋蟀
what kind of cricket Toby is.

293
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
他是雪树蟋蟀
He's a snowy tree cricket,

294
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
而且他叫吉姆尼
and his name is Jiminy.

295
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,160
我打赌要是在这屋里扔块石头
I bet I could throw a rock in this room

296
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,730
也能打中三个更好的朋友
and come up with three better friends.

297
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,530
我的天啊
Holy crap.

298
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,630
这块儿简直就像《沉默的羔羊》
It's like Silence of the Lambs down here.

299
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,400
不要那样
Don't do that.

300
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,400
你简直像个女生
You're such a girl.

301
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,500
不过是虫子
The're just bugs.

302
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,930
哼  我不喜欢虫子  怎么啦
Yeah, well, I don't like bugs, okay?

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,060
它们让我害怕
They freak me out.

304
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,430
有趣
Interesting

305
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,800
你既怕虫子又怕女人
You're afraid of insects and women.

306
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,330
瓢虫[英文: 女士+虫]还不得把你吓昏了
Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

307
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,760
这是笑话
It was a joke.

308
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,430
我编来让你放松的
I made it to lessen your discomfort.

309
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,000
不用客气
You're welcome.

310
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,600
别敲门
Don't knock.

311
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,860
尽管进来吧
Just walk in.

312
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,560
对一位世界领先地位的
Why be polite to the world's leading expert

313
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
屎克螂专家客气什么啊
on the dung beetle?

314
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,260
对不起
Excuse me,

315
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,000
你是克莱利教授吗
are you Professor Crawley?

316
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,100
谁想知道
Who wants to know?

317
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
我是物理系的库珀博士
I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.

318
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,260
等不及了  是不?
Couldn't wait, huh?

319
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,330
什么
I'm sorry?

320
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
我还没装完东西
I haven't even packed yet,

321
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,860
你就已经来量我的实验室了
and you're already measuring my lab

322
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,160
准备装你们那些无神论的激光机器
for one of your godless laser machines.

323
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,230
不是  你不明白
No, you don't understand.

324
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,830
我们只想问你个问题
We just want to ask you a question.

325
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,830
让我先问你
Let me ask you one first.

326
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
一位世界知名的昆虫学家
What's a world renowned entomologist

327
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,530
有博士学位
with a doctorate

328
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,100
有二十年的经验  当学校裁掉
and 20 years of experience to do with his life

329
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
他实验室的经费之后他该干什么
when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?

330
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
向别人吐嘈
Ask rhetorical questions

331
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
让人家不舒服
that make people uncomfortable?

332
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,000
你又是怎么回事
What's your deal?

333
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,700
他们是不是打算把我的职位外包到班加罗尔
Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?

334
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,730
我是新德里来的
I'm from New Delhi.

335
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,730
也许你该去问别的昆虫学家
Maybe you should find another entomologist.

336
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
不行不行  咱们来了就得弄清楚
No, no. We're here. Let's settle this.

337
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,330
教授  你能辨认出我们的蟋蟀吗
Professor, can you identify our cricket?

338
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
我当然能
Of course I can.

339
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,430
我能认出全世界所有的昆虫和节肢动物
I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet.

340
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
但我也一样得去
Not that that's going

341
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,230
投奔我住在奥克斯纳德的女儿
to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard.

342
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,730
而且这不是
And we're not talking

343
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,260
海滩旁边的奥克斯纳德
Oxnard at the beach. No!

344
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,530
我们说的是葱地中间的
We're talking Oxnard

345
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
奥克斯纳德
in the onion fields.

346
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,800
能帮忙鉴定下托比
Well, could you look at Toby?

347
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,300
托比
Toby?

348
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,360
蟋蟀叫这名字真蠢
What a stupid name for a cricket.

349
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,360
我就说嘛
Told ya.

350
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,060
就是只普通黑蟋蟀
It's a field cricket.

351
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,300
-太好了  -不  等等
- Yes! - No, no, wait.

352
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
克莱利教授  你确定吗
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

353
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,030
年轻人  我从8岁起就开始学习昆虫知识
Young man,I've been studying insects since I was eight years old.

354
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,930
知道上学时他们都叫我什么
You know what they used to call me in school?

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,960
爬虫克莱利
Creepy Crawley.

356
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,860
这么叫你或许很残忍
Cruel as that may be,

357
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,960
但并不能证明什么
But this is not in itself a credential.

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,260
给你们看点东西
Let me show you something.

359
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,930
看到没
See that?

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
这是以我克莱利命名的金龟子
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

361
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,730
我在婆罗洲的热带雨林里长途跋涉了六个月
I discovered it after spending six months slogging

362
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
才发现了它
Through a Bornean rain forest,

363
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,960
而我妻子却在家跟个穷酸的鸟类学家同居了
While my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist

364
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,730
那人住在艘帆船上  还喜欢穿牛仔喇叭裤
Who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans!

365
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,330
所以  我跟你说这就是只普通黑蟋蟀时
So, when I tell you that it's a common field cricket,

366
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,900
就是确凿无疑的[双关  bank当银行解]
You can take that to the damn bank!

367
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,700
上帝知道  我都不用跑银行了
'Cause God knows I can't!

368
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,500
那荡妇把我洗劫一空
That tramp took me for everything!

369
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,630
很显然  我错了
Well, apparently, I was wrong.

370
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
恭喜
Congratulations.

371
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
祝你在奥克斯纳德过得愉快
Enjoy Oxnard.

372
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,160
相信你女儿一直盼着你去
I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.

373
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,070
谢尔顿
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

374
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
拿的什么  新漫画书
What you got there? New comic book?

375
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,030
旧漫画书
Old comic book.

376
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,030
刚从银行保管箱里取出来的
I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.

377
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,070
你要银行保管箱干嘛
What do you have a safe deposit box for?

378
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,070
存旧漫画书
Old comic books.

379
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,230
用一场考虑不充分的蟋蟀赌局后  我把这输给了沃罗威茨
I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.

380
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,930
什么  他们在玩蟋蟀电玩吗
What, do they have Wii cricket now?

381
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,430
这可不常见
That can't be very popular.

382
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,630
佩妮  我不想谈这些
Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.

383
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,300
看这能不能让你好受些
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

384
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,800
我也不觉得自己有多性感了
I'm not feeling so hot either.

385
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,430
为什么这会让我好受些
Why would that make me feel better?

386
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
我不知道  有共鸣
I don't know, empathy?

387
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,100
总之  我的意思是
Anyway, I'm just saying,

388
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,100
你因霍华德而觉得沮丧
That you're feeling upset about something with Howard,

389
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,930
-我也因莱纳德而心情不好  -对
- And I'm upset about something with Leonard. - Yes

390
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,130
不尽如人意的性爱
Yes, the disappointing sex.

391
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
这怎么能相提并论
That's an inexact parallel.

392
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,030
你和莱纳德总可以当回朋友
You and Leonard can always return to being friends,

393
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,570
我却再也不可能回到过去
Whereas I can never return to a state

394
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,020
回到被沃罗威茨像莱利太太家的鸡那样
In which Wolowitz has not bested me

395
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,400
狠狠地把我击败之前
Like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

396
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,530
什么莱利太太家的鸡
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

397
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
就是莱利太太家养的鸡嘛
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.

398
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,500
好吧  忘了那些鸡吧
Okay, forget the chicken.

399
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,900
我倒也想
Well, I wish I could.

400
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,500
不  不
No, no.

401
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,330
关于我跟莱纳德你倒可能说对了
You may be right about me and Leonard.

402
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,670
我当然是对的
Of course I'm right.

403
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,500
我一周出错两次的几率能是多少
What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?

404
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,870
不  我是说  我们总可以做回朋友的
No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.

405
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,970
这话我刚说过了
I just said that.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,500
这对话又回到了原点  休会
This conversation has started to circle.Meeting adjourned.

407
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,970
你怎么了
What's going on?

408
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,070
你是想知道我今天的所有行程  好吧
Oh,you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right

409
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,600
我在银行等了半个小时
Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank

410
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,200
取了保管箱里的东西
To get into my safe deposit box,

411
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,900
然后被迫跟佩妮聊了你们的性生活问题
I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems,

412
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,370
对了  还有
And, oh, yes,

413
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,370
在一个充满了醍醐灌顶的时刻
In a moment filled with biblical resonance,

414
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,430
所谓骄者必败
Pride wentth before my fall,

415
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,230
我把第123期闪电侠输给了沃罗威茨
Causing my Flash 123 to go with to Wolowitz.

416
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,470
等等
Wait a minute.

417
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,030
你跟佩妮谈起我们俩的性生活
You talked to Penny about our sex life?

418
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,870
莱纳德  你不断地关注这些无关紧要的  真让我吃惊
Leonard,it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial.

419
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,670
我说我打赌输给沃罗威茨了
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

420
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,000
对的
Right, right.

421
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,600
你是说你跟佩妮谈话了
You're saying you talked to Penny?

422
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,930
是的
Ye-Yes.

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,670
很有趣
Interesting.

424
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
怎么可能
Hardly.

425
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,630
失陪
Excuse me.

426
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,100
我又过分了吗
Have I crossed some sort of line again?

427
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,130
有点
Little bit.

428
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
谁在乎
Oh, who cares?

429
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,160
谢尔顿跟你说什么了
Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?

430
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,200
没说很多
Not a lot.

431
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,600
就说我们俩总可以回头做朋友的
Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.

432
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,760
你想这样吗
Is that what you want?

433
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,060
我不知道
I don't know.

434
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,730
但你不得不承认
I mean, you have to admit

435
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,460
我们只做朋友那会  一切都简单多了
Things seemed simpler when we were just friends.

436
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,330
可能吧
I guess.

437
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,960
那会减轻很多压力
It would take the pressure off.

438
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,260
确实会  不是吗
It would, wouldn't it?

439
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,460
所以  我们就做朋友吧
So, we'll just be friends.

440
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,630
很好
Good.

441
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
很好
Good.

442
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,060
过来
Come here.

443
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,430
一切都好
Okay-dokay.
