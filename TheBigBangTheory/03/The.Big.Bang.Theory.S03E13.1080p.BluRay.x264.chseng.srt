1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,710
我们好像好久
Seems like forever

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,190
没有四个人一起出来吃饭了  我是说
Since the four of us have been out to eat   you know?

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,240
没有女生的情况下
Just the guys.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,020
够了吧  我们知道了
Oh   god! Yes   we get it.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,530
你现在有女朋友了
You have a girlfriend now.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,470
搞得你小嫉妒了吗  真不好意思
A little jealous   sorry?

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,290
谁嫉妒了
No   I'm not jealous.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,300
好吧  为了能嘿咻我愿意付出一切代价
All right   I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,100
可以点菜了吗
Now   can we order?

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,870
天啊  他们更新了菜单
Oh   dear lord   they re-did the menu.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,490
那又怎样  菜又没变
So what? It's the same food.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,190
是吗  看看这个
Oh   is it? Look at this.

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,270
左宗棠鸡[被归为湘菜]
General tso's chicken

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,230
它不是在招牌菜之列了
Is no longer listed under "Specialties."

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,770
而是归在鸡料理下面了
It's now under "Chicken."

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,850
所以呢[So与'Tso'同音]
So?

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,390
是的  是左宗棠鸡
Yes   general tso.

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,530
我不是说"左"  我是问"所以呢"
Not "Tso  " The chicken   "So" The question.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,610
所以呢
So?

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,260
所以  它为什么不是招牌菜了呢
So   why is it no longer a specialty?

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,060
这里的厨师是对这道菜没了信心
Did the chef lose confidence

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,770
还是对他自己没了信心啊
In the dish or himself?

23
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,010
再看这里
And look over here.

24
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,970
强盗酱沾鲜虾
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,780
强盗酱是什么
What is "Mobster sauce"?

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,400
这明显是打印错误
It's obviously a typo.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,250
也许吧  也可能是这家餐馆现在是
Perhaps. Or perhaps this restaurant's

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,330
一场有组织的犯罪活动的前线阵地
Now a front for organized crime.

29
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,560
就上面的介绍来看  强盗酱里包含
For all we know   the mobster sauce

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,310
丰富的已死强盗的肉
Contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.

31
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,610
不不不不  我觉得它的意思是
No   no   no   no-- I think it just means

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,710
这是一种强盗们喜欢的酱料
It's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,090
没那么复杂啦
It doesn't mean any of that!

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,210
只是打印错误而已
It's a typo.

35
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,490
这样吧  我们还是去吃批萨
You know what? Let's just get a pizza.

36
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,250
好主意  我们去柯里昂意式餐厅
Good idea. We'll go to corleone's.

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,910
当然好  那儿可没有强盗
Sure   no mobsters there.

38
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,020
知道不  我越想越觉得
You know   the more I think about it

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,480
强盗酱里不可能包含
the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,940
丰富的强盗肉
chunks of mobster.

41
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,250
这又是为什么呢
And why is that?

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,020
它被归在海鲜里
It was listed under "Seafood."

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,220
如果他们是一群跟鱼睡觉的强盗呢
What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?

44
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,650
莱纳德  这可是很严肃的话题
Leonard   are we having a serious conversation or not?

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,060
天啊...
What the...?

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
电视机不见了
The tv is gone.

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,900
我们的笔记本也没了
So are our laptops.

48
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,920
老天
Oh   god.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,020
老天
Oh   god.

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,180
老天爷啊!
Oh   god!

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,070
还好还好
It's all right.

52
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,100
我的漫画书都还在
They didn't take my comic books.

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,700

我们喜欢玩游戏
We like games.

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,000
对了  游戏  他们拿走了光晕1

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,030
犯罪现场鉴证科什么时候到
When does the csi team get here?

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,060
什么
What?

75
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,790
鉴于他们要过来
In anticipation of their arrival

76
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,320
我已经包好了一些证据
I've bagged some evidence.

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,550
其中一个贼匪在扫荡我们的屋子时
One of the thieves had the audacity

78
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,040
居然斗胆解决了自己的摄水问题
To quench his thirst while ransacking our home.

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,990
你们应该可以从上面找到一些有效的指纹
You should be able to pull some good prints off this.

80
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,410
这些是我的指纹
And now   here are my prints

81
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,410
这样你们就可以把我排除在嫌疑之外了
So you can rule me out as a suspect.

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,780
那我呢
What about me?

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,590
对不起  莱纳德  现在就排除
I'm sorry   leonard. It's too early to discount

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,970
内鬼作案的可能性还为时过早
The possibility of this being an inside job.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,160
我请求你枪毙了他也不算太过分吧
Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?

86
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,080
我很乐意把他送进监护病房
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,970
进行72小时的精神病观察
Psychiatric hold.

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,100
我不是疯子
I'm not crazy.

89
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,920
我妈妈带我去做过测试了
My mother had me tested.

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,470
我都问完了
We're done here.

91
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,880
打这个电话  我们会把调查报告传真给你们的
Call this number   and we'll fax you a copy of the report

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,990
这样你们就能向保险公司索赔了
So you can submit it to your insurance company.

93
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,130
请稍等
I-I'm sorry.

94
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,220
你这就算问完了吗
That's the end of your inquiry?

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,760
那你还有什么相关的信息要提供吗
Do you have any more information that might be relevant?

96
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,830
天呐  多得去了  比如说
Oh   my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance--

97
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,160
我笔记本电脑里
My laptop contained

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,940
有五种思维实验  其中四种
four out of the five gedankenexperiments

99
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,610
都是关于量子测量课题的
necessary for a cogent restatement

100
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,360
强有力的重述
of the quantum measurement problem.

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,930
这对他们有何帮助
How is that going to help them?

102
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,180
这样他们就可以监控科学出版社
They could monitor scientific publications and see

103
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,550
看看有没有其他人在未来的几个月内
if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next

104
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,050
寄给他们这类重述  如果有
Couple of months. If so

105
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,990
该作者就很有可能
The authors are most likely

106
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,900
偷了我的笔记本电脑
in possession of my stolen laptop.

107
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,330
晚安  孩子们
Good night   fellas.

108
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,880
收工  波齐科
Come on   Bochco.

109
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,100
我们现在该怎么办
What are we supposed to do now?

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
唯一能做的就是
The only thing we can do.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,040
在罪犯回来前坐下看看手机电视
Watch tv on our phones until the criminals return

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,960
在熟睡后被他棒打致死
and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.

113
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,310
这是否意味着我排除嫌疑了
Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?

114
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,090
我多么希望不是你
Oh   how I wish I could.

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,720
我不必去尿尿
I do not have to urinate.

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,470
我的膀胱我做主
I am the master of my own bladder.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,700
该死
Drat.

118
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
太难以置信了
I can't believe it.

119
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,720
要不是我一直在餐厅上班
If I hadn't been working the dinner shift

120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,840
我可就和盗贼正面相遇了
I would've run right into the robbers.

121
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,280
你不必感到害怕
Hey   there's no reason for you to be scared.

122
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,350
我才不怕
I'm not scared.

123
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,010
我会给他们的屁屁还以重击
I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.

124
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,000
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,260
莱纳德  佩妮

126
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,330
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

127
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,780
把球棒给我
Hand me the bat.

128
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,530
本栋楼刚发生恶性罪案
We just had a major crime in the building

129
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,970
你问都没问就开门了
And you open the door without asking who it is?

130
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,290
不会再发生了  你啥事
It won't happen again. What's up?

131
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,010
没事
Nothing.

132
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,250
来看看你俩是否安好
I just wanted to see if you were both okay.

133
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,740
我们好得很  谢尔顿
We're fine   Sheldon.

134
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,440
那好吧
All right   then.

135
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night.  - Good night.

136
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,980
即使是谢尔顿  刚才也显得真怪
That was weird   even for him.

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,330
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

138
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,760
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

139
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,170
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

140
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,590
请问哪位
Who is it?

141
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,750
谢尔顿  谢尔顿·库珀
Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.

142
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,110
你好
Yes?

143
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,640
我可以进来吗
May I come in?

144
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,810
来吧
Yeah.

145
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,180
貌似你们在喝酒
I see you're drinking wine.

146
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,060
不错
Yes   we are.

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,910
然后准备就寝了
And we're about to go to bed.

148
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
谢尔顿  你是不是要在这儿过夜
Sheldon   do you want to sleep here tonight?

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,930
尽管莱纳德身型娇小
Oh   as small as Leonard is

150
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,540
我还是觉得你俩在沙发上睡不太舒服
I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.

151
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,110
你要怎样
What do you want?

152
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,790
不是我的问题  而是进化规律
It's not what I want   it's what evolution wants.

153
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,010
人类是灵长类动物
Human beings are primates.

154
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,820
灵长类动物一般是群居生活
Primates have evolved to live in groups

155
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,720
从而互相保护  互相关爱
both for protection and support.

156
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,960
但你不喜欢群居
But you don't like other people.

157
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,270
今晚不同
I do tonight.

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,820
那儿太恐怖了
It's scary over there.

159
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,040
这儿也快了
It's getting scary here   too.

160
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,190

三头小猪
Three little pigs?

162
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,580
上帝啊  我不知道
God   I don't know.

163
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,130
星球大战
Star Wars?

164
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,810
我们赢了吗  能上床了吗
Did we win? Can we go to bed?

165
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,130
天呐  已经简单到极至了
Good lord-- I could not have made this easier.

166
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,630

171
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,530
梨加挠痒痒[par+tickle]
Pear-tickle.

172
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,100
希格斯粒子  玻色子  微量子
Higgs boson particle.

173
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,920
你怎么就想不通
How could you not get that?

174
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,790
没错  佩妮  都画那儿了
He's right   penny. It's all there.

175
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,330
谢尔顿  亲爱的  我知道你有不安全感
Sheldon   sweetie   I know you're feeling insecure

176
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,490
但我们真得睡觉了
But we've really got to go to sleep.

177
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,110
那好吧  我先值第一班
All right. I'll take the first watch

178
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,650
世界时4点再叫醒你们
And wake you at 0400.

179
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,030
太好了  晚安
Great. Good night.

180
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,640
等等  什么叫世界时4点
Wait   wait-- what's 0400?

181
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,190
-就是四点  -那不还差45分钟就到了吗
- 4:00 a.M. - That's   like   in 45 minutes.

182
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,700
赶紧撤
Just keep walking.

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,550
那里静悄悄的
it's quiet out there.

184
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,300
可能太安静了
Maybe a little too quiet.

185
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,590
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

186
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,520
就出去看看
Just gonna take a look around outside.

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,280
糟糕的主意
Bad idea.

188
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,010
不  吉姆  别开门
No   jim   don't open the door!

189
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,190
听她的没错  吉姆

199
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,290
万一他们切断电源呢

200
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,850
内置200瓦不间断的

What if someone kidnaps me   forces me to record my voice

205
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,910
还被绑匪割下了拇指呢
and then cuts off my thumb?

206
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,680
那我可要送一篮子松饼感谢他们
I'll send them a basket of muffins.

207
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,260
而在屋内  配备了动作监测器
Now   inside   we've got motion detectors

208

running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.

210
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,260
你从哪儿搞来这些玩意
Where did you get all this stuff?

211
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,230
我在国防部有个朋友
Eh   I got a buddy over at the Department of Defense.

212
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,920
他这么大方给你了吗
He just gave it to you?

213
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,270
我要是开口  他肯定会给的
I'm sure he would have if I had asked.

214
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,870
讽刺的是  他们的保安系统
Ironically   their security

215
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,540
也不是这么完善嘛
isn't all that good.

真是"完美"的保安系统
Wonderful security system

221
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,100
遭受金枪鱼群袭击时用正好
If we're attacked by a school of tuna.

222
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,820
别担心  这渔网还将通电
Don't worry   the net's going to be electrified.

223
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,690
她一旦倒在地上  全身便会不可自主地痉挛
You picture her on the floor   spasming uncontrollably.

224
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,630
这还差不多
Better.

225
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,130
谢尔顿的日记[恶搞《守望者》中的罗夏日记]

保安系统已安装到位
Security system in place.

227
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,050
但我依然难以入睡
However   sleep continues to elude me.

228
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,980
我目睹了帕萨迪纳市的阴暗面[加州城市]
I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena...

229
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,410
这座所谓的玫瑰之城  如今阴魂不散
This so-called city of roses   and it haunts me.

230
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,710
罪恶横行  毫无正义
Ah   the injustice.

231
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,100
我被痛苦折磨  辗转反侧
I lie here awake   tormented

232
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,930
而邪恶四处潜伏在外
while out there evil lurks

233
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,320
可能正霸占我的经典任天堂玩大金刚呢
probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.

234
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,740
老天
Oh   dear.

235
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,150
我的膀胱我做主
I am the master of my own bladder.

236
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,930
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

237
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,010
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

238
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,490
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

239
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,830
天哪
Oh   my...

240
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,970
老天  谢尔顿
God   Sheldon.

241
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,240
见鬼的你到底在外面干什么
What the hell are you doing out there?

242
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,550
我听到有响声
I heard a noise.

243
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,240
那是我们
It was us.

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
撞翻了一个台灯
We knocked over a lamp.

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,670
你们干嘛要撞翻台灯
Why would you knock over a lamp?

246
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,010
-我们正要...  -没必要告诉他
- We were going to have...  - He doesn't need

247
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,520
我们在干嘛  莱纳德
to know what we were doing   Leonard.

248
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,520
没错  我是没必要知道你们在干嘛
No   she's right   I don't need to know what you were doing.

249
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
继续吧
Carry on.

250
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,870
你干什么
What are you doing?

251
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,670
走门就可以了
Use the door.

252
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,030
好主意
Good thinking.

253
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,780
或许我该四处查看下
Perhaps I'll check the perimeter

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,540
再泡点热牛奶
and make some warm milk.

255
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,750
很好  去吧
Great   you do that.

256
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,980
你想要我给你带点热牛奶吗
Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?

257
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,840
我有乳糖不耐症
I'm lactose intolerant.

258
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,280
你是不想再弄出更大的声响来吓我
And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises.

259
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,800
想得真周到
Very thoughtful.

260
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,200
佩妮  要热牛奶吗
Warm milk   Penny?

261
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,950
不了  谢谢
No   thanks.

262
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,380
好吧
Fine.

263
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,800
晚安  先生
Good night to you   sir.

264
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
还有女士
Miss.

265
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,240
真是抱歉
Sorry about that.

266
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,150
你又无能为力
Ugh   what can you do?

267
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,250
过来
Here.

268
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,810
防盗警报  防盗警报
Intruder alert   intruder alert.

269
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,300
防盗警报  防盗警报
Intruder alert   intruder alert.

270
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,790
看来沃罗威茨启动电网了
Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.

271
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,390
谢尔顿你没事吧
Sheldon   are you okay?

272
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,490
我  我没事
I-I'm fine...

273
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,210
只是控制不了自己的膀胱了
Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.

274
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,290
我的新电脑装了瘟骑系统
My new computer came with windows 7.

275
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,310
瘟骑比围死他更容易上手嘛
Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than windows vista.

276
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,110
这我可不喜欢
I don't like that.

277
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,710
你不觉得搬到新城市去
Don't you think looking for a new city to live in

278
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,070
有点反应过激了吗
is a bit of an overreaction?

279
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,930
我们的公寓被盗
Our apartment was broken into

280
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,170
我们的保安系统又差点杀了我
Our security system tried to kill me

281
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,740
因此  我决定永久搬离帕萨迪纳
And as a result   I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

282
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,890
你说我这能叫反应过度吗
Tell me how that's overreacting.

283
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,670
拜托  谢尔顿  你可不能搬
Come on   Sheldon   you can't move.

284
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,080
你不是该留在原地吗
Don't you need to stay in one place

285
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,340
这样你的母舰返回时候
so the mother ship can find you

286
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,840
才能找到你
when it returns?

287
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,850
真是这样就好了
Oh   if that were only true.

288
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,360
不幸的是  在可预见的将来  我还得呆地球上
Unfortunately   as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future

289
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,910
一定得找个比帕萨迪纳
I need to find a location that's more hospitable

290
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,310
更加友好安全的地方  比如
than the mean streets of Pasadena   like...

291
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,590
俄克拉荷马州的伊尼德市
Enid   Oklahoma.

292
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,900
低犯罪率
Low crime rate

293
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,350
加上高速网络
and high-speed internet connectivity...

294
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,110
但没有火车模型店
But no model train shops.

295
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,040
抱歉  伊尼德市
Sorry   Enid.

296
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,160
他要辞了大学的工作吗
Is he quitting his job at the university?

297
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,300
不  他准备远程办公
Oh   no   he's going to telecommute.

298
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,400
大家都乐见于此
Everybody's really excited about it.

299
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,080
好了
All right.

300
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,420
北卡罗来纳州  布恩市
Boone   North Carolina.

301
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
自1952年以前的每年夏天
"Every summer since 1952

302
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,540
布恩市都会在露天的原型剧场重演
Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal

303
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,340
与之同名的丹尼尔·布恩时代的生活图景
Of the life and times of its namesake   Dan'l Boone."

304
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,860
感觉这会吸引一帮不良分子过去
Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd.

305
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,550
佩妮  你来自内布拉斯加  对吗
Penny   you're from Nebraska   correct?

306
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,300
土生土长
Born and raised.

307
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,500
我要过几天才能安顿好
It will take me a few days to get settled.

308
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,680
到时候我会发详细的文档给你
After I do   I will e-mail you detailed PDFs

309
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,720
包括图解和操作指南
containing diagrams and instructions

310
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,540
指导你打包和装运
that will guide you through packing and shipping

311
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,470
我余下的行李到蒙大拿州的波兹曼市
the rest of my possessions to Bozeman   Montana.

312
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,530
同时  别忘了转发我的邮件
In the meantime   please forward my mail.

313
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,350
具体需要发给谁
Any place specific

314
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,200
还是只需发给蒙大拿州波兹曼市的疯人院
Or just the Bozeman   Montana loony bin?

315
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,370
我知道你在开玩笑
I sense you're making a joke

316
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,340
但波兹曼市确实有家喜剧俱乐部叫疯人院
But Bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin

317
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,280
别转发到那去
so do not forward my mail there.

318
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,370
拜托
Oh   come on.

319
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,140
你不幸成了盗窃案失主
So you were the victim of a crime.

320
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,780
这本就是生活的一部分
That's part of life.

321
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,180
我曾祖父第一次来美国时
When my great-grandfather first came to this country

322
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,970
把全部希望与梦想都寄托于
he put all his hopes and dreams

323
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,540
他开在纽约下东区的
Into this little butcher shop he ran

324
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,390
那家小小的肉铺里
on the lower east side of New York.

325
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,780
你猜怎么着
You know what happened?

326
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,510
凡是去光顾他肉铺
Every customer who walked into that butcher shop

327
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,460
去买猪肝的人
and asked for a pound of liver

328
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,650
他都宰客没商量
got ripped off.

329
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,220
但是
But...

330
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,320
那些人看开了走出来了  你也该这样
Those people moved on   and so should you.

331
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,300
我是走出来了啊
I am moving on.

332
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,320
我要搬去波兹曼市
I'm going to be a Bozite.

333
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,620
（Bozite是德克萨斯州一个荒废的"鬼镇"）
他们会自称"波兹曼人"吗
They call themselves "Bozites"?

334
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,730
就该这么叫  这是我到那之后
They should. It's one of the first things

335
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,680
计划的首要任务之一
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

336
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,290
谢尔顿  我不敢相信我会这么说
Sheldon   I can't believe I'm saying this

337
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,230
但我会想你的
But I'm going to miss you.

338
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,550
佩妮  要知道我不喜欢
Penny   as you know   I'm not comfortable

339
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,120
漫长的道别和离情别绪
with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion

340
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,380
所以我准备了一个短片
so I prepared a short video.

341
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,830
大家好
Greetings.

342
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,670
要知道我不喜欢漫长的道别
As you know   I'm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes

343
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,690
和离情别绪
and maudlin displays of emotion

344
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,950
所以我准备了这个短片
so I prepared this short video.

345
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,160
你们四位  有三位是我的好友
The four of you are three of my closest friends

346
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,620
还有一位也是难得的点头之交
and one treasured acquaintance.

347
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,750
虽然我无法断言  没有了你们
Though I cannot state categorically that my life

348
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,470
我的人生将从此失色不少
will be diminished by not having you in it

349
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,440
但你们要这么想的话  我也没意见
I am comfortable if you choose to believe that.

350
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,500
既然你们打算继续留在
Since you intend to remain

351
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,420
这座罪案猖獗的大都市
in this lawless metropolitan area

352
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,030
根据统计数据  在我们再见之前
statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic

353
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,460
你们就会死于非命  遭遇不测
and gruesome ends before we meet again.

354
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,350
生生不息  繁荣昌盛[瓦肯人的经典手势]
Live long and prosper.

355
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,080
谢尔顿  这实在是...
Sheldon   that's so...

356
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,430
我走后你们该及时锁门
You might want to lock the door behind me.

357
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,660
这里可不是波兹曼
This isn't Bozeman.

358
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,180
我怎么知道谁是好友
How the hell do I know who's the friend

359
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,280
谁又是泛泛之交
and who's the acquaintance?

360
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,930
冷得人心旷神怡
That is a bracing cold

361
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,860
冷得人精神一振
An invigorating cold.

362
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,660
天哪  好冷啊
Lord   is it cold!

363
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,520
先生  我帮你拿包吧
Help you with your bags   sir?

364
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,530
谢谢  波兹曼朋友
Thank you   fellow Bozite.

365
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,350
你真是我们这美丽小镇的商会
And may I say   you are the living embodiment of all

366
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,800
所许承诺的最好体现
the promises made by our lovely town's chamber of commerce.

367
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,360
等等我
Wait!

368
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,830
等等
Wait!

369
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,190
快给我回来
Excuse me!

370
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,990
给我一张去加州帕萨迪纳市的票
One ticket to Pasadena   California   please.

371
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,650
看看谁回来了
Hey   look who's back!

372
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,620
真有趣
Interesting.

373
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,250
居然是泛泛之交第一个欢迎我
The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
