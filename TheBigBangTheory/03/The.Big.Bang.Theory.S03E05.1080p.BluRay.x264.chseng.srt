1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,060
好的  拉杰出了幽灵军团卡
All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card,

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,900
我就出绞杀蔓藤帮他
And I am going to back him up with my strangling vines.

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,440
绞死你  笨蛋
Choke on that, sucka.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,340
那我就用红宝石剑砍断你的蔓藤
Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,280
没错  我干的  我砍了
That's right, I did it. I cut 'em.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,100
我想问个问题
I have a question.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,850
军团能吃巨人  巨人能吃精灵
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,190
精灵能吃水妖
Elf beats water sprite,

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,730
基本上什么都能吃魔法小兔
And basically everything beats enchanted bunny.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,760
除非你有胡萝卜粉
Unless you have the carrot powder.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,900
我还想问一个问题
Okay, I've got another question.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,920
这有什么好玩的
When does this get fun?

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,870
我们是要讨论
Are we going to talk

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,820
还是继续玩"卡亚神秘勇士"
Or are we going to play "mystic warriors of ka-ah"?

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,120
出毒药卡
Just play a potion card.

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,590
哪张
Which one?

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,630
哪张都一样
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,810
你不可能赢了
You can't possibly win.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,960
谢尔顿  别破坏游戏
Sheldon, don't ruin the game.

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,410
他怎么可能破坏游戏
How could he ruin the game?

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,170
根据已出的卡推算
Given the cards that have already been played,

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,760
佩妮手上只能有巫师毒药
Penny can only be holding necromancer potions,

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,090
毒药只对幽灵和日行者有效
Which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers,

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,820
但两个都已经出完了
And there are no more of either left to be drawn.

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,260
剩下未出的卡是
The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are:

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,610
四张火焰  一张巨人  两张食人怪和冥神宝石
Four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of osiris.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,930
瞧  被破坏了吧
See? Ruined.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,770
谢尔顿  太厉害了
Sheldon, that is incredible.

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,950
对你来说  当然是厉害
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,160
谢尔顿有图像式记忆的能力
Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,280
"图像式"用词不当
"photographic" is a misnomer.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,160
应该是高清图像式记忆  我说过好几遍了
I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times.

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,360
最近一次是去年5月7日
Most recently last year during lunch

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,150
中午午餐期间
On the afternoon of may seventh.

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,790
你吃了火鸡  还抱怨太干了
You had turkey and complained it was dry.

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,620
看来游戏结束了
Well, I guess game'over.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,590
真的  太好了
Really? Oh, great.

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,090
我是说"哦"
I mean, aw.

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,010
-我得走了  -为什么
- Okay, I gotta go. - Why?

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,550
就因为上次没走
Because the last me I didn't go,

41
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,380
我才会玩"卡神秘勇士"
I ended up playing "mystic warlords of ka."

42
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,150
不是"卡"  是"卡亚"
Not "ka. Ka-ah."

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,360
拜丫儿
Buh-eye.

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
回见
See ya.

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,190
还是不敢相信她和我在一起了
Still can't believe she's going out with me.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,950
没人相信
Nobody can.

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,820
这倒提醒我有笔旧账还没跟你算清
That reminds me I have a bone to pick with you.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,570
什么
What?

49
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,520
你我有个约定
You and I made a pact

50
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,990
我们中谁先追到个漂亮女友
That if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend,

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,490
谁就得让他的女友
That person would have his girlfriend

52
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,710
给对方介绍一个女友
Hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.

53
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,750
我不记得有这回事
I don't remember that.

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,150
2004年  6月30日
June 30th, 2004.

55
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,700
《蜘蛛侠 2》在帕萨迪纳AMC影院上映
Opening day of Spider-Man 2 at the Amc Pasadena.

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,410
那里只有红冰极饮料  没有蓝的
They only had red icees, no blue.

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,840
想起来了
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,480
你和佩妮在一起都有一个半月了
So you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now.

59
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,990
我的妞呢
Where's my shorty, morty?

60
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,510
霍华德  你不能要求我这么做
Howard, you can't hold me to that.

61
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,730
为什么不行
Why not?

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,100
因为当时约定时
Because when I made that agreement,

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,900
我没想过能交到一个漂亮女友
I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend.

64
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,320
我当时以为你能交到呢
And I was positive you ever would.

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,240
我怎么不知道这件事
Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?

66
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,020
你当时不在小食店
You had left the refreshment stand

67
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,530
你去解决习惯性提前出现的尿急了
In order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.

68
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,410
就因为这个
Oh, so that's how it works?

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,900
就因为我的膀胱小  我就不能有漂亮女友了
I have a teeny bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,040
对  拉杰  就因为这个
Yeah, Raj. That's how it works.

71
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,590
靠
Damn.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
生活大爆炸第三季第五集

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,000
能给我张纸巾吗
Can I have a napkin?

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,720
抱歉  不行
I'm sorry, no.

75
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,220
你有好几张呢
But you have whole bunch of 'em.

76
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,760
对  我现在用的是四张纸巾体系
Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system.

77
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,430
分别对应腿  手  脸和个人紧急情况
Lap, hands, face and personal emergency.

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,630
你需要的话  明天开始
If you like, starting tomorrow,

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,270
我会加一张客用纸巾
I'll add a guest napkin,

80
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,260
但我今天实在无能为力
But I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.

81
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,930
好运  那是擦脸纸巾
Good luck. That's the face napkin.

82
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,880
你跟佩妮说了吗
So, have you talked to Penny yet?

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,030
还没有
No, I haven't.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,170
为什么
Why not?

85
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,550
因为我很忙
Because I've been busy,

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,370
因为我不知道怎么跟她提
Because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up,

87
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,350
最主要的是  "特别强调这点"
And mostly-- and I can't stress how key this is--

88
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,190
因为我不想提
Because I don't want to.

89
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,510
莱纳德  约定就是约定
Leonard, pact is a pact.

90
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,550
你必须让佩妮给我找个伴
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,550
事情没那么简单
It's not that simple.

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
你要我怎么说
What am I supposed to say?

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,930
佩妮  你有没有
"Penny, do you have any friend

94
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,380
不想再联系的朋友
You'd like to never hear from again?"

95
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
拜托  我那么聪明
Come on, I'm smart,

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,090
又有份好工作  而且我的体脂肪率只有3%
I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.

97
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,310
真的
It's true.

98
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,890
我在沙滩上看过
I've seen him at the beach.

99
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,110
他就像个人形鸡翅
He's like a human chicken wing.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,730
莱纳德  拜托
Leonard, come on.

101
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,900
好吧  我会问她有没有适合你的朋友
Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.

102
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,070
要漂亮的哦
Hot friend.

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
-行 -还要高挑的
- Right. - And tall.

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,790
我希望我们的孩子能在20岁前
I want our kids to be able to Ride Space Mountain

105
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,760
玩飞越太空山[迪士尼乐园]
Before they're 20.

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,140
我尽力而为
I'll see what I can do.

107
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,260
谢尔顿  猜我今天听到什么
Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?

108
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,380
我能想象你今天听了很多东西
I'd imagine you heard many number of things today.

109
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,550
你来上班肯定会听到  "你好  拉杰"
When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, "hello, Raj.

110
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,770
过得如何  拉杰
"How are you, Raj?"

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
考虑到你今天穿了件新的羊毛背心  会听到"新背心啊"
Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest,

112
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,920
也有可能  虽然可能性很小  听到"羊毛背心很漂亮"
And possibly, though far less likely, "nice sweater-vest."

113
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,440
为什么不干脆让我告诉你今天听到了什么
Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.

114
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,260
因为这可能节约我们的时间
That would probably save us some time.

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,600
星期六晚上在漫画书店
Saturday night at the comic book store,

116
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,280
那里将举办一个"卡亚神秘勇士"锦标赛
They're having a "Mystic Warlords of Ka-Ah" tournament.

117
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,770
第一名有500美金
First prize is $500.

118
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,660
如果我们组队  肯定无敌了
If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.

119
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,570
对不起  拉杰  对于没有挑战性的游戏
I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest

120
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,940
我完全不感兴趣
In playing a game in which I find no challenge.

121
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,480
那钱呢
What about the money?

122
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,590
我有钱啊
I have money.

123
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,320
这钱不一样
This is other money.

124
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,770
那这跟我自己拥有的钱有什么区别
How does it differ from the money I have?

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,010
我要拿一半啊
Half of it will be mine.

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,430
你需要钱买一件不那么惹人嫌的羊毛背心吗
Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?

127
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
莱纳德  救救我吧
Leonard, help.

128
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,750
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,040
我甚至不能说服他给我一张狗日的餐巾纸
I couldn't even talk him into giving one of his freakin' napkins.

130
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,810
天呐  你真是个天才
Wow, you really are a genius.

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,430
不算吧
Not really.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,520
我其实是在网上搜到的这些花式
I googled how to do that.

133
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,170
问一下  你有跟谁有过约定吗
So, listen...Have you ever made a pact with someone?

134
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,010
你是说那种拉勾勾誓言吗
You mean like a pinky swear?

135
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,160
好吧  就算是那种拉勾勾誓言
Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.

136
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,780
一年级时候  我和我朋友萝茜
Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I

137
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,620
约定要嫁给毕特和恩尼
Made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

138
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,290
你知道的  芝麻街里面[美国木偶剧]
You know, from Sesame street?

139
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,990
我跟毕特和恩尼还蛮熟的
I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

140
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,990
然后我们发现都想要嫁给恩尼
Then we find out we both wanted Ernie.

141
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,730
我们直到中学都没再说过话
We didn't speak again until middle school.

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,510
就因为那个木偶
Over puppets?

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,870
各人心头所好啊  莱纳德
The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.

144
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,120
好吧
Okay.

145
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,140
说到心头所好
Speaking of what the heart want-

146
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,760
很久以前
Um, a long time ago,

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,410
我跟沃罗威茨有个约定  其中牵涉到你
I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,660
我不知道接下来你要说什么
Okay, I don't know where you're going with this,

149
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,690
但你最好小心点  因为我们可能因此玩完
But tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,050
不  不  不是那样的
No, no, nothing like that.

151
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,920
交易说的是如果我们当中任意一个有女朋友了
The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend,

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,200
我们就要她介绍她的朋友
We'd have her fix the other one up

153
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,950
给约定的另一方
With one of her friends.

154
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,520
你觉得这种事适合在激情过后马上说吗
And you thought it's a good time to bring this up right after sex?

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,330
我只是很确定在激情之前不会说
Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex.

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,480
而在激情进行时  我在尽力回想在谷歌上看到的花式  所以
And during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so...

157
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,240
我绝不会介绍我的朋友给沃罗威茨
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.

158
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,280
不一定是要好朋友啊
It doesn't have to be a good friend.

159
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,510
而且你也知道他内里其实是个很好的人
And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.

160
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,280
这问题不在于他的内里
The problem isn't what's on the inside.

161
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,540
在于他令人毛骨悚然的淫荡外表
It's the creepy candy coating.

162
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,210
你能好歹考虑一下吗
Will you at least think about it?

163
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,440
就当是帮我个忙
Just as a favor to me?

164
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,260
我最喜欢恩尼的一点
Oh, great thing about ernie,

165
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,050
就是他从不求我什么
Was he never asked me for anything.

166
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,500
他只给予
He just gave.

167
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,100
有了  有了  有了  有了  有了  有了
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,900
《贝蒂与维罗妮卡》
Betty and Veronica?

169
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,420
谢尔顿  新的《绿灯侠》手办明天就到了
Hey, Sheldon, the new Greelantern figurine's coming in tomorrow.

170
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,710
要我给你留一份吗
Want me to set one aside for you?

171
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,080
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,910
你刚刚夺走了我从无意中找到手办
You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine

173
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,680
那种从发现到渴望到占有的
And make the oh-so-satisfying journey

174
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,220
持续快感的机会给抢走了
From discovery to desire to possession.

175
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,480
好吧  那我不给你留了
All right, I won't set one aside for you.

176
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,700
但我必须要拥有它
But I must have it.

177
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,210
-行  那我给你留着  -谢谢
- Okay, I'll set one aside for you. - Thank you.

178
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,220
你知道我本可以在网上买这些的
You know, I can buy all these things online.

179
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,580
我来这是为了个性化服务的
I come here for the personal service.

180
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,600
斯图尔特  威尔·惠顿报名参加了
Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up

181
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,630
这个神秘勇士锦标赛吗
For the Mystic Warlords tournament

182
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,230
就是《星际迷航》里的那个威尔·惠顿吗
The Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

183
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,470
他住在这附近  狂热玩家
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

184
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,890
打扰一下
Excuse me.

185
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,730
你是在说威尔·惠顿  也就是出演了《星际迷航: 下一代》中
Are you saying that wil wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher

186
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,640
卫斯理·柯洛夏少尉的那位

187
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,560
将会参与你的锦标赛吗
Is going to be participating in your tournament?

188
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,920
很抱歉  我又剥夺了你发现这个的机会吗
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?

189
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,150
你不明白的
You don't understand.

190
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,810
我从小到大一直以威尔·惠顿为偶像的
Growing up, I idolizedle Wil Wheaton.

191
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,660
卫斯理·柯洛夏有和我一样的高清图像式记忆
Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.

192
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,790
天呐  多么神奇的巧合啊
Ooh, what a coincidence.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
你也许可以跟他在锦标赛中讨论一下
Maybe you can discuss with him while you're playing in the tournament.

194
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,770

That in 1995, I traveled ten hours by bus

My arduous journey, however, was for naught.

尽管广告说他会出现  却最终没来
Although advertised to appear, he did not show up.

205
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,480
就在那一刻  我发誓要永远憎恨威尔·惠顿
It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

206
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,930

提了我的体脂含量了吗

我还告诉她说

你对你妈有不正常的依恋情结

Say hi to your mother when she picks you up.

249
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,560
还是干脆我告诉他让她晚点来
Or I could just tell her later tonight!

250
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
我们揍得他们屁滚尿流  狂顶你  伙计

I have chased you 'round the moons of Nibia

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,360
越过毁灭的埃姆斯  不找到你誓不罢休
And 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's ames!

255
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,700
你一直引用《星际迷航:愤怒的可汗》里的台词
You know, you keep quoting wrath of Khan,

256
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,980
但他是《星际迷航:下一代》里的人物
But he was in next generation.

257
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,920
角色设定完全不同
It's a totally different set of characters.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,450
肃静
Silence!

259
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,420
还要等多久  才能了却我的复仇夙愿
How much longer must I wait for my revenge?

260
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,390
如果惠顿和斯图尔特赢了这一局
Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match

261
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,040
而我们在下一局只要干掉
And we beat Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants

262
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,260
寂寞拉里和休闲裤队长
In the next round,

263
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,250
我们就会在决赛中碰面
We'll face off for the championship.

264
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,580
那么说  挡在我复仇之路上的
So, my path to satisfaction is blocked

265
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,990
只剩寂寞拉里和休闲裤队长吗
By Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.

266
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,320
好极了
Very well.

267
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,910
非摧毁他们不可
They must be destroyed.

268
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,060
哥们  能别用这种腔调说话了吗
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.

269
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,140
真的很找抽

So, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress

272
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,440
一边念书
To put yourself through grade school.

273
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,560

276
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,530
什么意思
I don'understand.

277
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,190
微生物学不就是研究微小的生物吗
Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.

278

我知道  我学的就是这个

所以我说嘛  因为我小巧玲珑呀
And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing.

280
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,030
我只是在说笑
It's a joke.

281
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,090

No.

288

漫漫长夜啊
Gonna be a long night.

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,940
都是你的错
Well, it's your fault.

290
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,680
我是被逼无奈  又没逼你非答应不可
I had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.

不太喜欢
Not really.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,560
好吧
Okay.

294

303
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,370
"君子报仇  十年不晚"?
"revenge is a dish best served cold" in Klingon?

305
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,330
他有毛病啊
What is wrong with him?

319
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,360
不好意思
Excuse me.

320
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,200
见鬼  是我妈

不过话说回来

If I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.

我妈逼我戴着橡胶手套上幼儿园
My mother made me we rubber gloves to kindergarten

341
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,220
这样就不会从别的孩子那传染到病
So I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.

342
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,580
这没什么
That's nothing.

我妈不让我骑自行车
I couldn't ride a bicle

344

'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.

345
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,590

我肯定成了伤心欲绝的小甜派

我得澄清一下
I should clarify that statement

405
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,970
我这么说是因为  她叫我"小甜派"

406

这是种特别的关系  是吧
