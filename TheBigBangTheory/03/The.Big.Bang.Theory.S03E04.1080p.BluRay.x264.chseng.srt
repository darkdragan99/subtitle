1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,500
每次看这部电影  我都很困惑
This movie baffles me every time we watch it.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,950
什么意思
What do you mean?

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,000
指南说得一清二楚
The instructions are very clear:

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,240
午夜后别喂魔怪
"don't feed the gremlins after midnight."

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,920
别弄湿魔怪
"don't get the gremlins wet."

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,930
这能有多难
How hard is that?

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,850
伙计们好啊
Hi, guys.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,850
好啊  亲爱的
Hi, honey.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,830
好
Hey.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,750
都已经是"亲爱的"啦
Ooh, we're "honey" now, are we?

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,490
对  自从他们发展至肉体关系
Yes. Since their relationship become carnal,

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,110
佩妮就升级了对他的爱称
Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,610
跟她称为"甜心"的人区分
Thus distinguishing him from those she calls "sweetie,"

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,290
通常为了略微消减隐含的讽刺之意
Usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,630
别这么无聊  "甜心"
You're boring people, "sweetie".

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,940
但有时她就是赤裸裸的讽刺
Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,400
你们在干什么
So, what are you guys doing?

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,210
庆祝哥伦布发现美洲纪念日
Celebrating Columbus day.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,660
我们在看《七宝奇谋》《小魔怪》《少年福尔摩斯》
We're watching goonies, gremlins and young sherlock holmes.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,280
都是克里斯·哥伦布的作品
They're all written by Chris Columbus.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,510
好啊
Okay.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,250
那你们感恩节看什么
What do you watch on thanksgiving?

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,420
游行
The parade.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,220
这倒是提醒了我
Oh, you know, that reminds me--

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,940
我通常回内布拉斯加过感恩节
I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving,

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,420
但今年取消了
But this year they're calling it off,

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,230
因为我哥哥被人告了
On account of my brother's trial.

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,930
为什么
What's he on trial for?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,810
只是个误会
Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,400
你应该会喜欢我哥哥
You know, you'd actually like my brother.

31
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,320
他也算是个化学家
He's kind of a chemist.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
既然我今年在这里过感恩节
Anyway, I was thinking I'd have thanksgiving here,

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,570
你们都要来
And you are all invited.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,620
我会去的
Oh. I'll be there.

35
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,710
你是用蔓越橘果冻
Will you be serving cranberry jelly

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,810
还是蔓越橘酱招待客人
Or cranberry sauce?

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
估计两个都有
I guess I could serve both.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,450
估计  貌似你对这方面不在行
You guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,500
佩妮  我很想参加  但每年
Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year,

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,010
我妈都请所有亲戚过来
My mother has all the relatives over and cooks up

41
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,440
做传说中的鸡胸鱼
Her famous tur-briska-fil.

42
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,680
鸡脯鱼?
Tur-briska-fil?

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,130
火鸡包胸脯肉杂  胸脯肉里包鱼丸
Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish.

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,190
没听起来那么好吃
It's not as good as it sounds.

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,770
拉杰  你呢
Raj, what about you?

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,660
他通常都去我家过节  对吧
Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,150
好啦  今年不逼你
All right, this year, you don't have to

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
吃鸡脯鱼啦
Eat the tur-briska-fil.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,450
我根本不嚼
I don't even chew it.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
直接当药丸吞
I swallow it like pills.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
生活大爆炸第三季第四集

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,700
拉杰怎么了
So, what's going on with Raj?

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,650
好消息是
Well, the good news is,

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
我对我妈的鸡脯鱼没意见
He has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.

55
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
真不敢相信  继续说
Hard to believe, but go on.

56
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,020
坏消息是  他要被驱逐出境了
The bad news is, he says he'getting deported.

57
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,210
他要被驱逐出境
What do you mean,

58
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,580
是什么意思
He's getting deported?

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,360
意思是美国政府
I believe it means that the U.S. Government

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,960
要驱赶他离开本国
Is going to expel him from the country.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,050
他要么回印度老家
He could then either return to his native india,

62
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,170
要么移居接受他的国家
Emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him,

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,020
或者去公海当个无国籍海盗
Or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,490
要是我  我就选海盗
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,010
佩妮  你能不能先出去
Penny, would you mind stepping outside

66
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,330
我们才能和他谈谈
So we can speak to him?

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,350
好吧
Fine.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,820
但他也该改改不敢跟女生说话的毛病了
But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.

69
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,390
这也是考虑做海盗的理由
Another reason to consider life of piracy.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,410
即使是今天  海盗仍是男性职业
Even today, I unrstand that's an all-male profession.

71
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,730
好了  她走了
Okay, she's go.

72
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,920
对不起  我失态了
Sorry. I lost my cool.

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,600
怎么回事
So, what's going on?

74
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,090
事情是这样的
Okay, here's the deal:

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,360
六个月前  我的实验
Six months ago, my research testing

76
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,590
测试海王星物体的成分
The predicted composition of trans-neptunian objects

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,050
宣告失败
Ran into a dead end.

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,460
所以?
So?

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,180
我的签证只有在大学任聘才有用
So, my visa's only good as long as i employ to the university.

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,770
如果他们发现我的实验一无所获
And when they find out that I've got squat,

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,700
他们就会裁掉我
They're going to cut me off.

82
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,360
而且  我说的一无所获是一丁点都没有
By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat.

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,430
我倒是希望有那么一丁点收获
I wish I had squat.

84
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,900
等等  那你过去6个月都在做什么
So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?

85
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,980
收收邮件啦
You know, checking e-mail,

86
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,430
更新FACEBOOK页面啦
Updating my facebook status,

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,090
搞搞维基词条啦
Messing up wikipedia entries.

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,110
你们知道吗
Hey, do you know netflix

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,810
NETFLIX现在允许客户端下载电影了
Lets you stream movies on your computer now?

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,990
这么说你一直都拿大学的薪水
And you've continued to take the university's money

91
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,460
蒙混过日子
Under false pretenses?

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
你这个天体物理学家也太没职业道德了
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

93
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,120
不过倒是很适合海盗
Although practically mandatory for a pirate.

94
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,590
我不想回印度
I don't want to go back to india.

95
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,290
印度又热又吵  人又多
It's hot and loud, and there's so many people.

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
你们不知道  到处都是人
You have no idea-- they're everywhere.

97
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,650
伙计们  动动脑子
Okay, guys, think.

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,780
怎么才能让拉杰留下来
How do we keep Raj in the country?

99
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,820
另找一份工作不就行了
Why doesn't he just get another job?

100
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,120
你问我有什么用
What are you asking me for?

101
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,000
我哪知道你能不能说话
I don't know if you can talk now or not.

102
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,090
牛肉
Oh, beef...

103
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,490
我会很想念你的
I'm going to miss you so much.

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,210
知道吗  孟买的麦当劳
Do you know, at the mumbai Mcdonald's,

105
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,550
没有巨无霸
You can't get a big mac?

106
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,050
只有鸡肉大君麦香堡
All you can get is a chicken maharaja mac.

107
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,140
而特制酱料
And the special sauce--

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,850
咖喱  相信我  在印度
Curry-- which, in india, believe you me,

109
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
咖喱一点也不特别
Is really not that special.

110
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,310
别担心  能找到工作的
Don't worry, you'll find another job.

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,110
我先练习一下
Yeah,let me start practicing for it.

112
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,280
"要薯条和大君麦香堡吗"
"do you want fries with maharaja mac?"

113
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,570
好啊  莱纳德
Hi, Leonard.

114
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,830
好啊  拉杰
Hello, Raj.

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,300
你好  谢尔顿
Hello， Sheldon.

116
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,360
不好意思  虽然我还不善长解读面部表情
Forgive me, as you know, I'm no adept at reading facial cues,

117
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,210
但我想试一试
But I'm going to take a stab here:

118
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,360
你不是在伤心就是在反胃中
You're either sad or nauseated.

119
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,080
-我是伤心  -我正准备说伤心的
- I'm sad.  - I was going to say sad.

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,530
不知道怎么的我犹豫了
I don't know why I hedged.

121
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,380
你在吃什么
What are you eating?

122
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,850
曲管通心粉配牛肉酱和番茄酱
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.

123
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,590
噢  牛肉通心粉
Oh, beefaroni.

124
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,640
我最怀念的就会是你了
I think I'll miss you most of all.

125
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,680
我一直对这事儿有些疑惑
I've always been a little confused about this.

126
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,760
为什么印度教不准吃牛肉
Why don't hindus eat beef?

127
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,750
我们相信牛就是神
We believe cows are gods.

128
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,050
学术上说并不准确
Not technically.

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
在印度教中  牛被认为长的像神
In hinduism, cattle are thought to be like god.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,340
不需要你教我自家的文化  谢尔顿
Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon!

131
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,500
就我现在的心情  老子会揪你出去的
In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out--

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,810
我向牛发誓
I swear to cow!

133
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,390
我也是
Me, too.

135
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,780
我只是  我有点激动了
I'm just... I'm a little on edge.

136
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,080
可以理解
Understandle.

137
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,850
你的整个人生仿佛崩溃了
Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you,

138
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,340
你的未来充其量也只能说惨淡无光
And your future appears bleak at best.

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,540
谢谢
Thank you.

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,410
而且你在印度教和牛的问题上是错的
And you're wrong about hinduism and cows.

141
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,290
拉杰  你猜怎么着
Hey, Raj, guess what.

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,290
拉夫林教授正招募人员加入
Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join

143
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,830
恒星进化科研小组
The stellar evolution research team.

144
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,850
真的吗  那太棒了
You-you're kidding! That's fantastic!

145
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,180
那你还在等什么  打电话预约面试啊

147
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,720
这叫高兴  对吗
That's happy, right?

148
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,450
-没错  -搞定
- Yeah.  - Nailed it.

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,260
库萨帕里博士  请进
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

150
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,930
我很惊讶你居然想加入
I was surprised to hear you were interested

151
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,230
我们这个小团队
In joining our little team.

152
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
放弃那些海王星外星体了  是吗
Giving up on those trans-neptunian objects, are we?

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,650
不  不  那是个很有前景的领域
No, no, it's a very promising area.

154
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,230
如果条件理想  我愿意花数年在这课题上
In a perfect world, I'd spend several more years on it.

155
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,450
但我却不能放弃这个机会
But I just couldn't pass up the opportunity

156
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,610
与您共同研究这个令人无比兴奋
To work with you on your tremendously exciting

157
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,320
且还未最终定论的假设上
And not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.

158
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,410
说的太精彩了
Splendid.

159
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
请坐
Uh, please sit down.

160
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,580
要来一杯雪利酒吗
Can I offer you a Sherry?

161
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,450
现在还为时过早  不是吗
It's a little early, isn't it?

162
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,800
我们不在比邻星上[很暗的恒星 意指还早]
Not on Proxima Centauri.

163
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,330
说的太好了
That's very good.

164
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,970
非常有趣  但如果你不介意的话
Jolly amusing, but if you don't mind,

165
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,090
把我那杯留到泰坦星日落之时[土卫六 日落晚]
I'll hold off until suet on Titan.

166
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
说的好
Well done.

167
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,460
我预感你将会
I have a feeling you're going

168
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,010
很好的融入这个团队的  库萨帕里博士
To fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,260
谢谢称赞  先生
Thank you, sir.

170
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,510
不好意思
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
我来晚了吗
Am I late?

172
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,100
不  不  时间正好
No, no, no. Right on time.

173
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,970
库萨帕里博士  请允许我向你介绍
Dr. Koothrappali, may I present

174
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,770
来自麻省理工的麦思彤博士
Dr. Millstone from MIT.

175
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,940
她将领导我们的数据分析小组
She'll be heading up our data analysis team.

176
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,330
很高兴认识你  库萨帕里博士
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali.

177
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,860
我读了您关于柯伊伯带物体大小分布的文章
I read your paper on Kuiper Belt object size distribution.

178
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,920
我非常喜欢
I really enjoy it.

179
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,000
您是如何修正选择偏差的呢
How did you correct for the selection bias?

180
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,630
我进行了模拟测试
Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,380
令我可以修正观测效率
To correct for the observational efficiency.

182
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,130
这实在是太牛了
That's just fascinating.

183
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,710
谢谢
Thank you.

184
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,840
你想在我的热水浴池里了解更多细节吗
Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub?

185
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,560
那  我们什么时候开始呢
So, when do I start?

186
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
你没得到工作是什么意思
What do you mean you didn't get the job?

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,710
你怎么可能得不到
How could you not get it?

188
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,190
你知道的  他是英国人  我是印度人
U know... He's british; I'm indian.

189
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
自甘地之后  他们就对我们不大友好了
Ever since Gandhi, they haven't liked us very much.

190
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,080
等等  你是说他对你有种族歧视
Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you?

191
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,140
因为我们应该提出控告
Because we should file a complaint.

192
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,160
可以是可以
That's okay.

193
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,030
已经有人来控告了
A complaint's been filed.

194
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,080
好了  玩完了
So, that's it.

195
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,670
那是我最后的希望
That was my last hope.

196
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,000
我要被驱除出境了
I'm going to be deported,

197
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,340
狼狈地回到家里
Sent home in disgrace,

198
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,260
被我表亲桑杰冷嘲热讽
Exposed to the sardonic barb of my cousin Sanjay.

199
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,030
或许你们知道他的马甲
Or, as you may know him,

200
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,590
是AT&T的客服人员戴夫
Dave from at&t customer service.

201
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,940
我会很想你的
I'm really going to miss you.

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,570
你会来印度探望我吗
Will you come visit me india?

203
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,740
天  那个  貌似要17小时的飞机吧
Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight.

204
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,410
要不我们在中点相见
How about I meet you halfway?

205
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,850
中点是在离日本海岸线600英里的地方
Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of japan.

206
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,900
干脆这样   我们视频吧
Tell you what, we'll Skype.

207
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,000
先生们
Gentlemen.

208
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,470
-嗨  -拉杰
- Hey.  - Raj,

209
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,440
你得到了拉夫林教授的工作吗
Did you get a job with Professor Laughlin?

210
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,360
-没有  -我猜也是
- No.  - I assumed as much.

211
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,510
但别害怕
But never fear.

212
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,930
就像是无数的动作片里面
Like the subordinate male protagonist

213
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,410
那些次要男主角
In countless action movies

214
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,600
在影片放到一半时消失那样
Who disappears half way through the second reel,

215
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,770
我现在回来拯救世界
I have returned to save the day.

216
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,350
奇怪了
Odd.

217
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,410
他通常都是在欢呼声中回归的
Usually, he's met by cheers.

218
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,140
不论如何  我正想着探索
Anyway, I was thinking about exploring

219
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,460
超弦理论在
The string theory implications

220
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,930
暗物质湮灭时所放出的伽玛射线中的含义
Of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations,

221
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,810
我突然间发现我能利用
And it occurred to me that I could benefit--

222
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,230
打扰一下  谢尔顿
Excuse me, Sheldon.

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,070
通常需要浪费多少卷胶片才能让次要的男主角
How many reels before the subordine male protagonist

224
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,450
说到重点上
Gets to s point?

225
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,240
不好意思  如果你没有为我的出场欢呼
I'm sorry-- if you didn't cheer at my entrance,

226
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,850
那你现在提出你的假设也为时已晚了
It's too late to buy into the premise.

227
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,210
不管怎么说  我从系主任那里
Anyway, I got some extra money

228
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,710
获得了多余的资金
From the head of the department,

229
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,330
而拉杰可以来给我打工
And Raj can come work for me.

230
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,350
你想让我与你共事
You want me to work with you?

231
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,320
是给我打工
For me.

232
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,550
你今后在工作的时候
You're going to have to listen

233
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,920
必须要更仔细的听清我的话
More careful when you're on the job.

234
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,340
好吧  但是可别搞错了
Ay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way,

235
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,480
我情愿在乳头上别张纸
But I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges

236
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,700
赤条条地游过恒河
With a paper cut on my nipple

237
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,100
抑或是染上病毒痛苦而挣扎着死掉
And die a slow, agonizing death

238
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,020
也不要和你一起工作
From a viral infection than work with you.

239
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,770
是为我工作
For me.

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,430
谢尔顿  你在忙吗
Sheldon, are you busy?

241
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
这不废话么
Of course I'm busy.

242
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,800
那要我等你吗
Shall I wait?

243
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
当然了
Yes, please

244
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,530
能为你效劳吗
How may I help you?

245
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,900
我重新考虑了你提出的合作建议
I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.

246
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,740
是为我工作
For me

247
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,040
是是  为你工作
Yes, for you.

248
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,330
我接受  但有几个条件
I do, however, have a few conditions.

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,550
首先  任何情况下
First, at all times,

250
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,030
你都得把我看作同事平等对待
I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal.

251
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,970
其次  在所有发表物上
Second, my contributions shall noted

252
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,130
都应注明我的名字和贡献
In all published material.

253
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,340
第三  绝不许你在我面前
And third, you are never allowed to lecture me

254
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,770
挑剔我的印度教或印度文化
On hinduism or my Indian culture.

255
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,780
真令我感到钦佩  拉杰
I'm impressed, Raj.

256
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,830
你提得条件中肯而合理
Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.

257
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,850
谢谢
Thank you.

258
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,950
我统统拒绝
I reject them all.

259
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,570
那我就毫无选择了
Then you leave me no choice.

260
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,390
只能接受这份工作
I accept the job.

261
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,190
真抱歉  我想你大概搞错了
I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood.

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,120
我才不是请你来工作
I'm not giving you the job.

263
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,240
我只是给你一个机会来应征
I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it.

264
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,530
坐下吧  我们先来面试
Have a seat; we'll get started with the interview.

265
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,700
靠  你开玩笑吗
Wha... You're kidding!

266
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,720
请坐
Please.

267
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,740
好吧
all right.

268
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,130
好吧...
So...

269
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,050
你就穿这个来面试吗
That's what you wear to an interview?

270
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,930
行行好吧  哥们  我们可是多年的老友啊
Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.

271
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,140
哇  开始套近乎了吗
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

272
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,590
谢尔顿  看在老天爷的份上  别逼我求你
Sheldon, for god's sakes, don't make me beg.

273
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,430
逗你玩!
Bazinga!

274
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,610
你是我经典实用笑话
You've fallen victim

275
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,110
的第N个受害者
To another one of my classic practical jokes.

276
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,800
我现在可是老板  你敢说我的笑话不好笑?
I'm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.

277
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,740
二人世界的感觉真棒  不是吗
Ah, this is nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?

278
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,410
唔唔
Uh-huh.

279
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,830
拉杰正和谢尔顿一起工作
Now that raj is working for sheldon,

280
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,850
我就不用开车载他了
I don't have to chauffeur him around anymore.

281
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,950
更重要的是  他们工作到这么晚
plus, yeah, with them working late so much,

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,970
我们就能过二人世界了
We get some privacy.

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,300
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,410
想来点儿刺激的吗
Hey, want to get a little crazy?

285
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,180
你想怎样
What are you thinking?

286
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,480
我们在谢尔顿的专座上狠狠干一场
Let's slide over to sheldon's spot and make out.

287
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,730
你可真是放荡
You are a dirty girl.

288
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,490
天啊  他怎么知道
Oh, god, how did he know?

289
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,440
你们好啊
Hello.

290
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,360
嗨  霍华德
Hi, howard.

291
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,090
我打扰你们了吗
Am I interrupting?

292
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,810
是有一点
Little bit, yeah.

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,300
我应该先打个电话来
Guess I should have called.

294
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,530
说得也是
Yeah, maybe.

295
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,840
今晚我通常都和拉杰一起
Tonight's the night I usually go line dancing

296
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,850
去帕拉米诺跳排排舞
With raj at the palomino.

297
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,150
然后呢
Uh-huh.

298
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,030
但他现在却要和谢尔顿一起工作
But he's working with sheldon.

299
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
我们知道
Yes, we know.

300
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,140
要我走吗
Want me to leave?

301
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,540
也无所谓啦
You know, whatever.

302
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,170
那好  我就在这消磨一会儿好了
Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while.

303
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,530
在看什么呢
So what are we watching?

304
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,150
哇  欲望都市
Sex and the city. Yikes.

305
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,530
别换台  我喜欢这部电影
Hey, I happen to love this mie.

306
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,200
好  那就看吧
Fine, let's watch it.

307
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,960
好像我们的经期同步了哈
Maybe all our periods will synchronize.

308
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,430
好  我们现在要设计一个实验
All right, we're going to be designing an experiment

309
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,410
以观察由于宇宙暗物质的碰撞
To look for the annihilation spectrum

310
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
而产生的光谱湮灭现象
Resulting from dark matter collisions in space.

311
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,750
哇  暗物质耶
Ooh, dark matter.

312
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,420
那我们最好带个手电筒
We better bring a flashlight.

313
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,440
开玩笑而已
I was making a joke.

314
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,730
我才是老板
I'm the boss.

315
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,700
只有我能开玩笑
I make the jokes.

316
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,180
抱歉  你来吧
Sorry go ahead and make your joke.

317
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,450
现在有时间开玩笑吗
This is not the time for joking.

318
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,180
我们可是正儿八经地在做研究
We're doing serious research,

319
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,690
需要完全高度集中精神
Which requires complete and utter focus.

320
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,590
好  那就全力开工吧
All right, let's buckle down and work.

321
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,990
("虎视眈眈"  电影洛奇主题曲  幸存者乐队演奏)
("eye of the tiger" by survivor playing)

322
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,620
-谢尔顿  -咋了
-Sheldon. -What?

323
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,710
有脑残片么
I need an aspirin.

324
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,190
在头个抽屉里
Top desk drawer.

325
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,260
-谢了  -好了吗
-Thank you. -Alright?

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,270
-是  -很好
-Yes. -Good.

327
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,170
真是有趣
That was fun.

328
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,670
谢谢
Thank you.

329
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,890
莱纳德亲亲  我们每一次嘿咻完
Leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you

330
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,260
你不用都说谢谢
Every time we have sex.

331
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,460
噢  好
Oh. Okay.

332
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,510
明天你如果在信箱里看到张卡片
Tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail.

333
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,100
扔了它就是
Just throw it away.

334
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,970
两位早上好啊(爱尔兰腔)
Top o' the mornin'o ya!

335
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,170
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

336
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,660
平时星期天  我都是和拉杰一起
Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with raj

337
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,950
去农贸市场骗骗嬉皮小妞
To scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market,

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,280
但他还在谢尔顿那里工作
But he's still working with sheldon,

339
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,700
所以我想还是到这来
So I thought I'd come over here

340
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,840
给你们做一些炒鸡蛋和意大利香肠
And make you guys scrambled eggs and salami.

341
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,510
最适合刚缠绵过的情侣
It's the perfect meal for apres l'amour.

342
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,790
噢  杀了我吧
Oh, kill me.

343
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,430
顺便  无意中听到你最后那猛地一下
By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish.

344
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,920
真有你的啊  莱纳德
Bravo, leonard.

345
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,190
瞧  如果我说杀了我的时候  你杀了我
See, if you had killed me when I said "kill me,"

346
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,970
我就不会听到了
I wouldn't have had to hear that.

347
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,160
你们有何打算
What do you guys think?

348
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,440
想去看个日场演出吗
Wanna take in a matinee,

349
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,680
还是去溜旱冰
Maybe go rollerblading,

350
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,680
去上节健身踏板课程
Catch a step class?

351
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,860
-你倒是做点什么呢  -好吧
- Do something. - Okay.

352
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,980
霍华德  我们得谈谈
Um, Howard, we need talk.

353
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,240
好啊  怎么了  福尔摩斯
Sure. wats up, Holmes?

354
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,570
你得明白
Uh... Please understand

355
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,390
不是我们不想你呆在这儿
That it's not that we don't want you around,

356
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,730
但我和佩妮偶尔也需要...
But Penny and I occasionally need some...

357
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,080
独处一会儿
Alone time.

358
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,140
我明白了  我当电灯泡了
I-I get it, I'm the third wheel.

359
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
抱歉  我早该明白的
Sorry, I should have seen that.

360
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,520
我这就走
I'll get out of your way.

361
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,010
还有那些鸡蛋...  快趁热吃吧
You're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.

362
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,410
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,430
冰箱里还有熏鲑鱼和奶油芝士
There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge.

364
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,690
百吉饼在烤箱里  我正在加热
The bagels are in the oven.I was warming them up.

365
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,770
太好了
That's great.

366
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,530
我就去跟我妈呆着好了  反正一直都很好玩的
I'm just going to hang out with my mother.That's always fun.

367
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,730
很好
Good.

368
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,210
我们是不是太坏了
Are we terrible people?

369
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,620
我不知道
I don't know.

370
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,060
那你想让我怎么办
What do you want me to do?

371
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,860
去追他吧  带他回来
G-get him; bring him back.

372
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,720
你确定
Are you sure?

373
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,970
-对  -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

374
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,100
霍华德  回来吧
Howard come back.

375
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,520
你们还真让我担心了那么一会儿
Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.

376
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,700
不对  不对
No, no, no, no!

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,300
据我们对本次对撞的预测  这个比率远远过低了
That rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision.

378
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,550
你到底明不明白
Do you understand

379
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,340
我们在讨论的是  暗物质在外层空间的对撞
We're talking about Dark Matter colliding in outer space?

380
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,750
我当然明白
Of course I understand.

381
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,120
你算哪根葱  来跟我讨论外层空间
And who are you to tell me about outer space?

382
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,340
我是天体物理学家
I'm the astrophysicist.

383
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,840
天体  就意味着外太空
"astro" means "space"

384
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,030
天体是指星星
"astro" means "star"

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,050
好吧  这么跟你说吧
Okay, well, let me just tell you,

386
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,380
如果这会儿是用我的母语在跟你争论
If we having this argument in my native language

387
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,630
我早就把你杀得片甲不留
I'd be kicking your butt.

388
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,120
英语本来就是你的母语
English is your native language.

389
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,640
好吧  这个让你说对了  但这边你确实错了
Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!

390
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,860
错误和幻想还是有微妙区别的
There is a fine line between wrong and visionary.

391
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,360
不幸的是  想看我出错  除非你做梦
Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.

392
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,850
我的天  你还真以为蹦到你脑子里的
My god, you think that every thought

393
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,720
每一个想法  一定都是真金不怕火炼的
That comes out of your head is pure gold.

394
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,870
我告诉你
Well, let me tell you something.

395
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,570
你有些想法  它就是一堆粪球
Some of those thoughts are pure caca.

396
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
粪球
Caca

397
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,910
就是一坨屎
It means "doo-doo."

398
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,240
够了
All right!

399
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,630
首先  库萨帕里博士
First of all, Dr. Koothrappali,

400
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,830
我当初提议你跟我共事的时候...
When I first proposed that you work with me..

401
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,730
这么说我是跟你共事咯
Aha! So I am working with you.

402
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,190
在此语境下  "跟我共事"就是指"为我做事"
In this context, "with me" means for me."

403
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,220
好吧  在此语境下...
Ah, well, in this context...

404
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,840
你说我错了  证明给我看
If I'm wrong, prove it.

405
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,340
好吧
Okay.

406
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,880
这里我们推导出了暗物质粒子的质量
Here's where we derive the mass of the Dark Matter particle.

407
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,060
不 不
No, no, no.

408
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,710
你对它原子量的表述是错误的
You've misstated the atomic weight of the target.

409
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,400
-让我说完  -你这是在毁了我的研究
- Let me finish. - You're defacing my work.

410
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,350
不对  我是在修正你的研究
I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.

411
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,100
-把白板擦给我  -不要
- Give me the eraser. - No.

412
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,520
我说了  把白板擦给我
I said give it to me.

413
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,720
有本事就来拿
Come and get it.

414
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,360
好吧
Fine.

415
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,610
上帝啊
Oh, lord.

416
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,330
库萨帕里博士
Dr. Koothrappali,

417
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,920
我以你上级的身份  禁止你在我的白板上写字
As your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!

418
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,420
你才不是我的上级
You are not my superior.

419
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,760
从各方面看  我都占优势
I am in every way.

420
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,790
是吗
Oh, yeah?

421
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,130
这个你能做到吗
Can you do this?

422
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,130
很高兴与您共事
Nice working with you.

423
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,220
抱歉说错了  是为您做事
I'm sorry-- for you.

424
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,850
拉杰
Raj...

425
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,680
拉杰  拉杰
Raj... Raj...

426
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,450
我很忙
I'm busy.

427
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,720
忙什么
Doing what?

428
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,340
好吧  你说得很清楚了
All right, you've made your point.

429
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,440
你来干什么  谢尔顿
What do you want, Sheldon?

430
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,860
我仔细看了板上的内容
I looked over the board

431
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,850
结果证明  你是对的
And it turns out you were right.

432
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,620
-这么说  你错了  -我可没这么说
- So you were wrong. - I didn't say that.

433
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,870
这是唯一合乎逻辑的推理
That's the only logical inference.

434
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,770
尽管如此  反正我没说过
Nevertheless, I didn't say it.

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,770
总之  我想请你回来帮我做事
Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.

436
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,890
是帮你做事还是跟你共事
For you or with you?

437
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,230
在此语境下  "帮我做事"也指"跟我共事"
In this coext "for me" could mean "with me."

438
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,530
好吧  但我有几个条件
All right, but I have some conditions.

439
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,220
-我一概拒绝  -我接受这份工作
- I reject them all. - I'll take the job.

440
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,130
周一见
See you Monday.

441
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,520
等等  你得载我回家
Wait, you have to drive me home.

442
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,970
-你怎么来的  -走路来的
- How did you get here? - I walked.

443
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,970
-那就再走回去  -不行
- So walk home. - I can't.

444
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,490
外面有条大狗...
There's a big dog outside...

445
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,580
回家路上  我们可以开始想想
On the way home, we can start thinking

446
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,870
为500GeV的粒子  优化探测器的办法
About methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GeV particles

447
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,570
好吧
All right.
