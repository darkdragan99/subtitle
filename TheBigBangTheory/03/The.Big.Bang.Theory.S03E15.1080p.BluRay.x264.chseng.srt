1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,930
嗯  我也想你了  亲爱的
Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,770
我得挂了  晚上见吧
Listen, I got to go, but I'll see you tonight?

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,020
好的 拜拜 拜拜
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,850
不  你先挂嘛
No, you hang up first.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,070
喂
Hello?

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,560
老兄  我为你好不容易找到个女朋友而高兴
Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,600
但你非得当着我们这些光棍的面
but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,970
玩那套你亲我热的把戏吗
in front of those of us who don't?

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,540
事实上  他也许该当如此
Actually, he might have to.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,340
在经济学里有种概念被称之为地位商品
There's an economic concept known as a positional good

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,070
它只在持有人手中才能彰显其价值
in which an object is only valued by the possessor

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,770
因为其他人无法拥有
because it's not possessed by others.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,510
这个词由经济学家弗列得·赫希杜撰于1976年
The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,610
用来取代更口语化  但并不准确的"哦也-哦也"[嘲讽]
to replace the more colloquial, but less precise "neener-neener."

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,770
才不是呢
That's not true.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,170
我的快乐不是建立于
My happiness is not dependent

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,640
挚友的杯具与孤独之上的
on my best friend being miserable and alone.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,710
谢谢
Thank you.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,640
当然  要说我没得儿意地笑肯定是说谎了
Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,720
谁杯具和孤独了
Who's miserable and alone?

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,340
我
Me.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,550
我以前也这样 直到我有了女朋友
I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,170
用1976年之前的话来说  "哦也-哦也"
In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,750
嘿  你和伯纳黛特准备如何 共度你们的第一个情人节
Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine's Day?

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,560
啊  我可是绞尽脑汁了
Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,690
华馆提供了39.95美金的情侣特典套餐
There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's.

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
蛋卷啊  饺子啊
Egg rolls, dumplings,

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,890
数不清的炒菜  最后你还能和门口硕大的
bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,720
大理石马合影留念
on the big marble horse out front.

30
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,420
考虑到圣瓦伦丁是个在公元三世纪
Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest

31
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,120
被丢石头和斩首的罗马祭司
who was stoned and beheaded,

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,620
在这个夜晚带着女朋友去看一场残忍的凶杀
wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening

33
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,800
难道不是更合情理的庆祝方式吗
be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,740
我明白你的意思  但是有选择的话
I understand your point, but given a choice,

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,000
犹太人永远选择中国菜
Jews always go with Chinese food.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,890
呃  如果任何人有兴趣
Well, if anyone's interested,

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
今年的情人节
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,390
我会像往年一样
the same way I spend every Valentine's Day.

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,220
从超市买只大烤鸡
Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket,

40
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,060
带回家  站在洗手池边
taking it home, standing over the sink

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,890
像只禽兽一样直接打开包装用手抓着吃
and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,890
很好  那总结一下  一个是大理石骏马
Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse,

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,320
一条愚蠢之极的意见 剩男则独自回家吃鸡
one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken.

44
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,330
让我们看看  还剩谁呢
And let's see. Who's left?

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,620
没错  就剩我的计划了
Oh, that's right. My plans.

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,820
有人想要问一下吗
Isn't anyone going to ask?

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,550
好吧  告诉我们你会和佩妮云雨一番
Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny.

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,250
这不是我想说的
That's not what I was going to tell you.

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,550
没关系 我不介意听听你的性生活
It's okay. I don't mind hearing about your sex life.

50
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,990
只有他的才会让我抓狂
It's his that bugs me.

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,690
你们猜学校要派谁去瑞士
Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,190
参加研讨会并参观欧洲核子研究委员会的超级对撞机
to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,020
就在二月十四日
on February 14?

54
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,120
诺顿教授  尽管原因只有上帝才知道
Professor Norton, although, God knows why.

55
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,690
他自从获得诺贝尔奖之后
He hasn't published anything of note

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,620
就再也没有发表过任何著名的文章
since he won that Nobel Prize.

57
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,290
事实上  诺顿教授去不成了
Actually, Professor Norton can't make it.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,790
他在攀岩的时候把腰扭了
He threw his back out rock climbing.

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,650
我怎么听说他是在攀新女友的高峰时把腰扭了
I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,390
就是第二台的那个爆乳天气女郎吗
The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?

61
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,120
就是她
That's the one.

62
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,720
不管怎样  他们邀请我代替他
In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.

63
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,620
是瑞士还是爆乳天气女郎
In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,450
瑞士
Switzerland.

65
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,450
而且我还能带一个人去
And I get to bring a guest!

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,320
哦  天呐  不可能  老兄
Oh, man! No way, dude!

67
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,490
太难以置信了
This is incredible!

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,990
我太开心了
I'm so happy,

69
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,690
我甚至不想去质疑他们为什么会选你去了
I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you.

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,490
我要速度奔回家收拾行李
I'm just going to run home and start packing.

71
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,390
你怎么不带佩妮去
Why wouldn't you take Penny?

72
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,050
我是要带佩妮去的
I am taking Penny.

73
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,520
那我预测你回家会面临个尴尬的境地
Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,100

帮我参考一下
Help me out.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,770
哪顶滑雪帽比较像超级对撞机
Which ski hat says aprey supercollider?

80
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,740
谢尔顿  我没有选你去瑞士
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
你当然选我了
Well, of course you are.

82
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,600
你还能选谁呢
Who else would you take?

83
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,740
佩妮
Penny.

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,870
什么 这太荒谬了
What? That's absurd.

85
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,270
佩妮对亚原子粒子的研究又不感兴趣
Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.

86
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,070
没错  但那是情人节啊
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

87
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,270
我们可以去观光滑雪
We can go sightseeing and skiing

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,640
然后在熊熊炉火前与皑皑白雪所覆盖的
and make love in front of a roaring fire

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,270
阿尔卑斯山阴中共度春宵

But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.

91
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,400
抱歉  谢尔顿
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,440
抱歉
Sorry?

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
我自从九岁起就一直梦想着有朝一日
I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider

94
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,140
去看大型强子对撞机
since I was nine years old.

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,500
是吗  那我还从六岁起就梦想有朝一日有个女生
Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day

96
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,170
能与我共度情人节呢
with a girl since I was six.

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
太可耻了
Shame on you!

98
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,970
这不是科学家该有的梦
That's no dream for a scientist!

99
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
你要给我什么巨大的惊喜啊
Okay, what's the big surprise?

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
稍等一下
Just a minute.

101
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,740
这个托盘里藏着
This tray contains clues

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,370
你和我如何共度情人节的线索
as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day.

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,670
喔  好吧
Oh. Wow. Okay.

104
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,000
让我看看
Let's see.

105
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,240

106
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,670
瑞士硬干酪  芝士火锅
Swiss cheese, fondue.

107
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,250
我的乳糖不耐症男友要吃完这些
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this.

108
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,040
然后我骑在他背上 直冲月球
Then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?

109
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,540
不对
No.

110
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,170
但的确跟空中旅行有关
But it does involve air travel.

111
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,000
这样吧
Okay, um...

112
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,240
我用"瑞士"军刀 切一片"瑞士"干酪
let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife,

113
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,840
你可以把它加到一杯 "瑞士"小姐速溶可可里
and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,970
嗯  我觉得瑞士应该是个关键词了
Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.

115
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,140
没错
Uh-huh.

We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?

117
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,500
这怎么会跟空中旅行有关
How does that involve air travel?

118

去迪士尼世界玩马特洪雪橇过山车[奥兰多  佛罗里达]
We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?

119

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,170
亲爱的  开始是挺好玩的 但现在没意思了

我们要去瑞士滑雪
We're going skiing in Switzerland?!

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
你滑  我会摔倒  不过是的
Well, you'll ski, I'll fall, but, yeah,

126
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,440
我们要去瑞士过情人节
we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day.

127
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,450
天啊  莱纳德 太好了
Oh, my God, Leonard! That's incredible!

128
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,450
别高兴得太早
Not so fast.

129
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,750
先别急着点 你的芜菁灯吧  佩妮
You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.

130
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,310
芜什么玩意儿
Rabe-what-ly?

131
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,980
芜菁灯 芜菁灯
Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light

132

Which you will not be celebrating

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,580
原因之一  节日在秋季
because A: these festivals occur in the fall;

136
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,050
原因之二
and B:

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,750
你去不了瑞士
you will not be going to Switzerland.

138
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,380

我带佩妮去
I'm taking Penny.

140
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,250
估计不行 你还认得这个吗
Afraid not. Do you recognize this?

141
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,250
别提室友协议
Not the roommate agreement.

142
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,150
正是室友协议
Indeed, the roommate agreement.

143
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,950
请您注意友谊附加条款
I call your attention to the Friendship Rider

144

大型强子对撞机

148
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,980
该人应邀请另一位朋友相陪
he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."

149
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,580
偶滴神啊
Oh, for God's sakes.

150
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,310
你们连这个也写进协议里吗
You actually put that in an agreement?

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
里面还写了
Yeah. We also put in what happens

152
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,110
如果一人得了麦克阿瑟天才奖怎么办
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant,

153

He can't kill me, even if I turn.

156
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,450
里面没写一人有了女友怎么办吗
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,950
没有  那个有点太不着调了
No, that seemed a little farfetched.

158
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,680
谢尔顿  你真打算强制实施这个吗
Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?

159
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,880
我一直遵守
I've lived up

160
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,550
协议里的所有义务
to all my commitments under the agreement.

161
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,950
每天至少问候你一次
At least once a day I ask how you are,

162
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,410
即使我一点都不在意
even though I simply don't care.

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,780
我没有
I no longer

164
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,880
在晚上十点后进行生物危害演习了
stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10:00 p.m.

165
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,510
我也放弃学习图瓦喉唱了
And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.

166
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,780
-我知道不该问  不过什么是  -别啊
- Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is...? - No.

167
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,780
如果允许我训练  我能唱得更好
I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice.

168
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,710
谢尔顿 我知道协议这么写
Look, Sheldon, i know it's in the agreement,

169
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,050
如果你真的变成僵尸  我保证不杀你
and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you.

170
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,180
我宁愿让你喝我脑浆
In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.

171
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,280
但我还是要带佩妮去瑞士
But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.

172
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,780
这是你的最终决定吗
Is that your final decision?

173
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,780
没错
It is.

174
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,750
很好
Very well.

175
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,530
他不会罢休  对吧
It's not over, is it?

176
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,630
你以为呢
What do you think?

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,040
今早的车挺多啊
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,300
你觉得会下雨吗
Think it's gonna rain?

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
今天早上
Instead of underpants,

180
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,500
我把土豆沙拉当内裤穿了
I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning.

181
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,330
有啥想法
Thoughts?

182
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
我知道怎么让你高兴
Okay, I know what'll cheer you up.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
我们玩你的开车游戏吧
Let's play one of your driving games.

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
好啊
All right.

185
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,740
游戏名就叫叛徒
This game is called Traitors.

186
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,600
我说三个历史人物
I will name three historical figures,

187
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,940
你以背叛行为的罪恶程度
you put them in order

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,740

你真觉得我跟他们是一类人吗
You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?

191
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,140
你说得对
You're right.

192
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,100
犹大至少为自己的作为 以死谢罪了
Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.

193
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,980
别这样  谢尔顿 你就不能理解一下
Come on, Sheldon. Can't you at least try to understand

194
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,070
这对我有多重要吗

200
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,840
对不起昨晚不能陪你
I'm sorry I couldn't hang with you last night.

201
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,300
我和伯纳黛特约会了
I had a date with Bernadette.

202
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,500
我知道

205
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,170
没干什么
Not much.

热了块玉米馅饼

对  他觉得我背叛了他

我会带谢尔顿去瑞士
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.

214

真的假的
Seriously?

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,340
当然了
Absolutely.

216
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,570
再把他扔在那里
And I'd leave him there.

217
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,900
这是什么情况
What the hell is that?

218
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,940

222
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,000
搞什么
What's going on?

223
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,830
我给你做了早餐
I've made you breakfast.

224
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,860
有果汁和咖啡
Juice, coffee,

225
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,860
还有一些薄饼
and pancakes in the shape of some

226
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,760
上面是你最爱的虚构角色
of your favorite fictional characters.

227
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,800
瞧  这是弗罗多[出自《魔戒》]
See, here's Frodo.

228
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,960
你居然做了弗罗多薄饼
You made Frodo pancakes?

229
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,030
脚毛部分我用的是椰子刨花

我已经彻底清洗干净
that I thoroughly laundered

233
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,560
松软程度正适宜用来盖薄饼
and pressed into service as a pancake cozy.

234
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,100
你有什么目的
Why are you doing this?

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,230
对我近来的行为表示歉意
It's by way of an apology for my recent behavior.

236
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,330

I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
友谊不能依靠那堆 白纸黑字的协定来维系
that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements.

238
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,430
而需要两人之间 互相尊重和体谅
It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other.

239

What you're tasting is respect and affection.

243
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,100
当然还有一磅左右植物白油
And about a pound of Crisco.

244
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,900
待你用完早餐 我觉得  今天我们可以

watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.

246
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,330
你不是讨厌《巴比伦5号》吗
You hate Babylon 5.

247
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,760
当然  既没剧情又不科幻
I do. It fails as drama/science fiction,

248
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,800
彻头彻尾的仿制大烂片
and it's hopelessly derivative.

249
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,760
但是你喜欢  而我们又是朋友
But you like it, and you're my friend.

250
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,900
好吧  赞
Okay, great.

251
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,930
我还是不会带你去瑞士

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,700

Drat.

253
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
没你的弗罗多尝了
No Frodo for you.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,840
你好
Hello.

255
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,240
好啊
Hello.

256
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
得  我们就省掉假惺惺的友好吧
All right, let's dispense with the friendly banter.

257
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,040
你应该知道我为何来此
I believe you know why I'm here.

258
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,540
关于这点  我一直认为
Well, I always figured it was to study us,

259
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,700
你是来发现我们地球人的弱点
discover our weaknesses,

260
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,200
再报告给你们的外星君主
and report back to your alien overlords.

261
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,170
搞笑
Yes, amusing.

262
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,630
特定情报  对你而言
Extraordinary intelligence

263
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,430
貌似是显得像天外来客般难懂
might well appear extraterrestrial to you,

264
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
但我还是友情提醒下 确切地说
but let me be more specific.

265
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,270
你应该知道我为何在此  这个洗衣间里
I believe you know why I'm here in the laundry room.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,640
喉音唱腔在这里有更好的音响效果吗
Better acoustics for your throat singing?

267
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,240
还真不赖嘛
It's actually not bad.

268
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,570
但我来此的真正目的
But my true purpose in being here

269
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,440
是来做一个简要的幻灯片演说
will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation.

270
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,040
关灯

273
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,040
发言人  谢尔顿·库珀博士
a PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.

274
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,970
我的老天爷
Oh, for God's sake.

275
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,100
这是一位在粒子物理学领域的
Here we have a highly gifted researcher

276
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,170
超级天才科学家
in the field of particle physics

278
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,770
从此改变对宇宙的理解
of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe.

279
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,340
确切来说就是我
AKA me.

280
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,370
而这是一位女招待
And here we have a waitress

281
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,770
只会用手指抠牙齿而已
brushing her teeth with her finger.

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
确切来说就是你
AKA you.

283
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,200
不好意思
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,670
这算是在奉承我吗
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?

285
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,770
请等演讲结束后再提问
Please hold all questions till the end of the presentation.

286
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,440
这是瑞士欧核中心的
This is the Large Hadron Collider

287
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
大型强子对撞机
at CERN in Switzerland,

288
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,740
经由数十年规划和建构而成
the product of decades of planning and construction.

289
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,670
是全世界物理学家心目中的圣地
It is a Mecca for physicists the world over.

290
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,200
而这是科罗拉多大街的
This is Bath and Body Works

291
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,240
Bath and Body Works[某品牌]沐浴乳商店
on Colorado Boulevard.

292
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,240
他们卖香皂和乳液
They sell scented soaps and lotions,

293
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,240
外加一些小闪饰品
some of which contain glitter.

294
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,600
现在我们来配对
Now, let's see if we can match the individual

295
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,640
这两个人以哪个地方作为目的地比较合适
to the appropriate destination.

296
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,000
好吧
O-kay.

297
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,200
别闹了
Show's over.

298
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,640
还没完呢
No, it's not.

299
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,800
我还有五张幻灯片没讲
I've got five more slides.

300
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,300
谢尔顿  这是莱纳德的决定
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.

301
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,740
他邀我去瑞士  我也很想去
He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,930
好吧
Very well.

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,930
玩得开心
Enjoy yourself.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
你将亲眼目睹
You're going to be in the presence of something

305
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,470
我所梦寐以求了十多年的伟大成就
that I've dreamed of seeing for decades.

306
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,800
希望你能明白
I just hope you'll be able to appreciate

307
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,700
这其中所包含的重要意义
the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.

308
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,240
我会和莱纳德谈谈
I'll talk to Leonard.

309
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,400
真的吗
You will?

310
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,000
对
Yes.

311
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,970
既然对你而言意义重大  那应该让你去
If it means that much to you, you should go.

312
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
谢谢你  佩妮
Oh, Penny, thank you!

313
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,200
没什么
You're welcome.

314
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
我不怎么抱人
Since I rarely hug,

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,400
要抱多久就听你的
I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration.

316
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,940
我觉得差不多了
I think we're there.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,840
好极了
Oh, good.

318
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,770
拜啦
Bye-bye.

319
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,200
你猜怎么着
You know what?

320
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,700
没有马子又怎样
Even though I don't have a girlfriend,

321
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,690
情人节老子照样可以好好过
I can still have a good time on Valentine's Day.

322
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,370
听我的吧  这不可能 我早试过了
Trust me, you can't. I've tried.

323
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,200
不  我准备好好过我自己的情人节
No, no, no, I'm going to have a "me" day.

324
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,930
首先  去韩国城找家店做个SPA
First I'm going to go to one of those SPAs in Koreatown,

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,700
蒸个桑拿  找人按摩一下
take a steam and get a massage.

326
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,900
然后去宠物店  找条小狗狗来舔舔我
Then I'm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.

327
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,770
谢尔顿 我得跟你谈谈
Sheldon, I need to talk to you.

328
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,370
好的  朋友 来点Cholermus煎饼尝尝吗
All right, my friend. Would you like some Cholermus?

329
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,370
尝什么
Some what?

330
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,060
Cholermus煎饼 一种传统的瑞士早餐
Cholermus. It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.

331
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,260
我正在训练我的消化系统
I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system

332
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,290
习惯瑞士菜特殊的烹饪方法
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.

333
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
又轮不上你去瑞士
You're not going to Switzerland!

334
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,190
但我要去
Oh, but I am.

335
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,990
佩妮没告诉你最新的好消息吗
Didn't Penny tell you the good news?

336
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,660
她跟我说  你背着我去找她
She told me that you went behind my back

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,690
让她觉得内疚  主动提出让你替代她去瑞士
to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.

338
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,920
对  就是这个好消息
Yes, that good news.

339
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,860
想都别想  我才是受邀的人
Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited.

340
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,390
只有我能决定找谁同行
I get to decide who goes with me,

341
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,060
我决定找佩妮  而不是你
and it's Penny, not you!

342
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,890
霍华德  把灯光调暗点好吗
Howard, could you lower the lights?

343
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,890
我做了段简短的幻灯片演示文稿
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.

344
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,290
没必要看什么演示
I don't need to see your presentation.

345
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,190
讨论到此为止了
This discussion is over!

346
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,190
这回答有够模棱两可的
That's a somewhat ambiguous response.

347
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,820
到底带不带我去
Am I going or not?

348
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,160
谢尔顿  事已至此
Sheldon, at this point,

349
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,590
我宁愿自己去  也不带你
I would go by myself before I would take you.

350
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
真的
Really?

351
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,020
真的
Yeah, really.

352
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,190
好吧  那我也别无选择了
Well, then, you leave me no alternative.

353
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,890
从现在起
From this moment forward,

354
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,060
我们可以当室友  但不再是朋友了
we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.

355
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
很遗憾你这么觉得
I'm sorry you feel that way.

356
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,720
我认为你还未充分意识到
I don't think you're fully aware

357
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,060
此事的后果  莱纳德
of the ramifications here, Leonard.

358
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,520
你何不指点一下
Why don't you enlighten me?

359
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,190
既然我们"室友协议"中的友谊条款无效了
With the friendship clause of our Roommate Agreement nullified

360
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,460
等我受邀去比尔·盖茨家游泳的时候
you are no longer entitled to accompany me

361
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,920
你也就失去了随同一起去的资格
to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.

362
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,060
那可伤大了
Ooh, that's gotta sting.

363
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,420
想想看  明天这个时候
Just think, this time tomorrow

364
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,760
我们已经在瑞士日内瓦 共度我俩第一个情人节了
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day.

365
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,260
是啊
I know!

366
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,590
我今天特地去逛街
I went shopping today

367
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,920
专门为此行买了件小内内呢
and bought special undies for the occasion.

368
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,190
保暖吗  那边会很冷哦
Thermal?'Cause it's gonna be cold.

369
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,190
再好好想想  莱纳德
Think it through, Leonard.

370
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,020
祝你健康[用于对刚打喷嚏者的祝愿]
Gesundheit.

371
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,520
或者学他们瑞士人讲话
Or as they say in Switzerland,

372
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,020
祝您健康
Gesundheit.

373
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,060
你感冒了吗
You getting a cold?

374
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,160
不  可能只是有点过敏
No, no, it's probably just allergies.

375
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,690
想吃点抗过敏药吗
Do you want an allergy pill?

376
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
我啥都有哦
'Cause I have 'em all.

377
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,490
处方药  非处方药
Prescription, nonprescription,

378
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,520
进口药  国产药  实验性药物
foreign, domestic, experimental.

379
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,290
有管用的吗
Do any of them work?

380
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
没  我只是喜欢收集
Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.

381
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,040
佩妮
Penny?

382
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,870
你还好吧
You okay?

383
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
我听起来很好的样子吗
Did that sound okay to you?

384
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,370
别进来
Do not come in here!

385
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,870
怎么回事
What's going on?

386
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,200
我这儿开茶话会呢
I'm having a tea party.

387
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,540
不然你以为怎么回事
What do you think's going on?

388
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,440
我想我可能得了流感
I think I might have the flu.

389
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,600
要不就是瘟疫
Or the plague.

390
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,670
我们是早上9点的飞机
Well, our plane leaves at 9:00 a.m.

391
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,670
你觉得到那时你会感觉好点吗
Do you think you'll feel better by then?

392
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,200
会的
Yep.

393
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,240
因为那时我早已痛苦至死了
'Cause I'm gonna be dead.

394
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,770
谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon?

395
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
佩妮病得很重
Listen, Penny is pretty sick

396
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,870
不能去瑞士了
and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland.

397
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,670
你还有兴趣的话  欢迎随我一起去
So if you're still interested, you're welcome to come.

398
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,870
太好了
Great.

399
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,140
我这就去收拾行李
I'll start packing.

400
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,840
等我一下
In a minute.

401
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,700
Cholermus煎饼都吐出来了
Oh, look, it's the Cholermus.

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
你的汤
Here's your soup.

403
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,200
-鸡汤  -对
- Chicken? - Yes.

404
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,170
-加了点小点缀的  -对
- With the little stars? - Yes.

405
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,770
加热到180度
Heated to 180 degrees?

406
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,830
不如我倒你膝盖上  你来告诉我到底几度
Why don't I pour it in your lap and you can tell me?

407
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,300
不必这么刻薄吧
You don't have to be mean.

408
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,500
我是病人
I'm sick.

409
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,400
是啊  我也是病人

不关我事

411
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,930
我就是想不明白  我怎么会生病的

412
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,270
我对个人卫生一向一丝不苟

413
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,570
还定期给双手消毒

414
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,600
一般来说  还都避免接触到别人
and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.

415
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,070
我不知道怎么说  谢尔顿

417
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,400
不客气

418
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,970
是你
It's you!

419
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,900
我拥抱过你
I touched you!

420
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,570
情人节快乐
Happy Valentine's Day.

421
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,330
天哪  看看这房间
Oh, my goodness, look at this room!

422
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,330
香槟
Champagne!

423
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,330
玫瑰
Roses!

424
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,370
还有巧克力
And little chocolates!

425
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,730
这一定是我有生以来最棒的情人节
This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.

426
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,900
对了  我忘了还准备了这些
Yeah, I forgot about all this.

427
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,870
但我可永世难忘
But I never will.
