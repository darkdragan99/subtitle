I-I've read both your books and most of your papers.

139
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,780
我叫莱纳德  就住这儿  你太有才了
I-I'm Leonard, I live here, you're brilliant.

140
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,840
真不好意思
I apologize.

141
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,310
他只是个搞实验物理的
He's only an experimental physicist.

142
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,850
没关系
No need to apologize.

143
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,550
我有几个好朋友也是搞实验的
Some of my best friends are experimental physicists.

144
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,550
其实也不算好朋友  就是认识而已
Well, not my best friends, but I know them.

145
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,490
我最要好的朋友
My best friend is

146
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,190
是一位名叫温迪的分子化学家
a molecular chemist named Wendy.

147
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,190
真不好意思  我话太多了
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

148
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,190
你嗨
Hi-lo.

149
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,800
你饿吗  渴吗
Are you hungry, thirsty?

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
我来招待你吧
Can I offer you anything?

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,170
不用了  她是我的客人
No, she's my guest.

152
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,970
要招待她的话  也该由我来吧
If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me.

153
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,900
伊丽莎白  我能为你效劳吗
Elizabeth, can I get you something?

154
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,440
你想要女性卫生用品
Perhaps a feminine hygiene product

155
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,110
还是调节肠道的酸奶
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

156
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,880
这俩选项都很有意思嘛
Interesting choices.

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,740
考虑到我现在的需求  还是酸奶吧
Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

158
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
好极了
Excellent.

159
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,080
要是这酸奶起作用的话
If the yogurt works,

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,880
我还买了些香薰蜡烛
I bought some delightful scented candles.

161
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,690
这是你耶
Look, it's you.

162
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,160
非常感谢你们让我住在这里
Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,230
谁愿意住宾馆啊
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

164
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,970
窗户又打不开  诡异的卡片式钥匙
Windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.

165
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,400
知音啊  我太高兴了
I'm so glad you understand.

166
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,810
不对  他不是你的知音
No, he doesn't understand.

167
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,840
我才是
I understand.

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
我也是啊
Well, I understand, too.

169
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,640
你剽窃了我的想法
You're just misappropriating my understanding.

170
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,420
我觉得任何一所大学都想要你
I think any university would want you.

171
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,250
当然  除了那些 已经接纳你的大学
Except, of course, any university that had already had you.

172
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,190
因为他们在接纳你之前  已经想要你了
Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.

173
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,630
这就是跟你说"你嗨"的那位
From the mind that brought you "hi-lo."

174
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,200
我带你去房间看看吧
Let me show you to your room.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,300
好啊
All right.

176
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,200
我也觉得我困了  晚安  莱纳德
I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,970
好安
Uh, sleep night.

178
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,570
我想说  晚安
I mean, obviously, good night.

179
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,870
我本来想说"好梦"
I started to say "sleep tight,"

180
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,840
然后我又中途改了主意
then I changed my mind in the middle.

181
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
我对天发誓  我很聪明的
I swear to god, I'm smart.

182
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,550
说都不会话了  伙计
Get it together, man.

183
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,790
好的  给你展示一下
All right, let me show you

184
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,990
这个房间里的一些功能吧
some of the features of the room.

185
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,560
首先  窗户
First, windows.

186
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
很常见
Conventional.

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,190
打开  关上
Open, closed.

188
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,490
打开  关上
Open, closed.

189
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,930
开一半
Halfway open.

190
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,660
或者说关一半  这取决于你的哲学取向
Or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent.

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,970
这里是我的漫画收藏 可以随意浏览
Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse.

192
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,070
这里有一盒阅读专用的一次性手套
There's a box of disposable reading gloves

193
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,540
就在床头柜上
on the night stand.

194
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,040
很好
Good to know.

195
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,480
在这里 你可以找到应急储备
In here, you'll find emergency provisions.

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,510
足够八天的食物和水  一把弩
An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow,

197
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,120
一个高密度优盘  里面有 原版的《星际迷航》第二季
Season 2 of Star Trek the original series on a high-density flash drive.

198
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,990
那要是所有的USB接口都在 灾难中坏掉了呢
What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?

199
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,890
那就真的没法儿活了  不是吗
Then there's really no reason to live, is there?

200
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,730
我能问个关于你室友的问题吗
Can I ask a question about your roommate?

201
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,460
他是个蠢货  对吧
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

202
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,630
他的情感生活是个什么状态
What's his relationship status?

203
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,570
他跟住在走廊对面的那个女服务员
Well, there was a misbegotten adventure

204
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,800
有过一段奸情
With a waitress who lives across the hall.

205
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,070
莫名其妙开始  又莫名其妙结束
It ended as inexplicably as it began.

206
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,810
他俩没有什么共同点
They had very little in common,

207
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,610
除了床笫之欢
except for carnal activity.

208
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,680
这就是为什么
That's why I acquired

209
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,150
我准备了这副隔音耳麦
these noise-canceling headphones.

210
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,980
如果你打算用它的话
If you decide to use them,

211
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,750
请记得戴完之后用湿巾把耳罩擦干净
please clean the ear pieces afterwards

212
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,890
湿巾就在卫生间里
with the wet wipes you'll find in the bathroom.

213
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,360
有个贴着"湿巾"标签的抽屉
They're in the drawer labeled "wet wipes."

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
行
Okay.

215
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,630
很好  那就不打扰你晚上梳洗时间了
Good. I'll leave you to your nighttime ablutions.

216
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,860
早上卫生间的使用时间表已经发你邮箱
I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule.

217
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,600
欢迎礼包里还有一份塑封过的版本
You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet.

218
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,940
就印在紧急逃生线路图的背面
It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.

219
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,970
真体贴
How thoughtful.

220
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,170
-睡个好觉  朋友  -你也是
- Sleep well, my friend.  - You, too.

221
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,410
让我再拿一样东西
Oh, let me just get one thing.

222
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,910
这是我的备用应急储备包
It's my backup emergency supply kit.

223
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,220
客厅的紧急逃生路线不经过这边
The living room escape route doesn't pass through here.

224
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,450
晚安
Now, good night.

225
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,920
如果世界末日降临的话  祝你好运
And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.

226
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,990
请进
Yes?

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,900
我看见你的灯还亮着
I saw your light on.

228
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,170
你没事吧
Is everything all right?

229
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,030
没事  我就是睡不着
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

230
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,870
我也睡不着
Me neither.

231
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,570
你看我在读什么
Oh, look what I'm reading.

232
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,310
你的书哦
It's you.

233
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,940
你不是读过了吗
I thought you already read it.

234
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,340
是读过  不过有一阵子了
I did, but it's been a while,

235
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,910
我想在早餐时表现得聪明点
And I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.

236
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,910
你很聪明了
Aw, you're smart.

237
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,980
是吗  太好了
Oh, good.

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,580
我还担心你没看出来
Wasn't sure it was coming across.

239
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,890
在读第几章
What chapter are you on?

240
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,420
第六章
Uh, six.

241
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,420
银河系外距离等级
Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder.

242
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,030
想知道一个小秘密吗
Want to know a little secret?

243
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,760
当然
Sure.

244
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,330
威尔逊-巴普效应那一节 我是全裸着写的
I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu effect completely naked.

245
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,270
真的吗
Really?

246
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,510
读起来可不像
Uh, sure doesn't read that way.

247
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,470
我来给你演示
Here, let me show you.

248
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,050
考虑到脉动变星的亮度变化
When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars,

249
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,250
这可能就是
we start to see a possible explanation

250
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,990
哈勃常数出现数值分歧的原因之一
for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble's constant.

251
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,330
你的科学真是活色生香
You really make science come alive.

252
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,200
语音测试  清晨语音测试

昨晚过得愉快吗
I trust you had a pleasant night.

260
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,510
不是一般愉快
More than pleasant.

261
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,120
失陪一下  我要去方便
Excuse me, I'm going to relieve myself.

262
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,790
喝什么咖啡
How do you take your coffee?

263
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,830
-清咖啡  -好滴
- Black. - Okeydoke.

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
为休斯顿而尿  为奥斯丁而尿
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin,

265
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,500
为我深爱的州而尿
pee for the state my heart got lost in.

266
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,140
再为德州抖两抖
And shake twice for Texas.

267
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,610
他妈妈教他的
Something his mother taught him.

268
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,850
好了  伊丽莎白 轮到你用卫生间了
All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.

269
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,150
坐垫我放下了  为保护你健康还消了毒
The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.

270
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,120
你真细心  不过我想先喝完咖啡
That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

271
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,260
看来酸奶是没起作用
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

272
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,630
我要火速去给生产商写邮件指责他们
I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.

273
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,100
太好了  你们都起了 我的车发动不了
Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start.

274
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,300
需要有人送我上班
I need a ride to work.

275
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,670
又对检查引擎灯置之不理了
Did you once again ignore your "check engine" light?

276

不是  大明白先生
No, Mr. Smarty-pants.

277
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,010
我这次没理加油提示灯
I ignored the "fill gas tank" light.

278
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,800
莱纳德  佩妮来查探下
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any

279

你是否对她余情未了
residual feelings you have for her

280
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,480
以达到搭车上班的目的
in order to get a ride to work.

281
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,520
好  当然  等我把咖啡倒旅行杯里
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.

282
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,050

是的  非常好

太棒了  无意义的客套话交流完毕
Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished.

Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up,

296
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
相信我  在他后面去可不是好事
and believe me, you do not want to follow him.

297
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,650
失陪了
Excuse me.

298
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,990
好吧  我看我得去换衣服了
Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed

299
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,590
好送大家去上班
so I can take everyone to work.

300
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,790
你  谢尔顿
You and Sheldon

301

普林顿博士  你刚见过的

Gonna be fun.

304
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,470
就像玩具车
Like a clown car.

305
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,500
等等
Hang on. Hmm?

306
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,170
哦  什么事
Yeah? What? Huh?

307
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,840
我们刚刚分手
We just broke up.

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
什么...  你我吗  是哈
Wha... uh, you and me? Yeah, we did.

309
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,000
不久之前
Not too long ago.

310
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,810
你适应得如何
How are you doing with it?

311
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,980
明显没你适应得好
Not as good as you apparently.

312
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,510
我什么  没明白
I, um, I don't follow.

313
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,110
知道吗  这不不关我的事
You know what? It's, it's none of my business.

314
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,080
我们刚刚分手
If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy

315
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,380
你就想和谢尔顿的博士朋友上床  那就去吧
right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.

316
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,220
打扰一下
Excuse me.

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,020
我对你提议莱纳德
I'm uncomfortable with you recommending

318
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,520
争取与普林顿博士性交感到不安
that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton,

319
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,090
她可还有更重要的事要忙
who I assure you has better things to do.

320
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,230
我不是提议
I'm not recommending it.

321
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,160
他已经那样做了
I'm saying it already happened.

322
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,630
这太荒谬了
That's preposterous.

323
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,630
是吧  莱纳德
Tell her, Leonard.

324
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,500
那个...
Well...

325
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,440
不是吧
No.

326
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
拜托  不是我的错
Come on. It wasn't my fault.

327
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,020
莫非你是想说你不小心绊倒 正好摔她身上了
The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?

328
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,950
算了 我还是坐公车上班吧
You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.

329
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,250
佩妮  让我开车送你吧
Penny, I can still drive you.

330
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,320
算了  不必了
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

331
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,690
我怕你踩到香蕉皮 然后把我搞怀孕了
You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.

332
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,360
我必须要说  你的背叛真令我震惊
I must say, i'm shocked by this betrayal.

333
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,900
我没有背叛佩妮
I didn't betray Penny.

334
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,330
不是佩妮  是我
Not Penny, me!

335
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,000
我怎么背叛到你了
How am I betraying you?

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,170
伊丽莎白是我的朋友  你却跟她玩
Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her!

337
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,910
好吧  确实玩了
Yeah, I guess I did.

338
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,750
你这是干什么呢
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,320
[奈奎尔: 一种夜间使用的感冒药]
别紧张  这是奈奎尔
Relax, it's NyQuil.

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,190
你感冒还没好
You still have a cold?

341
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,930
或许吧  可我不在乎
Maybe, but I don't care.

342
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,030
这就是奈奎尔的妙处  里面有10%的酒
That's the great thing about NyQuil, it's like ten-percent booze.

343
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,670
我叫它一夜鼻涕喷嚏咳嗽不断
I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing

你晚上睡不着吗
Are you having trouble sleeping?

346
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,210
要知道  我可是一夜没睡啊
'cause, boy, I was up all night.

347
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,770
你也感冒了吗
Did you get a cold, too?

348
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,510
不  但我整夜都没睡哟
No, but I was awake all night.

349
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,850
想吃药的话
If you want,

350
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,890
我可以给你些我妈的安眠药
I can give you some of my mom's sleeping pills.

351
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,890
要是少了她不会发现吗
She won't notice they're missing?

352
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,960
她都没发现自己在吃安眠药
She doesn't know she takes them.

353
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,260
没事
No, that's okay.

354
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,190
是其它事让我整夜不睡
It was something else keeping me up last night.

355
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,130
今早也是哦
And again this morning.

356
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,970
我也不介意哟
And... I didn't mind.

357
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
我昨晚没睡
I was up last night.

358
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,310
今早也没睡
I was up this morning.

359
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,270
我也不介意
I didn't mind.

360
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,480
都提示你们这么多了
Those are your clues.

361
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,980
你窗台上的鸽子又孵了一窝小鸟吗
Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?

362
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,720
不是
No.

363
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,390
你又不睡整什么乐高动画电影了吧
Were you up making another stop-motion lego movie?

364
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,860
不是
No.

365
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,160
告诉你吧
'cause let me tell you,

366
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,690
光是让乐高玩具动起来可不够
It's not enough to make the legos move,

367
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,900
还要让他们有爱  懂吗
They also have to capture your heart.

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,930
再提示一下
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

369
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,370
还涉及到另一个人
It involved another person.

370
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,600
你搞了个日本性爱抱枕吗
Did you get a Japanese love pillow?

371
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,840
日本性爱抱枕能算人吗
How is a japanese love pillow another person?

372
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,510
要是你爱她  又给她起名字  当然算
It is if you love her and give her a name.

373
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,050
普林顿博士  我来给你介绍我的同事
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues--

374
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,720
这位是拉杰·库萨帕里博士
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali

375
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,780
和不是博士的霍华德·沃罗威茨
And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.

376
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,620
-我是的忠实粉丝  -多谢
- I'm a big fan of your work. - Thank you.

377
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,830
不用我说  你和霍夫斯塔德博士 已经互相认识过了
And of course, you've already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.

378
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,230

Hey, you.

379
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,360
你也好呀
Hey, you.

380
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,130
天  我可真是精疲力竭
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

381
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,900
你感觉如何  伊丽莎白
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

382
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,130
要我说吗
You know what?

383
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,540
我是有点累
I am a little tired.

384
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,100
能行行好帮我拿杯咖啡吗
Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?

385
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,640
当然
Sure.

386
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,940
要清咖啡吧
Black, right?

387
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,080
其实我现在更想喝火辣甜蜜的印度咖啡
Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.

388
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,150
马上就来
Coming right up.

389
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,440
你来干嘛
What?

390
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,410
你什么意思  今晚是光晕之夜
What do you mean "what?" it's halo night.

391
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,010
我不能玩  病得厉害
I can't. I'm too sick.

392
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,240
快走
Go away.

393
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,750
所以我们才转战到你家
That's why we moved halo night here.

394
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,380
看  我还带了我妈做的鸡汤
Look, I brought my mom's chicken soup.

395
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,510
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

396
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,820
别赶他走嘛
Don't send him away.

397
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,320
-让他进来  -那是谁
- Let him in. - Who's that?

398
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,520
我买了只鹦鹉
I bought a parrot.

399
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,990
得了吧
Yeah, right.

400
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,960
普林顿博士
Dr. Plimpton?

401
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,500
嗨  你是霍华德吧
Hi. Howard, right?

402
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,160
我是
Uh, yeah.

403
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,170
能问你个问题吗  霍华德
Can I ask you a question, howard?

404
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,470
你喜欢角色扮演游戏吗
Do you like role-playing games?

405
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,100
当然
Yeah, sure.

406
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,210
其实我是个地下城主
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

407
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,480
今晚可以换种口味
Not tonight.

408
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,550
今晚你就当个送外卖的
Tonight you are a delivery man.

409
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,910
送来了鸡汤
You brought soup,

410
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,520
但不幸的是拉杰和我却没钱付给你
But uh-oh, Raj and I don't have enough money to pay you.

411
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,090
所以我们只能搞一些特殊交易
So we'll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.

412
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,460
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

413
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,230
你们自己商量下细节
You two figure out the details,

414
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,730
我去换下装
I'm going to go change into something

415
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,930
等着你们一把撕掉
I don't mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
我靠  真的假的
What the frak?

417
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,710
你快走
Go away.

418
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,470
她喜欢印度风的  不是什么犹太风
She wants new delhi, not kosher deli.

419
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,880
再说你都有女友了
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

420
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,510
都分手几星期了
We broke up weeks ago.

421
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,510
怎么都不见你提过
Why didn't you say anything?

422
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,980
我在等待最佳时机
I was waiting for the right time.

423
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,380
现在时机就正好
This is the right time.

424
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,120
准备好光晕大战了吗
Hey, who's ready for halo?

425
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,590
我靠  又来个人添乱
Oh, this is like a nightmare.

426
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,890
快滚
Get lost!

427
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,230
没错  人数已经够多了
He's right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.

428
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,690
我没听懂
I don't understand.

429
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,560
哇哦  赞  莱纳德来了
Oh, good.Leonard's here.

430
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,130
赞
Good?!

431
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,630
伊丽莎白 怎么回事
Elizabeth? What's going on?

432
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,970
现在你和霍华德是我的搬运工
What's going on is you and Howard are my moving men

433
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,640
而拉杰是我的新房东
And Raj is my new landlord

434
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
可我却没钱付给你们
And I don't have enough money to pay any of you.

435
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,780
她的意思和我想的一样淫荡吗
Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?

436
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,710
对
Yep.

437
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,420
欢迎来到淫荡世界[原义为一本色情杂志]
Welcome to the penthouse forum.

438
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,450
举手表决  有谁同意
Okay, show of hands. Who's up for this?

439
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,860
我们仨都得赤裸裸坦诚相对的
We'll all be naked in front of each other.

440
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,590
那我不干
I'm out.

441
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,230
大家准备好了吗
Everybody ready?

442
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,800
按我说的做
Follow my lead.

443
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
就快了
Almost.

444
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,770
我们准备到走廊上去
We're, we're going to go out into the hallway and,

445
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,140
来个戏剧性登场
make a dramatic entrance.

446
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,940
太好了  这种效果更好
Oh, good. It's so much better when everyone commits.

447
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,910
快走快走  别回头看
Run. Run, run, run. Don't look back.

448
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,110
我还以为能有些特别的呢
I thought we had something special.

449
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,580
这么说  你付不出房租咯
So, you say you can't pay your rent...

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,030
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard?

451
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,870
我在脱水机里发现的
I found these in the dryer.

452
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,200
应该是谢尔顿的吧
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.

453
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,670
多谢
Thanks.

454
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,740
童装要买到这样的尺码真不容易
It's really hard to find these in his size.

455
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,080
听着
So, listen.

456
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,010
关于那天早上的事  我一直想找你谈谈
I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.

457
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,120
你是指你和淫荡骚女博士的事吗
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

458
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
我想向你解释
Yeah, I wanted to explain.

459
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,420
你不必向我解释
Well, you don't owe me an explanation.

460
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,460
-是吗  -对啊
- I don't?  - No, you don't.

461
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,560
这么说  你不会有想法咯
So, you are not judging me.

462
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,450
我当然有想法
I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday.

463
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,300
但你不必向我解释
But you don't own me an explanation.

464
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,350
不管怎样  我还是要解释一下
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one on the record,

465
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,000
让你明白  我为什么要这么做
so you can understand why I did what I did.

466
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,780
我听着呢
I'm listening.

467
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,290
她自己送上门的
She let me.
