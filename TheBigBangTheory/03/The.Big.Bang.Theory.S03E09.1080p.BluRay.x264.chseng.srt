1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,130
两年之后  突然有人敲门了
So two years later, there's a knock on the door.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,300
那人打开门  看见门口立着只蜗牛
Guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360
蜗牛说  "这TM是怎么回事?"
who says, "What the heck was all that about?"

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,660
我不知道笑点在哪儿
I don't really get it.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,000
你看  蜗牛花了两年的时间才...
Well, see, it took two years for the snail to...

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,300
那不重要
Not important.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
-我能问你个问题吗  -当然
- Can I ask you a question?  - Sure.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,860
你认为我们会发展到什么程度
Where do you think this is going?

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,260
老实说  我本来希望至少上个二垒
To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,260
你真风趣
You're so funny.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,700
你就像是个单口相声演员
You're like a stand-up comedian.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,730
一个犹太单口相声演员  这很新鲜
A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,760
事实上  我觉得他们当中很多都是犹太人
Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,800
不  我只是  算了
No, I was just... Never mind.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,630
霍华德  这是我们的第三次约会
Look, Howard, this is our third date

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,660
我们都知道这意味着什么
and we both know what that means.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,630
-都知道吗  -性
- We do?  - Sex.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,800
你开玩笑的吧
You're kidding.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,500
但我需要知道你是要谈
But I need to know whether you're looking

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,360
一场恋爱还是要一夜情
for a relationship or a one-night stand.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,200
好的  只是搞清楚点
Okay, just to be clear:

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
这个问题只有一个正确答案吗
there's only one correct answer, right?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
而不是飞机选餐里的要"鸡肉还是鱼肉"
It's not like "chicken or fish" on an airplane?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,230
也许你需要认真思考一下这个问题了
Maybe you need to think about it a little.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,360
也不是没有过
You know, it's not unheard of

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,500
从一夜情发展为恋爱关系的事
for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,830
等你想明白了再给我打电话
Call me when you figure it out.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,630
三次约会意味着性
Three dates means sex?

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,760
谁知道啊
Who knew?

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,230
向你致敬  宅男
Greetings, homies.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,460
宅女
Homette.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,000
为什么这么早就结束约会回来了
Why are you back from your date so early?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
谈恋爱  就要跟在娱乐业一样
In romance, as in show business,

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,330
总是要让观众欲求不满
always leave them wanting more.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,030
这到底是什么意思
What exactly does that mean?

36
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,060
他被三振出局了
He struck out.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,810
生活大爆炸第三季第九集

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,760
你们两个知道
Hey, did either of you guys know

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
与同一个女人约会三次
that three dates with the same woman

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,300
就可以上床的临界点?
is the threshold for sex?

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,400
事实上  我从未与同一女人约会三次
Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,930
而我和佩妮花了两年
With Penny and me, it took two years.

43
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,800
现在认真回想一下  的确是三次约会
Now that I think about it, that was three dates.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
好吧  那在你和佩妮搞上之前
Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up,

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,060
她有没有要求什么承诺
Did she ask for any kind of commitment?

46
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,200
没  她倒是非常清楚地表示
No, she was pretty clear about

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
要有保持随时换人的权力
wanting to keep her options open.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,330
我有东西要宣布一下
I have something to announce,

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,800
但是出于惯例  我会等你们
but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
说完现在的话题
to finish your current conversation.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
你们在聊什么呢
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,460
一种文化模式
The cultural paradigm in which people have sex

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,760
就是人们会在三次约会后做爱
after three dates.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,100
原来如此
I see.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
现在我们是说的"date"是指社交活动
Now, are we talking "date," the social interaction,

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,760
还是指干枣
or "date," the dried fruit?

57
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,530
算了  你要宣布什么
Never mind, what's your announcement?

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,000
很好  轮到我了  这令人非常兴奋
Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,060
并且我想让你们最先知道
and I wanted you to be among the first to know...

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,200
嗨  库珀
Hey, Cooper.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
我听说你下周要和《科学星期五》的
I hear you're going to be on the radio

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,230
艾拉·弗雷托上广播节目
with Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,860
谢谢  克瑞普克  剥夺了我跟我的朋友
Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity

64
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,100
分享这则新闻的机会
to share my news with my friends.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,030
很荣幸
My pleasure.

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,860
我的"谢谢"可不是诚恳的
My "thank you" was not sincere.

67
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,300
但我的"很荣幸"是的
But "my pleasure" is.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,350
让我问你个问题
Let me ask you a question:

69
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,330
什么时候国家公共广播
At what point did National Public Radio

70
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,260
不得不邀请一些废材
have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel

71
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,930
作为嘉宾呢
for its guests?

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,760
别回答  这是个比喻
Don't answer. It's rhetorical.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,900
为什么你是个笨蛋
Why are you such a stupid head?

74
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,630
这也是个比喻
That is also rhetorical.

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,500
真抱歉你们不得不听到这些
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
你真的要上国家公共广播吗
Are you really going to be on NPR?

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,530
没错  他们通过我办公室的电话采访我
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office,

78
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,560
问一些最近所谓的"发现"
regarding the recent so-called "discovery"

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,930
关于自旋冰中的磁单极子
of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices.

80
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,700
因为是誓言周  他们想通过一些辩论
It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,460
来提高收听率
with a little controversy.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,900
真酷  恭喜你
Very cool, congratulations.

83
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,130
谢谢  我妈妈也非常兴奋
Thank you. My mother is very excited.

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,030
她召集了她的圣经学习小组来收听
She's convening her Bible study group to listen in,

85
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,500
然后为我的灵魂祈祷
and then pray for my soul.

86
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,830
我曾经上过一次电台
I was on the radio once.

87
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,130
我打进了新德里的狂热FM104的热线
I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi

88
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,560
成为了第四个说一句话就能拿钱的人
and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays:

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,260
"狂热104   aajke naye  acchha sangeetka ghar."
"Fever 104, aajke naye  acchha sangeetka ghar."

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,700
意思是  "狂热104
That means: "Fever 104,

91
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,230
超棒流行音乐之家
home of the really good current music."

92
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
还是在印度语里说更拉风
It's much catchier in Hindi.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,200
好的  这些是明天上国家公共广播
All right. These are the talking points

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,830
访谈的讲点
for my NPR interview tomorrow.

95
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,830
我必须确定它们对于那些
I need to make sure that they're simple enough

96
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,060
教育程度较低的听众来说也足够简单易懂
for the less educated in the audience to understand.

97
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,700
霍华德  看一遍然后告诉我你哪里不懂
Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.

98
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,300
劳驾  我有麻省理工大学的
Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,400
工程硕士学位证书
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,100
要求修完144个学分
It required the completion of 144 units of grad work

101
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,530
和一篇原创论文
and an original thesis.

102
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,130
没错
Yes.

103
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,660
看完告诉我有哪些不清楚的
Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
谢尔顿让你做事
You know, when Sheldon gives you homework,

105
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,260
你可以拒绝
you don't have to do it.

106
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,960
其实你拒绝更好
In fact, it's better if you don't,

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,200
不然搞得我们几个很尴尬
otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
-各位好  -你好
- Hi, guys. - Hey. Hello.

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
拉杰  跟我说话
Yo, Raj, talk to me.

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,330
抱歉  耍你而已
I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,630
霍华德  你干嘛不打电话给伯纳黛特
Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,130
她说什么了吗
Did she say something?

113
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,830
她说你一个星期没跟她联系了
Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week.

114
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,030
我以为你喜欢她呢
I thought you liked her?

115
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,430
是喜欢  但她要我给个承诺
I do, but she wants a commitment

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,830
我又不确定她是不是我喜欢的类型
and I'm not sure she's my type.

117
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,460
她都愿意免费跟你约会
She agreed to go out with you for free.

118
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,130
你还想怎么样
What more do you need?

119
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,530
伯纳黛特是很好
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

120
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,800
我只是一直觉得  当我想认真的对待感情时
I just always thought when I finally settle down

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,960
对方应该是一个
into a relationship, it would be with someone,

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,730
你知道  一个特别的人
you know, different.

123
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,230
怎么特别
Different how?

124
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,430
更像《变形金刚》里的梅根·福克斯啦
Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers.

125
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
或者《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》里的
Or Katee Sackhoff

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,430
凯蒂·萨克霍夫啦
from Battlestar Galactica.

127
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,830
你嗑药啦
Are you high?

128
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,400
你跟《宇宙威龙》里有三个咪咪的
You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted

129
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
火星妓女在一起的可能性更大点
Martian hooker from Total Recall.

130
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,830
你说的太不实际了
Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.

131
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,360
那部电影都差不多20年了
Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,030
想想那些咪咪该下垂成什么样了
Imagine how saggy those thing would be.

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,500
霍华德  你想守着你的荒诞幻想不放
Howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,160
而放过像伯纳黛特这么好的女生吗
because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?

135
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,100
你的感情定下来了不代表我也要这样吧
Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.

136
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,930
喂  我在这坐着呢
Excuse me, I'm sitting here.

137
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,000
我又没有和莱纳德定下来
Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,200
他显然不像我通常约会的类型
I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with...

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,600
体格上不像
you know, physically.

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,900
再说一次  我在呢
Again, I'm right here.

141
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,000
我的意思是  我不会以封面断定书的好坏
My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
我更在意人的内心
I am interested in the person underneath.

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,060
我在这吧  你看得见我
I am here, right? You see me.

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,430
我也在意人的内心啊
Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too,

145
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,660
但是希望内心外面包装点像
but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in,

146
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,330
哈莉·贝瑞（肤色黑）的巧克力不对吗
say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?

147
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,760
对  你也是巧克力装
Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,360
行  我告诉为什么不对
All right, you know what, I will tell you

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
抱歉  我能插下话吗
why it's wrong... Excuse me, may I interject?

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
干嘛
What?

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
从生物学角度上说
Biologically speaking,

152
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,900
霍华德想找最佳伴侣繁殖后代
Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate

153
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,560
完全合情合理
for the propagation of his genetic line.

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,760
-谢谢  谢尔顿  -不过
- Thank you, Sheldon. - Now, whether that

155
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,930
但这种繁殖如果站在人类进化的角度来看
propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course,

156
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,760
又是完全不同的问题
an entirely different question.

157
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,300
我是艾拉·弗莱托
This is Ira Flatow and you're listening

158
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,230
您正在收听的是公共广播电台的周五科学
to NPR's Science Friday.

159
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,700
今晚跟我们电话连线的是
Joining us today by phone

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
在加州帕萨迪纳办公室里的
from his office in Pasadena, California

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,230
谢尔顿·库珀博士
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

162
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,960
这个肯定很好玩
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

163
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,500
欢迎参加我们的节目  库珀博士
Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

164
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,160
我很荣幸  艾拉
My pleasure, Ira.

165
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,130
我们讨论一下磁单极子吧
Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles.

166
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,160
你能给听众解释一下什么是磁单极子吗
Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,330
当然可以
Of course.

168
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,730
首先  一块普通的磁铁
First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,

169
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,360
即使教育程度再低的听众
as even the most uneducated

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,130
都应该知道  有两个磁极
in your audience must know, two poles.

171
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,230
南极和北极
A north and south pole.

172
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,730
把磁铁切成两半  则变成较小的两块磁铁
If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets,

173
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,460
每块都有南北两极
each with its own north and south pole.

174
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,460
库珀博士  我们的连线
Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be

175
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,960
可能出了点问题
something wrong with our connection.

176
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,330
不  我听得很清楚
No, I hear you fine.

177
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,460
正如我刚刚说的  普通磁铁有两个磁极
As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles.

178
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,030
磁单极子的主要特征是
The primary characteristic of a monopole

179
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,600
它只有一个磁极  因此称为磁单极子
is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

180
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,230
弦理论  或者说M理论
A requirement for string theory,

181
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,160
的一个必要条件
or M-theory, if you will,

182
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,960
是存在磁单极子
is the existence of such monopoles.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,200
我本人曾带领一个考察队
I, myself, led an expedition

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,300
前往北极圈探寻这种粒子
to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles.

185
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,930
克瑞普克  我看到喷嘴了  你死定了
Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
真高兴你今晚能和我共浴
So nice you could join me this evening.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,800
你跟往常一样漂亮
You're looking lovely as always.

188
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,530
过奖  霍华德
Thanks, Howard.

189
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,330
一向乐意加入你的手淫幻想
Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.

190
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,660
别这样嘛  凯蒂
Come on, Katee.

191
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,360
何必说得这么低俗呢
Don't make it sound so cheap.

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
抱歉  在浴缸里自欺欺人
I'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub

193
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,660
确实是出类拔萃的行为
is a real class act.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,230
我们可以开始了吗
So, shall we get started?

196
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,200
当然
Sure.

197
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,060
但我能先问你个问题吗
But can I ask you a question first?

198
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,500
你想扮演赛昂人和殖民者吗
Do you want to play Cylon and colonist?

199
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,860
不
No.

200
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,700
我很奇怪  你明明可以和真人约会
I want to know why you're playing make-believe with me

201
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
却在这里和我玩性幻想游戏
when you could be out with a real woman tonight.

202
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,700
你是指伯纳黛特吗
You mean, Bernadette?

203
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
不  我是指莱娅公主(星战人物  路克·天行者的双胞胎妹妹)
No, I mean Princess Leia.

204
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,530
我当然指的是伯纳黛特
Of course I mean Bernadette.

205
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,700
她是个很好的女孩儿  真的喜欢你
She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.

206
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,500
我知道  但她不是你
I know, but she's not you.

207
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
我又不是真实的
I'm not me.

208
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,830
真正的我现正在比弗利山庄
The real me is in Beverly Hills

209
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,530
和某个英俊高大的有钱人约会呢
Going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.

210
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,800
真的吗  很高大吗
Really? Tall?

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,460
-一米九三呢  -哇哦
- Six-four. - Ouch.

212
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
问题在于  你遇到了一个好女孩
The point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life,

213
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,030
但却宁愿整晚在浴缸里对着虚拟影像
And you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights

214
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,230
和浴巾性幻想  也不去理她
in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,300
霍华德
Howard!

216
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,530
你到底在里面干嘛
What are you doing in there?

217
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,460
我在洗澡
I'm taking a bath!

218
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,530
你可别做啥其他猥琐的事
I hope that's all you're doing!

219
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,660
那浴缸我也要用
We share that tub!

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
别提醒我
Don't remind me!

221
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,560
老天
Oh, man.

222
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,300
都是泡泡  没有我子孙的容身之地了
All soaped up and no place to go.

223
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,430
哥们儿  你还好吧
How ya doin', buddy?

224
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,000
我在国家电台上被当众羞辱
I was humiliated on national radio.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,160
能好受才怪
How do you think I'm doing?

226
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,960
拜托  没这么夸张吧
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,700
你们来干嘛
What do you want?

228
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,860
(绿野仙踪中的麦琪肯人欢迎多萝西)
(munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild,

229
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,030
我们是棒棒糖团队  欢迎你的到来
and we want you.

230
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,800
好啊  克瑞普克捉弄了你一下
Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.

231
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,100
不好笑
It wasn't funny.

232
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,160
-我觉得很好笑  -拉杰
- I thought it was funny. - Raj.

233
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,500
你也笑了啊
You laughed.

234
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,330
你笑了吗
Did you laugh?

235
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,730
我笑得滚到地板上了
I fell on the floor.

236
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,700
好吧  这次是他赢了
All right, he got you.

237
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
你可以以牙还牙嘛
You can get him back.

238
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,330
我才不要堕落到他那种水准
I refuse to sink to his level.

239
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,500
你落不了  体内充满了氦气
You can't sink. With all that helium in you,

240
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,700
遇水不飘走就算你走运啦
you're lucky you don't float away.

241
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,830
你当真认栽了吗
Are you really admitting defeat?

242
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,300
我从不认栽
I never admit defeat.

243
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,460
很好
Good.

244
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,700
但是  从另一个方面讲
However, on an unrelated topic,

245
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,630
我再也抬不起头做人了
I am never getting out of this bed again.

246
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,730
那何不这样  你设法捉弄克瑞普克
What if you could make Kripke

247
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,630
让他看起来比你更蠢
look even sillier than he made you look?

248
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,800
我觉得这不可能  老兄
I don't think that's possible, dude.

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,230
你尽说些丧气话
You're not helping.

250
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,300
我本就不是来说好话  我是来吐糟的
I didn't come to help, I came to mock.

251
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,900
谢尔顿  你现在得好好想想
Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way

252
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,730
到底怎么报复克瑞普克
to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh,

253
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,200
好比蝙蝠侠把疯子罪犯小丑扔进了
like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him

254
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
亚克汗疯人院  事后他不是越狱了吗
in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

255
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
是啊  他不光是待在里面对其他
That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about

256
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300
精神病恶棍大吐苦水
His feelings with the other psychotic villains.

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,730
还越狱了  还对哥谭市的供水系统投毒
He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.

258
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
好吧
Well...

259
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,760
-那我该给克瑞普克下毒  -不
- I suppose I could poison Kripke. - No!

260
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,230
不  这其实很简单
No. It's a simple matter.

261
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,760
有那么几种有毒化学物
There are several toxic chemicals

262
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
尸检是查不出来的
that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.

263
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
你抓到了要领
Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

264
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,530
但手段可以温柔点
but, um, let's dial it back

265
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,660
不要置人于死地
to a non-lethal form of vengeance.

266
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,130
这样  在他的办公室椅子上弄个放屁垫
How about we whoopee cushion on his office chair?

267
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,500
他一坐下  听起来就像是有胃气胀
He'll sit down, it'll sound like

268
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,960
尽管他不是真有胃气胀
he's flatulent, even though he's not.

269
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,430
还是再想想吧
Let's keep thinking.

270
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,730
老兄  你可来晚了
Oh, gee, you're too late.

271
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,100
斯嘉丽·乔纳森和神奇女侠
Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here

272
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,960
刚在这里轮番歌颂神经质和胆小鬼呢
trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.

273
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,830
我来找伯纳黛特  她今天上班吗
I came to talk to Bernadette. She's working today, right?

274
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,330
是啊  但我觉得她不想见你
Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.

275
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,360
为啥
Why not?

276
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,060
得了  霍华德  你伤害了她
Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings

277
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,500
一个星期都不给人家电话
by not calling her all week.

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,900
加上我还说了你不少坏话
Plus, I've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya.

279
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,900
好啊  霍华德
Hello, Howard.

280
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,030
等下  伯纳黛特  我有话对你说
Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

281
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,160
现在不成  我在工作呢
I can't now, I'm working.

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,700
就一会儿
This will only take a second.

283
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,460
你之前让我好好考虑
You asked me to think about where

284
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,430
我们之间的关系  好吧我想过了
our relationship was going, and I did.

285
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,200
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?

286
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,500
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

287
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,530
我不明白  这算是玩笑吗
Is this more comedy that I don't understand?

288
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,500
不  我是认真的
No. I'm serious.

289
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
你是我生命中的唯一
I'm never going to find another girl like you

290
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,000
重要的是  你是真心喜欢我
who likes me and is, you know, real.

291
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,430
这不是开玩笑吗
So, this isn't a joke?

292
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,160
-不是  -那你铁定疯了
- No. - Then you're insane.

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,830
我觉得自己这是突施奇招
I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

294
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,200
霍华德  我们只约会了三次
Howard, we've only been on three dates.

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
甚至还没上过床
We haven't even had sex yet.

296
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
你说得对
Fair enough.

297
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,600
你什么时候下班
When's your break?

298
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,560
好事将成  你们嫉妒我了不是
Don't you just hate when this happens?

299
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,960
好了  用这个来复仇如何
All right, how's this for revenge?

300
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,430
一剂过氧化氢[双氧水]
A solution of hydrogen peroxide,

301
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,030
加上一剂饱和碘化钾
and one of saturated potassium iodide.

302
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,200
这又是什么
What's this?

303
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,400
山露汽水[碳酸饮料]
Mountain Dew.

304
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,660
啊  真是提神醒脑
Ahh, refreshing.

305
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,130
然后将这两样化学制剂  与普通洗碗剂结合
We're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap,

306
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,630
就会放热  释放出氧
creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
泡沫复仇记
Foamy vengeance.

308
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,730
完全正确
Yes, exactly.

309
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,900
谢尔顿  这招实在是高
This is brilliant, Sheldon.

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,930
但你怎么布置到克瑞普克的办公室
How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?

311
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,800
早就布置好了
Already taken care of.

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,060
注意看
Observe.

313
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,900
通过迷你摄像头拍摄到的克瑞普克实验室实况
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam

314
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,630
拜我偷塞到看门人衬衫口袋里的美钞所赐
I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill

315
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,930
我才能装了这个迷你摄像头
discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

316
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,300
与此同时
At the same time,

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,360
还将大量这样的化学制剂
I also secured large quantities of these chemicals

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,430
放到了他的天花板顶上
above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

319
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,060
哦  谢尔顿
Oh, Sheldon,

320
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,900
你让我想起年轻时的莱克斯·卢瑟[后成为超人的死敌]
you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.

321
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,060
您太过奖了  先生
You flatter me, sir.

322
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,300
-我猜猜  带运动感应器的  -是的
- Let me guess: motion sensors? - Yes.

323
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
一旦克瑞普克走到屋子中间
The reaction will be triggered

324
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,300
感应器就会触发
when Kripke reaches the center of the room.

325
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,500
木哈哈
Mwah, ha, ha.

326
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,800
我不得不承认  我很佩服你
I gotta say, I am really impressed.

327
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,660
这绝对是谢尔顿式的复仇方式
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.

328
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,200
这招或许技术含量不高
It may be low-tech,

329
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,930
但我还是坚持认为  放屁坐垫自有其喜剧效应
but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,130
克瑞普克来了
Here comes Kripke!

331
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,830
跟他一起的是谁
Who is that with him?

332
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,700
我想那是我们大学的校长
I believe that's the president of the university.

333
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,460
还有理事会成员  快中止  中止
And the board of directors.Abort! Abort!

334
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,630
没有中止程序
There is no "abort."

335
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,200
你怎么能不设中止程序
How could you not put in an "abort?"

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,600
我疏忽了  好了吧
I made a boo-boo, all right?

337
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,860
塞伯特校长  相信理事会将很欣慰地看到
I think the board will really appreciate

338
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,400
我们将国安局的拨款运用得如此之好
how well we're using that NSA grant, President Seibert.

339
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,660
这里是我们的微电脑控制的等离子...
Right here we have a micro-controlled plasma...

340
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,030
看上去就像洗衣日那天的恒河
Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.

341
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
至少他们不知道是你干的
At least they don't know it was you.

342
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,760
你好  克瑞普克
Hello, Kripke.

343
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,130
你此刻遭遇的经典恶作剧
This classic prank comes to you

344
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,030
来自恶意复仇的谢尔顿·库珀
from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper.

345
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,500
如果你想看看自己那张蠢蛋脸
If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face,

346
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,000
这段视频即刻就会上传到YouTube
this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube.

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,830
并感谢莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德和拉杰·库萨帕里
Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali

348
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,630
感谢他们在复仇大业中对我的支持与鼓励
for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.

349
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,360
我计划逃回印度去  你呢
Well, I'm going back to India.What's your plan?

350
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,330
给  7号桌给的小费
Hey, here's your tip from table seven.

351
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,660
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

352
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,200
麦克风测试  再次测试
Testing. Check.Check two.

353
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,930
这回又怎么了
Oh, now what?

354
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,660
想让我扔他出去吗
You want me to throw him out?

355
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,830
不用  没事的
No, that's okay.

356
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,300
你确定  他个子那么小
Are you sure? He's small.

357
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,830
我打赌我肯定能给他来个漂亮的背摔
I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.

358
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,160
这一曲  我想献给
I want to dedicate this number

359
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,030
一位被我伤害了的好姑娘
to a great gal who I've done wrong.

360
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,330
伯纳黛特[曲调来自The Four Tops乐队的《Bernadette》]
Bernadette

361
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,200
我感到非常抱歉

但那就是我的风格

366
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,300
我知道现在说爱还太早
* I know now it was too soon to talk of love

367
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,560
那只是我泡澡时突发的奇想
* It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub

368
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,530
但伯纳黛特  请再给我一次机会

找到浪漫的窍门  亲爱的伯纳黛特
* They call romance, Sweet Bernadette

372

373

霍华德·沃罗威茨
* Howard Wolowitz

376
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
伯纳黛特

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
-实在听不下去了  -你开什么玩笑
- Oh, I am so sorry. - Are you kidding?

378
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,000
那是别人为我所做的  最浪漫的事
That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,660
伯纳黛特  谢谢芝士蛋糕工厂
* Bernadette!  Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
