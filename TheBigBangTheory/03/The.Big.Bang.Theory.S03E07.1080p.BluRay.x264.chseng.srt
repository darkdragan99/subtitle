1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,190
哇  谢尔顿  真不敢相信你居然自创了游戏
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,390
"研究实验室"可不仅仅是游戏
Oh, "Research Lab" is more than a game.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,350
就像这标语写的  "物理虽然只存在于理论中
It's like the slogan says: "The physics is theoretical,

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,250
但其中的快乐却是实实在在的"
but the fun is real."

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,890
那我们现在肯定玩的不对
We must not be playing it right.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,420
好  五
All right, five.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,020
一  二  三  四  五
One, two, three, four, five.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,350
喔  看呐
Oh, wow, look at that.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,090
我的国防部科研资金再度下拨
My Department of Defense research grant is renewed.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,090
掷得好
Oh! Great roll!

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,050
现在你可以拆了你的苏式回旋加速器
Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,920
然后建造一个大型强子对撞机
and build the large Hadron Collider.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,920
吔
Yay.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,690
你玩这个很有天赋  佩妮
You're a natural at this, Penny.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,520
作为首批第二版测试者  你们会在周日
And as the first beta testers, you two'll have quite the edge

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,890
与沃罗威茨和库萨帕里的对决上获得不小优势
when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,850
天呐  谢尔顿
Oh, gee, Sheldon,

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,290
我不认为我们周日能来玩
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,150
为什么
Why not?

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,290
原因佩妮现在告诉你
Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,720
佩妮
Penny?

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,150
事实上  我要去机场接我的朋友贾斯汀
Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,620
听到了吧  她必须去机场接她的朋友贾斯汀
There you go-- she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport.

24
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,920
而且我玩不了因为我要和她一起去  对吗
And I can't play 'cause I'm going with her-- right?

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,250
对  如果你想的话
Um, yeah, if you want.

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,750
我是说  车子也许没有空间了
I mean, there may not be room.

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,450
他带了好多东西  比如吉他和放大器什么的
He's got a lot of stuff--like guitars and amplifiers...

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,650
等等
Wait.

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,350
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,550
我朋友贾斯汀
My friend Justin.

31
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,690
注意力集中点  莱纳德
Pay attention, Leonard.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,950
这是她周日不能来的原因
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,450
这个贾斯汀是谁
Who is this Justin?

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,190
-到你了  莱纳德  -我跟你提过他
- Your turn, Leonard.  - I told you about him.

35
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,820
-你没有  -掷骰子  莱纳德
- No, you didn't. - Roll the dice, Leonard.

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,220
有的  我一个来自奥马哈并玩吉他的朋友
Yeah-- my friend from Omaha; plays the guitar.

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
不论如何  他要来洛杉矶找些演奏的工作
Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work,

38
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,450
所以我跟他说可以在我家的沙发上睡几个星期
so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,490
快点  莱纳德  如果你掷了六
Come on, Leonard--if you roll a six,

40
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,690
佩妮就会在核外泄中惨死
Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,750
明白我为什么说乐趣是实实在在的了吗
See what I mean when I say the fun is real?

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,920
等等
Hang on.

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,150
某男要去睡你的沙发
Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?

44
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,490
他不是"某男"
He's not "some guy."

45
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,720
他是我朋友
He's my friend.

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,920
你说的"朋友"  是指"朋友般的朋友"
So by "friend," do you mean "friend friend,"

47
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,790
"同性恋朋友"还是
"gay friend," or "ex-boyfriend

48
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,050
"前男友兼现在你正柏拉图式暗恋
"who you're now platonic with

49
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
且有可能发生关系的朋友"
but still might have a thing for you friend"?

50
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,050
他肯定不是同性恋
Well, he's definitely not gay.

51
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,150
肯定不是同性恋的音乐人
Oh, ho-ho, a definitely not gay musician

52
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,120
睡在我女朋友的沙发上
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

53
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,120
真开心
Yippee.

54
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,220
好吧  我们很久之前是曾经拍拖过
Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago.

55
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,290
但绝对不是正在拍拖
But we were never like "going out."

56
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,550
不是为了表示我很有学问  但是上一次我查证
Okay, not to be pedantic, but last I checked

57
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,550
"曾经拍拖"实际上是"正在拍拖的"过去式
"went out" was in fact the past tense of "going out"--

58
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,190
并且地球人都知道这是"坦诚相见"的
which I think we all know is a popular euphemism

59
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,220
委婉说法
for "saw each other naked."

60
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,890
干脆我来替你掷好了
I'll just roll for you.

61
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,250
你对贾斯汀跟我住有意见吗
Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?

62
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,820
你当初是怎么想的
What was your first clue?

63
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,850
糟糕  工业事故
Uh-oh! Industrial accident.

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,750
告诉你  跟我说话的时候别把我当白痴
You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

65
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,220
我跟你说话时没把你当做白痴
I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot!

66
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,650
我是说这整件事很愚蠢
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!

67
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,890
"你一不小心直视氦氩激光
"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser.

68
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,590
暂停一轮并失去一只眼睛的视网膜"
Lose one turn and a retina."

69
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,720
难道你不是把我当白痴
How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot?

70
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,520
那是我的朋友  我的沙发
It's my friend, it's my couch,

71
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,520
是我TM自己的生活
and it's my freakin' life!

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,420
也到你掷骰子了
It's also your roll.

73
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,290
没错  那是你的生活
You know what? It is your life.

74
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,720
你要是想让什么狗屁吉他手睡你的沙发上  随你
If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine!

75
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,750
那你干嘛不租几张
Why don't you just rent

76
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,320
双层床然后把黑眼豆豆请来
some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!

77
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,950
听着  如果我想邀请整个洛拉帕罗扎音乐节的
Hey, if I want to invite the entire lineup of Lollapalooza

78
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,550
阵容来我公寓睡觉  我绝对会的
to sleep in my apartment, I will,

79
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,750
而且这与你无关
and it's none of your business!

80
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,850
你在听自己都说了些什么吗
Are you listening to yourself?

81
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,290
你知道你现在听起来是多么的小孩子气吗
Do you know how childish you sound right now?

82
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,420
哦  现在我变小孩子了
Oh, now I'm a child?

83
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,920
至少我再也不是白痴了
Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!

84
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,620
这两个词可不是互斥的
The two aren't mutually exclusive!

85
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,250
你真是个...
Oh, you are such a--

86
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,250
他这是TMD在干嘛呢
What the hell is he doing?!

87
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,490
他要把我们逼出去
He's drowning us out.

88
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,990
他不喜欢吵架
He doesn't like fighting.

89
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,950
谢尔顿  快停下来  吵架结束了
Sheldon, just stop! Look, the fight is over!

90
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,690
还有  仅供参考
Oh, and FYI,

91
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,490
你在遇到我之前根本就没听说过
you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas

92
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,450
黑眼豆豆
until you met me!

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
我听说过他们
I heard of 'em!

94
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,050
只不过不知道他们是个组合罢了
Didn't know they were a band.

95
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,220
谢尔顿  她已经走了
Sheldon, she's gone.

96
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,590
你可以关掉搅拌机了
You can turn off the blender.

97
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,720
你的恋爱关系已经到了一定要丑陋结束的地步吗
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?

98
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,420
不  我们只是有了点小争执
No, we just had a little spat.

99
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,090
往好的一面想想
Look on the bright side.

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,050
作为对佩妮的惩罚
As a result of Penny's forfeit

101
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,820
你成为了世界首位"研究实验室"的胜者
you have become the world's first winner of "Research Lab."

102
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,820
你要来份纪念沙冰吗
Would you like a commemorative snow cone?

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
生活大爆炸第三季第七集

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,800
我真不明白她怎么就这么直接宣布
I don't get how she can just announce

105
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,240
她的前男友要来睡她沙发上
that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
我想到了一个在车里能玩的游戏
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.

107
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,270
我不想玩游戏  谢尔顿
I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.

108
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,500
游戏名字叫"科学家"
It's called "Scientists."

109
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,540
现在  我会说出三个科学家的名字
Now, I will name three scientists,

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
然后你对他们排序
then you will put them in order

111
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,500
根据他们对各自领域的贡献大小
of the size of their contribution to their respective fields.

112
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,470
为了让这个游戏更有趣
To make this game even more compelling,

113
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,600
你必须只考虑这个人
you must consider only the contribution

114
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,870
对这个领域做出的贡献
of the man to the field,

115
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,140
不论这个领域的理论到底是对是错
not the validity of the field itself.

116
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,600
比如说阿布·穆萨·贾比尔·伊本·哈扬
For example: Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan

117
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,740
对臭名昭著的炼金术做出的贡献
made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
比霍伯特·范德普莱特在神经生物学中的贡献要大得多
than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology.

119
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,640
好了  准备好来点乐子了吗
Okay, ready to have some fun?

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,640
一个绝对不是同性恋的前男友
An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay.

121
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
还是人们最喜欢听的-- "绝对的"
That's what a guy likes to hear-- "definitely."

122
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,300
好的  我先来个简单的
All right, I'll start with an easy one:

123
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,870
艾萨克·牛顿  居里夫人和尼尔斯·玻尔
Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.

124
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,600
然后我只说了一点点最后却成了坏人
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!

125
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,870
提示  居里夫人有她的丈夫帮她
Hint: Madame Curie had her husband to help her.

126
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,370
我能说什么
What am I supposed to say?

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,770
当然  佩妮  你让旧相好在家过夜
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,200
我完全没意见
sleeping in your apartment."

129
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,370
莱纳德  你有没有意见不重要
"Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,940
因为本美女佩妮
"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty

131
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,540
喜欢干啥就干啥
and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

132
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
我懂了
"Oh, I get it!

133
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,040
你觉得和我在一起
"You think you're doing me a favor just by

134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
只是在同情我
being in a relationship with me!"

135
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,740
不  莱纳德  我能跟你同处一室
"No, no, Leonard! I'doing you a favor

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,200
就已经是同情你了
just by being in the same room as you!"

137
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,570
莱纳德  停车
Leonard! Stop the car!

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
怎么了
What?

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
我不想再听你们吵架了
I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
快  速度  要迟到了
Come on, come on, we're late.

141
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,100
淡定  我们能赶上电影
Calm down. We'll make the movie.

142
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,700
根据现在的情况  我的警告是对的
I believe my alarm is appropriate,given the situation.

143
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,540
电影17分钟后开始
The movie starts in 17 minutes,

144
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
也就是说我们得赶上科罗拉多大道的全部绿灯
which means we'll need to make all the lights

145
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,940
而且不能去买东西吃了
on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand,

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,300
开场前也不能去尿尿了
and preshow urination.

147
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,240
兄台  我刚灌下一瓶红牛时
Oh, dude, I wish you had said something

148
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,840
你咋不说话
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,940
走  恐龙战队  快
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!

150
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,500
嘿
Hey.

151
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,140
嘿
Hey.

152
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,770
我们赶着去看电影
We're, uh, going to the movies.

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,970
才怪
No, we're not.

154
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,040
我们站在走廊里
We're standing in the hallway,

155
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,770
忍受你们尴尬的相遇
suffering through an awkward encounter.

156
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,700
等一下
Hang on.

157
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,200
新的《时光大盗》今天开映
They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits.

158
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,600
你不会想看的  对吧
You wouldn't want to come, would you?

159
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,200
一点都不想
Not really, no.

160
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
好了  毫无意义的邀请说了
All right, invitation pointlessly offered,

161
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,470
不出意料地被谢绝了
invitation declined as expected,

162
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,600
大家都很文明  没有人吵架
everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.

163
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,670
晚上愉快
Have a nice evening.

164
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,940
就给我们一分钟
Just give us a minute.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,970
你们慢慢谈
Oh, take all the time you need.

166
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,870
我们要不要谈谈昨晚的事
So, are we going to talk about last night?

167
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,200
你准备道歉了吗
Are you ready to apologize?

168
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
不
No.

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,100
答案错误
Wrong answer.

170
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,100
谢谢参与
But thank you for playing.

171
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,070
拜托
Oh, come on.

172
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,240
这也太傻逼了
This is stupid.

173
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,270
又来了
Oh, there it is again!

174
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
你觉得我很傻逼
You think I'm stupid!

175
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,470
不  人傻和行为愚蠢
No, there's a difference

176
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,170
是不一样的
between being stupid and acting stupid.

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,370
是吗  那混球和混蛋
Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference

178
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
也很不一样呢
between being a jerk and being an ass!

179
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,470
才怪
No, there isn't!

180
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,700
两个是同义词
They're synonyms!

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,170
场面相当不愉快啊
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

182
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,170
开场前我都不用尿尿了
Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.

183
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,900
莱纳德  那女的三年前搬进来时
Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago,

184
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
我就告诉你不要搭理她  现在好了
I told you not to talk to her, and now look,

185
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,940
电影我们是迟到定了
we're going to be late for the movies.

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,300
哟  《神奇蜘蛛侠》183
Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.

187
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,400
买了
Got it.

188
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,470
记得这本吗
Remember this one?

189
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,800
蜘蛛侠之一败涂地
Spider-Man loses a big fight

190
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,300
接着女朋友还跟他分手了
and then his girl friend breaks up with him.

191
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,330
要我买给你吗
Want me to get it for you?

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,200
能帮你转移一下注意力
It'll help take your mind off things.

193
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,870
伙计们  怎么回事
Hey, guys. What's going on?

194
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,530
等下一场《时光大盗》放映前
Oh, we need to kill a couple hours

195
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,430
我们得在这消磨几小时
till the next showing of Time Bandits.

196
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,330
没问题
Oh, well,no problem.

197
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,100
我还想早点打烊回家
I was thinking of closing early and going home,

198
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,570
但面对现实吧
but let's face it,

199
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,370
我家也只不过是间小一点的
that's just a slightly smaller lonely room

200
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,300
堆满漫画书的孤舍
filled with comic book

201
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,000
谢谢  斯图尔特
Thanks, Stuart.

202
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,300
我问你
Let me ask you something.

203
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,770
你觉得佩妮让老相好
Do you think it's okay for Penny

204
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,570
在自己家过夜合适吗
to have an ex-boyfrid sleep on her couch?

205
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,270
当然不好  她明显太过分了
No, I mean, she's obviousl way out of line.

206
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,270
谢谢
Thank you!

207
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,630
但如果她把你甩了
But if she dumps you,

208
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,170
她第二天就能找个新欢
she'll have a new boyfrien by tomorrow morning

209
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,330
而你得想办法自己做一个娃娃
and you'll have a new girl friend

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,330
才能算有新欢
when you figure out how to build one.

211
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,370
唯一的疑问是  你什么时候才举白旗
So the only question is: how long until you fold?

212
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,170
我才不会举白旗
I am not going to fold.

213
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,530
等等  我不觉得
Well, excuse me, I don't think

214
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,830
佩妮有丝毫过分之处
Penny's out of line at all.

215
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,230
她又不是你的人
You don't own her.

216
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,030
正如我的女神碧昂斯说的
It's like my girl Beyonce says:

217
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,570
你要是喜欢塔  就该向他求婚
"If you like it, you should put a ring on it."

218
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,800
得了吧
Come on.

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,000
最起码
At the very least,

220
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,330
佩妮发现莱纳德为此不高兴
when she found out Leonard was upset about it,

221
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,070
她就应该退让
she should've backed off.

222
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,330
你是说正如某人不高兴
You mean like when a guy's upset

223
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
因为他朋友答应和他去上烹饪课
because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him

224
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,200
结果却放鸽子
and then doesn't show up

225
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,700
因为他正和他妈进行果蔬汁断食
because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?

226
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,970
我不知道你为此不高兴
I didn't know you were upset about that.

227
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,300
是嘛  难道所有的暗示你都没看到
Really! Did you miss all the subtitle indicators,

228
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,300
比如"霍华德  我不高兴"
like me saying, "Howard, I am upset."

229
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,570
对不起  行了吧
Okay, sorry.

230
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,970
或许在这个国家的意义不同
Maybe it means something different in this country.

231
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,930
在印度  这表示我在生一个叫霍华德的小子的气
Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,030
我道过歉了
I said I'm sorry.

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
道歉也弥补不了
Sorry doesn't make up for the fact

234
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,330
我得和一个素食者做鸡肉饭
that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy.

235
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,330
你知道素鸡肉饭是什么吗
Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is?

236
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,370
就是米饭
Rice!

237
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,330
你以为我就很开心吗
Yeah, well, you think I was having fun,

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
整晚坐着听我妈唠叨
sitting around all night listening to my mother say,

239
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,600
你这辈子尿过这么多吗
"Have you ever peed so much in your life?"

240
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,530
天啊  你真是个恋娘狂
Oh, my God, you are such a mama's boy.

241
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,270
喂  别把我妈扯进来
Hey, don't bring my mother into this!

242
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,730
你自己把她扯进来的
You brought your mother into this!

243
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,230
别吵了  你们两个
Stop it, both of you.

244
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,970
听你们吵个不停
All this fighting, I might as well

245
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,930
简直就跟我爸妈一样  "该死的乔治"
be back with my parents! "Damn it, George,

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
"我说过你要是再不戒酒我就离开你"
"I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"

247
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,030
"这只能说明你是个骗子"
"Well, I guess that makes you a liar.

248
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,830
"我已经醉成这样  你还没走"
"'Cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here!"

249
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,000
"别嚷了"
"Stop yelling!"

250
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,630
"谢尔顿快被你弄哭了"
"You're making Sheldon cry!"

251
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,430
"告诉你谢尔顿为什么哭吧"
"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry!

252
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,270
"因为我让你给他起了这个破名儿"
That I let you name him Sheldon"

253
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,000
老天  他干嘛这么生气
Boy, what got him so upset?

254
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,000
当然了  谢尔顿生气你倒能看出来了
Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon's upset.

255
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,530
多谢惠顾
Oh, thank you very much.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,970
欢迎下次光临
Come back soon.

257
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,630
还有下次多给一半小费
With the other half of my tip.

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

259
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,660
你怎么在这儿
What are you doing here?

260
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,830
这是家餐馆
This is a restaurant.

261
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
而现在午餐时间
It's lunchtime.

262
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,630
我认为  作为一名女招待
I would think, as a waitress,

263
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,730
应该很熟悉这套程序了
you'd be familiar withhe paradigm.

264
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,900
莱纳德来吗
Is Leonard coming?

265
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,860
不来  我相信他正在等着你
No, I believe Leonard is waiting

266
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,560
回心转意  并向他道歉呢
for yo to come crawling back to him and apologize.

267
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,800
这绝不可能
Well, that's not gonna happen.

268
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,300
我猜也是
I assumed that would be your attitude.

269
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,830
所以我才因此到这儿来
Hence, my true purpose coming here.

270
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,230
-啥  -我要你回心转意去向他道歉
- Which is? - I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.

271
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,230
我忙呢
I'm busy.

272
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,200
不好意思  小姐
Excuse me, Miss.

273
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,630
我想要点餐
I'like to order lunch.

274
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,160
说  你要啥
Fine. What do you want?

275
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,760
我有些疑问
I have a few questions.

276
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,760
我先是注意到你们这有汤和半份三明治
First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?

277
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,160
没错
Yes.

278
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,560
半份三明治到底是怎么做的
Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from?

279
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,830
你是给我另一个人吃剩下的呢
Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich,

280
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,330
还是我非要等到
or do I have to wait

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,630
另一个想点的人出现
for someone else in the restaurant

282
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,860
再和他一起合点呢
to order the other half?

283
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,130
不  谢尔顿  他们只是做出来而已
No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.

284
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
你没法做出半份三明治
You can't make a half-sandwich.

285
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,960
如果是整个三明治的一半
If it's t half of a whole sandwich,

286
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,560
那应该是个小号三明治
it's just a small sandwich.

287
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,860
得了  汤和小号三明治
Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich.

288
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,230
你要点这些吗
that what you want?

289
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,360
当然不  我还是老样子
Of course not. I'll have my usual.

290
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,630
好
Great.

291
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,200
你不问我是否要饮料了吗
Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?

292
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,230
你不是一直都喝柠檬汁吗
Don't you usually get lemonade?

293
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,600
-是  -你要柠檬汁吗
- Yes. - Do you want lemonade?

294
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
-是  -还需要什么吗
- Yes. - Anything else?

295
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,800
当然  我要你去向莱纳德道歉
Yes-- I want you to apologize to Leonard.

296
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,160
我绝不会去道歉
I am not going to apologize.

297
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,260
我又没错
I've done nothing wrong.

298
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,460
完全是他反应过度
He is completely overreacting.

299
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,530
这无关紧要
Irrelevant.

300
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
关键在于你们出了感情问题
The disruption in your relaonship

301
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,260
让我也难以忍受
is making my life intolerable.

302
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,160
抱歉  谢尔顿  但这真的与你无关
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.

303
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,030
我不懂
I don't follow.

304
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
我马上来
ah, yeah, I'll be right there.

305
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
听着  谢尔顿  我得走了
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

306
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,230
好吧  那我假设  当然是谬误论证
All right, let's assume, ad argumentum,

307
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,000
在这情况下  是莱纳德错了
that in this case, Leonard is wrong.

308
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,530
就是他的错
Leonard is wrong.

309
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
考虑到以前他对你的出轨行为
Considering the number of transgressions

310
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,800
视而不见的次数
you've committed that he's overlooked,

311
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,230
你就不能考虑下  就这次
Don't you think that, just this once,

312
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,260
算是回报他吗
you could return the favor?

313
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,300
我就来
I'm coming.

314
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,460
再见  谢尔顿
Good-bye, Sheldon.

315
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,030
什么叫我的出轨行为  啥意思
What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?

316
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,330
你还以为莱纳德
Were you under the impression

317
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,330
对你都毫无怨念吗
that Leonard has no complaints about you?

318
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,930
啥  喂那边的  我看到你了
Like what?! Yeah, yeah, I see you.

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,860
你对着空气划了一个勾
You're making a little check sign in the air.

320
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,460
知道了  耐心点别吵
I got it. Just hold you horses.

321
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,700
莱纳德抱怨我什么
What does Leonard complain about?

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,160
你驾驶技术差劲
Your driving.

323
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
你床上的布绒玩偶太多了
The plethora of stuffed animals on your bed

324
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,560
两人亲热的时候一直盯着他
that stare at him during your amorous activities.

325
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,330
你老是迟到  还有你的唱歌水平
Your constant tardiness, your singing.

326
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,300
我唱歌的水平
My singing?

327
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,760
这其实是我的看法之一
That's actually from my list.

328
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,600
但莱纳德会不同意我才怪呢
But Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.

329
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,400
如果莱纳德对我有这么多意见
Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me,

330
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,630
他干嘛不直接了当地说出来
Why hasn't he just said so?

331
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,600
因为在他看来
Because, according to him

332
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,230
你脾气大又容易动怒
you're oversensitive and have a temper.

333
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,330
是吗
Oh, really?

334
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,730
那拜托你帮个忙
Well, then, do me a favor

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,130
告诉莱纳德  他好去死了
and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!

336
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,730
难怪她总是小费拿得少
And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped.

337
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
好啊  你回来了
Oh, good, you're home.

338
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
我要你帮我个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

339
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,730
说吧
Sure.

340
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,900
去向佩妮道歉
Go apologize to Penny.

341
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,330
-啥  -最好现在就去
- What?! - Right now would be good.

342
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,900
莱纳德
Leonard!

343
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,260
好吧  其实应该更早一点去
Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.

344
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,700
听说你不喜欢我床上的布绒玩偶
I hear you don't like

345
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,030
我的驾驶技术和我的准时程度
My stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.

346
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,260
啥  谁告诉你的
What? Who would tell you something like that?

347
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,660
你干嘛告诉她
Why would you tell her something like that?

348
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,400
他为什么告诉我不重要
It doesn't matter why he told me.

349
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
但这些都是真的  是吗
It's true, isn't it?

350
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,600
没错  是真的
Okay, yeah, it's true,

351
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,140
但这些我都可以忍受
but I can live with that stuff.

352
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,640
但我不能忍受你事先不和我商量
What I can't live with is you casually informing me

353
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
只是随意地知会我一声说
that some guy's going to be staying your apartment

354
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,970
有个男人要住在你公寓里
wiout even asking me first!

355
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,200
问题不在于此
That isn't your problem!

356
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,000
而在于你不信任我
Your problem is you don't trust me!

357
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,170
得了吧
Oh, come on.

358
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,830
谢尔顿  你啥时有听我说过
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say

359
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,500
我不信任佩妮了
that I don't trust Penny?

360
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,570
谢尔顿  他去哪儿了
Sheldon? Where did he go?

361
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,770
你大吼大叫
Oh, your yelling

362
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,140
一定又把他吓跑了
Must have freaked him out again.

363
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,240
你去哪儿
Where are you going?!

364
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,370
我们吵到一半
You just walk away

365
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,700
-你就这么一走了之吗  -才不是
- In the middle of aargument?! - No.

366
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,070
我要去找你那天杀的室友
I'm going to go find your damn roommate

367
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,200
免得他做出伤害自己的傻事
before he hurts himself

368
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
例如乱穿马路之类的
trying to cross the street something!

369
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,470
你干嘛不早说
Why didn't you say so?

370
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,800
连这也要得到你允许吗
Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!

371
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,540
我怎么知道你在想啥  佩妮
Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!

372
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,700
真的吗  怎么会呢
Really? Why not?

373
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,340
反正你这么聪明  而我又这么蠢
You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!

374
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,300
拉杰
Raj?

375
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,470
拉杰
Raj?

376
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,800
拉杰
Raj?

377
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
别敲了  门开着
Stop knocking! It's open!

378
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,370
请告诉我父母  我的暗物质研究
Please tell my parents that our Dark Matter research

379
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,640
正在节骨眼上  我不能回家
Is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home

380
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,840
去参加我表弟桑杰的婚礼
For my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

381
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,870
谢尔顿
Sheldon

382
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,440
问问我们儿子  我们要怎么跟切尔迪夫妇交待
Ask our son what we're supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry

383
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,270
他们的女儿拉克希米可是特地从伦敦飞回
Whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London,

384
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,390
唯一的目的  就是跟他见面相亲
For the sole purpose of meeting him.

385
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,140
我又没让你们撮合我和拉克希米
I didn't ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.

386
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
你该感谢我们
You should be thanking us!

387
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,470
是的  拉克希米才刚切去了部分胃
Yes.Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled.

388
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,970
你有机会趁她减完肥  找回自尊之前
You have an opportunity to get in good with her

389
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,100
赶紧跟她搞好关系
Before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.

390
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,540
我不在乎
I don't care!

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,100
为嘛你们就不信我能自己找到另一半
And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?

392
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,070
因为你都27了
Because you're 27

393
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
你身边看着最像我们儿媳妇的
And the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law

394
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
就是那个犹太男孩霍华德
Is that Jewish boy Howard.

395
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,670
你们这是恶意中伤
Oh..that is completely below the belt.

396
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,500
谢尔顿  来告诉我父母  我和霍华德只是朋友
Sheldon,tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends.

397
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,500
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

398
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,740
我和霍华德只是朋友
Howard and I are just friends!

399
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,940
好吧  我会回家出席桑杰的婚礼
Fine. I'll come home for Sanjay's wedding.

400
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,140
谢尔顿
Sheldon?!

401
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,700
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

402
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,940
他又不是走失的小狗
He's not a lost dog.

403
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,200
干嘛不干脆让我来找他
Hey, why don't you just let me find him

404
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,570
你就坐这儿踩着你那想象中的刹车
While you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?

405
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,340
那刹车或许是我想象出来的
The brake might be imaginary,

406
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,500
但你刚刚闯的那个红灯不是
But that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

407
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,700
哪个红灯
What stop sign?

408
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,600
看前面  看前面
Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!

409
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,600
霍华德  去应门  我在忙
Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!

410
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,270
我也在忙  你去应门
I'm busy, too! You answer it.

411
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,900
我不能  我在上厕所
I can't! I'm on the toilet!

412
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,740
天哪  这种事就别告诉我了
For God's sake, I don't need to hear that!

413
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,170
你就不能就说一句"我在忙"吗
Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?

414
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,640
我说了  但你不是还不满意吗
I said I'm busy,but that was't good enough for you!

415
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,870
我真希望是有人来入室抢劫
You know what?I hope it's one of those home invasion deals,

416
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,570
然后照我头上  给我一枪痛快
And they shoot me in the head!

417
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,240
如果真是入室抢劫的
Well, if it's a home invader,

418
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,670
别告诉他们我在上厕所
Don't tell them I'm on the toilet!

419
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,770
根本就没人
There's no one there.

420
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,270
你幻听了吗  你个疯老婆子
You're hearing things, you crazy old lady!

421
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,240
斯图尔特  见到谢尔顿了吗
Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?

422
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,100
对  他就在那边漫画角
Yeah, he's, uh, over in the graphic novel section.

423
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,800
给自己造了个小窝
Built himself a little nest.

424
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,640
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,070
-佩妮  -有事吗
- Uh, Penny?  - Yeah?

426
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,470
你们没事吧
Is everything okay?

427
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,470
你指什么
What do you mean?

428
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,070
谢尔顿告诉我  你跟莱纳德吵架了
Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?

429
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,100
对  差不多吧
Oh, yeah, kind of.

430
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,300
没什么大事
It's-It's no big thing.

431
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,470
很好  很好
Oh, good, good.

432
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,500
我爱你
I love you.

433
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,700
你不跟我讲话  我是不会走的
I'm not leaving until you talk to me.

434
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,940
怎么回事
All right, what's going on?

435
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,470
这有点难解释  他这么做
It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing

436
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,340
是假装他处于一个异次元中
Where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension

437
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,940
虽然跟我们在同一物理空间
That occupies the same physical space we're in,

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,970
但无法感知我们
But he can't perceive us.

439
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,470
你少臭美了  我懒得理你而已
Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.

440
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,470
拜托  谢尔顿  回家吧
Come on, Sheldon, let's go home.

441
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,240
看  我们俩已经不吵了
Look, we're done fighting.

442
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,470
这话我听多了
I've heard that before.

443
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,270
但然后呢  接下来
But then, the next thing you know,

444
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,940
我躲在自己卧室  大声读着费曼(著名物理学家)的讲义
I'm hiding in my bedroom,blaring a Richard Feynman lecture

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,470
而我妈  则在吼叫着说她即使在我爸的烘肉卷里
While my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her

446
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,800
放上玻璃渣  上帝也会原谅她的
If she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf.

447
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,640
还有我爸  站在屋顶上
And my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting

448
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,440
用我妈的富兰克林珍藏版碗碟  玩双向飞碟射击
Her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

449
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,600
我们不会再吵嘴
There's going to no more shouting

450
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,670
也不会有人玩双向飞碟了
And no skeet-shooting.

451
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,840
真的
Really?

452
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,770
那你朋友贾斯汀要睡哪儿
Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?

453
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,440
对啊  他要睡哪儿
Yeah... where's he gonna sleep?

454
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,200
我的天  你们就不能忘了这茬吗
Oh, my God, would you let this go?!

455
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,270
要是我就会
I'd let it go.

456
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,470
干嘛要我忘了这茬
Why should I let it go?

457
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,870
干嘛不去跟那人说  让他另外找地儿借宿
Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?!

458
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,500
上帝啊
Oh, for God's sakes.

459
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,240
我知道  你有童年阴影
So, you have childhood issues.

460
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,270
我们都有童年阴影
We all have childhood issues.

461
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
有时候  你能做的就是长大成熟  克服他们
At some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.

462
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
开火  开火
Fire! Fire!

463
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,200
莱纳德  让我来处理  好吗
Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please?

464
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
-再次开火  开火  -先把这...
- Again! Fire! Fire! - Let... just...Look...

465
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,570
谢尔顿  请你理解我们
Sheldon, please, try and understand.

466
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,870
我和莱纳德是在谈恋爱
Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship,

467
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,670
偶尔  我们俩是会吵架
And occasionally, we're going to fight.

468
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,200
但不管我们俩之间怎么样
But no matter what happens between us,

469
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,700
我们会一直爱你到底
We will always love you.

470
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
对吗  莱纳德
Right, Leonard?

471
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,500
一直  是段漫长的时光
Always is a long time.

472
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,400
当然  一直
Sure. Always.

473
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,700
我们给你买这个机器人好吗
You know, how about we buy you this robot,

474
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,070
然后我们就一起回家
And then we all go home?

475
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,540
我想要那个
I want that one.

476
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
好  就给你买那个
Okay, you can have that one.

477
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,170
拜托  他就只会玩个两次
Oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice,

478
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
然后就跟其他那些垃圾一起束之高阁了
And then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.

479
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,640
莱纳德  给他买这个机器人
Buy him the robot, Leonard.

480
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,470
还能给我买这本漫画吗
Can I get this comic book, too?

481
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,800
宝贝  都给你买
Yes, you can.

482
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
又见面了
Meet me again.

483
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,600
你告诉贾斯汀不能借宿在你沙发上时
So what did Justin say when you told him

484
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,040
他怎么说
He couldn't sleep on your couch?

485
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,270
他是个音乐人
He'a musician.

486
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,870
不得已的话  叫他睡自个儿的呕吐物里都成
He's sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.

487
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,850
我真该叫他们买更多的
I should have asked for much more

488
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,000
不该被一本漫画一个机器人就打发了
Than a comic book and a robot.
