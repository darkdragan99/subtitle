1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,190
看咱哥俩  准备好去奔赴四人有约
Look at us, getting ready for a double date

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,150
并且她们以名副其实的女朋友身份
With actual women who publicly acknowledge

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,180
光明正大的来约会
They're our girlfriends.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,380
没错  真女人最赞
Yes, actual women are the best.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,930
我就不明白了
I don't understand.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,910
难道还有其他种类的女人
What other kind of women are there?

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,620
霍华德  人造女性是属于你的研究部门的
Howard, artificial women are your department.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,750
你要接这个茬吗
You want to take this?

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,480
才不咧  那会吓坏他的
No, it would just freak him out.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,230
听着  在出发之前
Listen, before we leave,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,280
我要警告你  我是个热情的男人
I should warn you, I'm a passionate man

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,680
倾向于公开地表达我炙热的感情
And I tend towards public displays of affection.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,580
你到底想说什么啊  霍华德
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,660
我会在车里或餐厅里缠绵一下
There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant,

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,560
而且我不想让伯纳黛特感到不安
And I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,210
所以如果你和佩妮也打啵儿的话会有所帮助的
So it would help if you and Penny made out, too.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,010
别担心
Don't worry.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,330
我们正打算在沙拉吧上云雨一番咧
We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,850
晚上好  白种人
Namaste, white people.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,730
好消息
Good news!

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,930
我租到了四小时特别版的《守望者》
I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,830
-我有了  -看过了
- Got it.  - Seen it.

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,300
我的详细分析已经发到网上了
Detailed analysis posted online.

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,880
那...我们今晚干嘛
Well, then what are we going to do tonight?

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,110
不好意思哈  拉杰
Uh, sorry, Raj.

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,180
我和霍华德要与
Howard and I are going out to dinner

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,610
-佩妮和伯纳黛特共进晚餐  -没错
- With penny and bernadette.  - Yeah.

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,480
我和莱纳德告别无忧无虑的单身生活了
No more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,520
咱这两匹野马算是彻底从良了
These broncos have been saddled.

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,530
我们是怎么勾到真正的女人的
How did we get actual women?

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,950
真棒
Great.

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,940
难道他们就这么见色忘义
They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,430
这很好哇  不是吗
It is great, isn't it?

34
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,060
-一个美妙的夜晚就在前方  -是吗
- We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.  - We do?

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,210
那是  我才发现我没有
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,540
足够的硬盘空间分配给Linux系统
Enough room ony hard drive for a Linux partition,

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,930
所以你和我要做一份全套备份
So you and I are going to perform a full backup,

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,880
初始化然后重装我的所有操作系统
Reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,210
我才不想做那个咧
I don't want to do that.

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,080
好吧
All right.

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,940
那我要做一份全套备份
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,690
初始化然后重装我的所有操作系统
Reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.

43
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,260
那我呢
What about me

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,890
嗯...我刚了解到有好几种类型的人造女性
Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,340
也许你应该关注一下那方面
Maybe you should look into that.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
生活大爆炸第三季第十二集

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,830
老兄  今晚有太多很酷的事情
Dude, there's so many cool things

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,910
等着我们去玩呢  看
We could be doing tonight. Look.

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,620
在幽谷拱廊商场
At the glendale galleria,

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,470
"穿上你最正的阻特装
"Put on your best zoot suit
（40年代流行爵士音乐迷所穿上衣过膝  宽肩  裤子肥大裤口狭窄的服装）

51
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,420
在梅西百货附近的中央广场向摇摆音乐致敬
"It's a salute to swing music in the center court near macy's.

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,670
晚五点到九点
5 p.M. To 9 p.M."

53
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,800
怎么样  如何
Huh? Huh?

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,510
向阻特装的致敬
A salute to zoot.

55
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,130
听起来像是猫头鹰
Sounds like a hoot.

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,210
不好意思  拉杰
I'm sorry, Raj,

57
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,470
我今晚没有向任何类型服装致敬的欲望
I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight.

58
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,640
更何况这还涉及到四十年代的种族暴乱
Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
种族暴乱
Race riots?

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,980
阻特装暴动
The zoot suit riots.

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,290
啊哈
Oh.

62
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,570
我一直以为那是什么圣诞节后的减价活动
I always thought that was some sort of after-christmas sale.

63
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,480
那为什么不单纯地到拱廊商场散散步呢
Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,330
我又不需要那里面的东西
But I don't need anything at the galleria.

65
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,830
你在拱廊商场有何需求
Do you need anything at the galleria?

66
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,300
没  我们就随便走走看看怎么回事而已
No. We would just walk around and see what's what.

67
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,480
这在语义上是个无效的句子
That's a semantically null sentence.

68
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,980
那好吧  嗯...那这个如何
Okay, well, how about this?

69
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,470
大学网站上的
From the university web site:

70
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,890
晚七点到十点  诺顿厅多功能室
7 p.M To 10:00 p.M., Norton hall multipurpose room,

71
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,160
"理科与文科的
"Mixer for grad student and faculty

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,810
研究生和教员联谊
of the science and humanities departments.

73
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,360
"不论你是分解原子还是分解不定式
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,130
这是你必到的聚会
This is the place to be."

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,820
这当然是很幽默 但...
Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

76
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,420
但我没兴趣
I have no interest.

77
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,740
别这样  谢尔顿
Come on, Sheldon,

78
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,110
这个世界上充满了在室外活动的人
The world is filled with people doing things outside.

79
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,200
我们出去吧
Let's go outside.

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,270
外面多美好
Outside is good.

81
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,670
要是外面这么美好  那为什么人类花费上千年
Outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years

82
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,470
来完美内部装饰
Trying to perfect inside?

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,290
我咋知道  也许是营销计划
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme.

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,780
拜托  谢尔顿  我是个年轻的
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
来自他乡的"刚健的"纯爷们儿访客
Virile visitor from a foreign land

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,160
我需要炫耀下我的"宝贝"
And I need to strut my stuff.

87
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,490
那我提供个妥协方案
Let me offer you a compromise.

88
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,350
当我感到憋闷  想换换视野的时候
Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery,

89
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,670
我会利用我的想象力
I use my imagination.

90
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,280
天  来了
Oh, boy.

91
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
我最爱探访的地方之一
One of my favorite places

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,960
就是二维世界
To visit is the two dimensional world

93
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,730
在爱德温·艾伯特的数学幻想小说
Described in Edwin Abbott's mathematal fantasy,

94
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,100
《平地》里有描述过
"Flatland."

95
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,510
我才不想去平地
I don't want to go to flatland.

96
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,710
你这么说只是因为你还没去过那里
You're only saying that becae you haven't been there.

97
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,090
我现在是二维空间里的一个六边形
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

98
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,020
并且只能感知其他物体的边缘
And can only perceive the edges of other objects.

99
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,230
见鬼咧
Oy.

100
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,280
那是你吗  拉杰
Is that you, Raj?

101
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,150
我认不出你的边缘
I don't recognize your edge.

102
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,910
谢尔顿  我求你了
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

103
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,960
我想参加这个联谊  而且不想一个人去
I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,660
那你就走运了
Well, you're in luck.

105
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,760
在平地上正有一个联谊
There's a mixer here in flatland

106
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,920
看啊  那边有条性感的线段
Oh, look, the's a sexually attractive line segment
（在埃德温的小说里线段是女性）

107
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,050
你应该跟她搭讪
You should chat her up.

108
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,610
-什么?  -告诉她你是一个圆
- What?  - Tell her you're a circle.

109
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,910
平地上的女孩子都喜欢圆
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

110
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,430
伯纳黛特  我希望你现在有胃口
I hope you're hungry, beadette.

111
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,170
我们要去一家很棒的餐厅
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

112
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,830
噢  我快饿死了
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

113
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,430
花了一整天的时间在生物实验室
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,

114
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,340
观察食肉细菌如何吃掉小型啮齿类动物
Watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents,

115
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,290
真的让人胃口大开
It really works up an appetite.

116
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,430
这个女人喜欢食肉细菌
Flesh-eating bacteria.

117
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,240
但我还是想吻她
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman.

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,530
这说明什么?
What does that tell you?

119
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,230
为了上她二垒这个极小的可能性
That you'd be willing to die a horrible death

120
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,620
你愿意尸骨无存地死去?
On the off-chance you'd get to second base?

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,610
我们已经远不止是二垒的关系了
Oh, we're way past second base.

122
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,080
对吧  亲爱的?
Right, Howard?

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
虽然我们对各垒的位置
Well, we kind of disagree

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,750
有些分歧
About what the bases are.

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,830
佩妮  你工作怎么样?
How's your work going, penny?

126
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,210
有参加什么表演吗?
Any acting jobs?

127
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,450
我最近的一个大型表演是
Well, the last big thing I did was this production

128
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,020
在一家保龄球馆上的剧场演出安妮日记
Of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.

129
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,550
但我觉得我的转机马上要来了
But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.

130
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,690
太好了  怎么回事?
Great. How come?

131
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,840
答应我你不会嘲笑我
Well, promise you won't make fun of me.

132
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,440
当然  我永远不会嘲笑你
Of course, I would never make fun of you.

133
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,610
好吧
Okay.

134
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,520
一个通灵师告诉我  如果我剪了头发
Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair,

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,890
我就能出演一个全国性的广告
I'm going to get a national commercial.

136
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,130
什...  开玩笑呢吧?
Wh... seriously?

137
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,120
你去找通灵师要职业建议?
You're getting career advice from a psychic?

138
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,490
好一个永远不嘲笑她
Good job not making fun of her.

139
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,710
她跟那些骗子不同的  好不好
She's not one of those phonies, okay.

140
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,660
她写了本书  还有自己的网站
She wrote a book and has her own web site.

141
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,080
噢  你干吗不早说?
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,020
又不是人人都有资格申请网站的
They don't let just anyone have a web site.

143
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,390
-你干吗这么刻薄?  -你觉得奇怪?
- Why are you being such a jerk?  - You're surprised?

144
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,960
你的通灵师没告诉你我会变得很刻薄?
Your psychic tell you I was going to be a jerk?

145
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,670
去死吧
Bite me.

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,920
开玩笑嘛  佩妮
Come on, penny.

147
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,620
你们俩继续吵你们
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

148
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,810
我们要在后面亲热一会儿
We're gonna make out back here.

149
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,810
我要上你三垒了
I'm sliding into third.

150
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,130
谢谢你陪我来
Thanks for coming with me.

151

Thanks for giving me

限量版的绿灯侠能量灯
Your limited edition green lantern lantern.

153
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,280
你非得带上它不可吗?
Did you really have to bring it in with you?

154
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,540
如果恶魔来袭  但我的戒指又没了能量怎么办?
What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?

155
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,220
-来吧  我们去喝一杯  -我不喝酒
- Come on, let's get a drink.  - I don't drink.

156
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,100
我要喝酒
Yeah, well I do.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,450
而且我的泡妞伙伴带着台能量灯
And when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern,

158
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,110
我得喝得更多
I drink a lot.

159
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,230
请给我一杯伏特加橙汁鸡尾酒
I'll have a screwdriver, please.

160
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,050
别吝啬你的伏特加
Don't be chintzy with the screw.

161
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,140
我要一杯漂浮沙士 [无酒精饮料]
I would like a root beer float.

162
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,390
谢尔顿  他们这儿没有冰淇淋
Sheldon, they don' have ice cream.

163
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,160
没有?
They don't?

164
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,130
显然这里的人对派对的定义
Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly

165
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,910
跟我是不一样的
On the definition of "Party."

166
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,450
给他秀兰·邓波尔（一种无酒精鸡尾酒）
He'll have a shirley temple.

167
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,400
也别吝啬里面的果汁
And don't be chintzy with the shirley.

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,510
好的
Okay,

169
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,420
我们开始找女人吧
Let's check out the females.

170
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,490
好
All right.

171
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,870
那里有个女人
There's a female.

172
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,080
那是威尔金森教授的太太
That's professor wilkinson's wife.

173
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,010
她好像都80了
She's like 80 years old.

174
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,220
但她是个女人
But she's female.

175
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,960
-你不是要玩找女人的游戏吗?  -不
- Isn't that the game?  - No.

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,310
我要找的是能共赴巫山的小妞
I'm looking for a hookup.

177
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,100
噢  是么
Oh, yes.

178
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,600
所以这个游戏的重点是
So, the point of this exercise is

179
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,870
帮你找到可以交配的人?
For you to find someone to copulate with?

180
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,730
别那么大声
Not so loud,

181
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,580
不过理论上是正确的
But ideally, yes.

182
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,850
谢谢
Thanks.

183
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,800
谢谢你
Thank you.

我作为泡妞伙伴的职责是什么?
And what is my function as "Wingman"?

185
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,850
-帮我完成游戏  -没问题
- You help me run my game.  - Okay.

186
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,850
你的游戏是什么?
What is your game?

187
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,690
在我跟女人胡吹的时候
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,

188
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,790
你就点头附和我
You nod and agree.

189
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,330
这玩意儿真帅
Hey, that's pretty cool.

You're very funny.

195
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,860
我是艾比
I'm Abby.

-我是谢尔顿  -你好

神秘的印度次大陆
The mysterious subcontinent of India.

201

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,020
哇  那我就是贫民窟的天体物理学家
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

204
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,410
你爸不是妇科医生吗[有钱人家]
I thought your father was a gynecologist.

205
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,830
抱歉
I'm sorry.

206
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,890
玛莎  快来

209
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,090
-你好  -你好
- Hello.  - Hello.

210
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,730
这不是限量版的
Is that the limited edition

211
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,880
绿灯侠能量灯吗
Green Lantern Lantern?

212
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,490
光明的昼  暗黑的夜
"In brightest day, in darkest night,

213
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,800
一切罪恶无所遁形
no evil shall escape my sight."

214
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,090
真是酷毙了
Oh, that is so awesome!

215
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,640
多谢
Thank you.

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,040
选好要和谁交配了吗
Have you chosen one to copulate with?

217
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,830
我们聊些什么呢
So, what should we talk about?

218
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,750
我们可以再听听某人的言论
Well, we could always learn more

219
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,260
为什么信灵媒的人都是小白
about why people who believe in psychics are idiots.

220
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,580
是吧  莱纳德
Leonard?

221
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,990
这我们就不必多说了
Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore.

222
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,570
莱纳德在车里已经说得够绝了
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.

223
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,870
不好意思  但事实如此
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

224
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,600
得了  你所无法理解的事
Right, and if you can't understand it,

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
那就不是事实
It's not a fact.

226
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,260
不  如果不是事实  那就是扯淡
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

227
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,310
明白了
Oh, got it.

228
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,490
多谢你教育我
Thank you for educating me.

229
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,670
不客气
You're welcome.

230
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,920
鱼好吃吗
How's your fish?

231
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,830
相当美味
Amazing.

232
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,190
要来点吗
Would you like to try some?

233
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,030
-当然  -但事实很残酷
- Yeah, sure.  - Well, the fact is,

234
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,290
偏不给你吃
you can't.

235
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,220
霍华德  伯纳黛特  你俩都是科学家
Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you' both scientists.

236
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,000
行行好  帮帮忙吧
Help me out here.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,930
你觉得呢  他们小两口矛盾
What do you think-- want to jump

238
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,430
我们要搅这趟浑水吗
right in the middle of another couple's argument?

239
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,470
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

240
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,670
爱莫能助
Sorry.

241
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,850
我想我们别谈这个话题了
Maybe we suld just stop talking about this.

242
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,860
我还是觉得我们都闭嘴好了
Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.

243
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,280
今晚用餐如何
How is everything tonight?

244
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,190
相当郁闷
Really uncomfortable.

245
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,390
稳定而互相支持的一夫一妻关系中
You know, the best thing about being in a committed,

246
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,350
最大的优点就在于
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

247
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,300
即使两人发生分歧
is that even if you have different idea,

248
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,890
并经过激烈辩论  但感情不受影响
you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for,

249
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,460
甚至吵过后还是可以云雨一番...
even make love with...

250
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,420
不要鱼了吗
Want your fish?

251
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,700
我不用是灵媒
I knew you were going to do that.

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,040
也能猜到你会这样
Doesn't make me psychic!

253
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,700
好吧  你这废柴只会把事情越弄越糟
Attaboy, Leonard make it worse.

254
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
什么情况
What's going on?

255
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,680
我们找到女人了
We scored.

256
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,230
我助攻的
I'm the wingman.

257
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,280
好啊
Hey.

258
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,200
-戴上  防镭射  -难忘一宵啊
- Laser.  - Had a great night last night.

259
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,790
我是不想透露太多啦
I don't like to kiss and tell,

260
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,980
但某些人已经上了八垒了哦
but somebody made it to eighth base.

261
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,620
八垒是个什么情况
What the hell is eighth base?

262
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,810
七垒只到宽衣解带
Seventh base with shirt off.

263
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,970
宽的还是我的衣
Well, my shirt.

264
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,350
你和佩妮咋样了
How'd things go with Penny?

265
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,430
好得不能再好了
Oh... couldn't be better.

266
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,010
我们感情生活一不顺
Are we taking our relationship

267
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,500
就拿无辜的赛昂人出气吗
frustrations out on innocent Cylons?

268
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,950
可不止赛昂人呢
It's not just Cylons.

269
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,690
接下来就轮到超人了
Superman's next.

270
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,630
好吧  我本想在吃午饭前
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

271
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,320
溜过来吐吐槽
a little more mocking before lunch,

272
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,140
但我想我还是识相点撤吧
but I can come back later

273
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,320
免得被你的杀伤性武器给殃及了
when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

274
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,660
我怎么能和信灵媒的女孩子约会呢
How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?

275
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,730
这有啥  我以前泡过一个妞
Hey, I once dated a girl

276
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,170
她还相信自己被外星人绑架过
who believed she was abducted by aliens.

277
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,560
你就不介意吗
And that didn'bother you?

278
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
正相反[法语]
Au contraire.

279
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,430
说明她好骗又值得"深探"一番
It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.

280
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,240
我该咋办
What am I supposed to,

281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,070
和佩妮一起时我就得装着相信吗
Pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny?

282
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,000
我肯定佩妮和你一起时
Yes, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,870
她也不都是装出来的吗
when she's with you.

284
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,730
帮个忙  怎么都好  让我爆了你
Do me a favor-- lean or, put your head right here.

285
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,400
换种说法和你解释吧
Let me show you anothe way to look at this.

286
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,320
这里是全宇宙的女人
Here we have the universe of all women.

287
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,680
其中这一部分的女人
These are the ones

288
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,940
你想和她们上床
you want to sleep with.

289
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,080
而这里的女人则与你的想法如出一辙
These are the women who believe exactly what you believe.

290
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,960
而只有这点女人愿意和你上床
These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you.

291
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,750
而你的理想伴侣
And right there in the little triple intersection...

292
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,360
只能从这三者之间小小的交集中找了
is your ideal mate.

293
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,980
而你的那个她可能是个又矮又自卑的物理学家
Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem

294
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,060
还是在为中国政府研究所工作
who lives in a government research facility in china.

295
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,710
你到底想说啥
What's your point?

296
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,160
为了和佩妮继续交往下去
In order to keep hing a sexual relationship with Penny,

297
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
我就得放弃
I have to give up everything I believe in--

298
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,610
我对科学知识的信仰
my intellectual integrity, the very nature

299
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,540
和我的本性吗
of who I am?

300
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,430
我做不到  霍华德
I can't do that, Howard.

301
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,190
完全理解
I respect that.

302
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,240
那是什么
What is that?

303
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
你的新女友
Your new girlfriend.

304
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,760
祝你今晚愉快
Have fun tonight.

313
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,410
什么意思
What was that?

314
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,880
是指"请进"
It means "Come in."

315
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,160
我电脑在装新的操作系统
It's taking forever to load

316
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,250
等的时间太久了
The new operating system on my computer.

317
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,330
我消毒了厨房和卫生间
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

318
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,660
索性就来学习芬兰语吧
And now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

319
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,110
那是印度语
That's Hindi for

320
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,990
就是说你爱咋咋滴吧
"Whatever floats your bought."

321
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,190
我收到艾比发来的短信
Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby,

322
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,650
她跟她朋友玛莎  还想跟我们出去玩
And she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again.

323
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,010
你怎么说
What do you say?

324
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,330
我什么都不会说
I don't say anything.

325
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,120
只会提醒你  你这个表情
I merely offer you facial expression

326
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,290
说明你走火入魔了
That suggests you've gone insane

327
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,230
我不明白  你明明也很开心的啊
I don't get it.You had a great time.

328
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,350
没错  我是玩得很开心
Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

329
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,400
但完了就完了  我就找其他事做了
That's done; I've moved on to other things.

330
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,020
比如说  等我学会了芬兰语
For example, after I learn Finnish,

331
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,100
我是不会再去学一遍的
I'm not going to learn Finnish again

332
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,950
求你了  谢尔顿  我这个无助的印度男孩
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

333
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,080
远离故土  就想交个女朋友
Far from home, and I want a girlfriend

334
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
想让艾比当我女朋友
And I want her to be Abby,

335
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,760
但除非能带上玛莎  不然她是不会出来的
And she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.

336
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,870
拉杰  我强烈怀疑你能提出什么论据
Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make,

337
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,430
或许你可以试试威胁我  运用夸张策略
Threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

338
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,170
恳求我  给我施法
Plea, invocation,

339
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,700
跟我祈祷  芬兰语是vetoomus
Supplication, or... vetoomus

340
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,950
不如试试这几招  说服我再考虑下
That you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.

天哪
Oh, my.

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,800
这是我多年梦寐以求的
I've admired these for years.

344
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,450
也就是说你肯再次跟我出去见她们了
So does that mean we can go with the girls again?

345
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,350
绿巨人同意再次跟弱小的人类约会
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

346
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,340
约会时你可不能戴那手套
You can't wear the hands on the date.

347

Hulk sad.

348
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,740
你清理干净了烘干机滤出来的绒毛
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

349
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,410
不但是种礼貌之举
Not only is it courteous,

350
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,100
更增加了安全系数
It's safety smart.

哇  真是个有趣的事实
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

你可是在我们四人约会的时候
After you were the most obnoxious person

359
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,730
做足了讨人嫌的事  尤其是还当着霍华德·沃罗威茨的面
On a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?

360
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,540
不  我很抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

我说真的
I really am.

你愿意看看这本书吗
Would you be willing to read a book

好吧  我们去见见你的灵媒
Okay, let's go see your psychic.

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,500
对  我们俩至少得有一人保持开放的思维吧
Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.

372
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,660
你是说我没有开放的思维
You saying I don't have an open mind?

Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.

378
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,450
真的吗  界限在这里吗
Really, that's the line?

物理是真实的  水晶就是种巫术
Psychics are real,but crystals are voodoo

380

巫术也是真实存在的

我还从未如此考虑过

385
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,880
这必将彻底
Wow, that's going to

我在想  能不能到你房里呆一会
I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.

396
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,570
我想可以吧
Well, I suppose.

397
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,190
进来吧
