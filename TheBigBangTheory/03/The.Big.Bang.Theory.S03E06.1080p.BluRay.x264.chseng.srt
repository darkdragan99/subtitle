1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,590
风筝嗬
Kites, ho!

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,650
风筝嗬
Kites, ho!

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,190
不好意思
Excuse me.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,950
你们误用了"嗬"这个词
You're misusing the word "ho."

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,320
这是用于引起目标注意的感叹词
It's an interjection used to call attention

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,480
而不是物体  例如"停下嗬"
to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, "Land, ho!"

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,390
或者"向西嗬"
Or, uh, "Westward, ho!"

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,220
风筝嗬
Kites, ho!

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,020
各位好  在忙什么
Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,050
出去发现电的存在吗
Going out to discover electricity?

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,350
如果你说的是本杰明·富兰克林的成果
If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,290
他没有"发现电的存在"
he did not "discover electricity,"

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,520
他只是利用风筝证明
he merely used a kite to determine

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,220
闪电"带"电
that lightning "consists" of electricity.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,950
他还发明了富兰克林壁炉式取暖炉
He also invented the Franklin stove,

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,290
双光眼镜和灵活导尿管
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,250
风筝嗬
Kites, ho.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,690
我们准备去斗风筝
We're heading out for some kite fighting.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,420
-斗风筝  -对
- "Kite fighting"?  - Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,220
一项极具竞争性和激烈性的运动
It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,650
其实  割到喉咙的风险很低
Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,430
另外  严重被线擦伤才是真实
On the other hand, severe string burn is a real

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,090
且经常发生的危险
and ever-present danger.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,730
你想来观战吗
You want to come watch?

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,290
天啊
Oh, gee...

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,750
听着很不错
Sounds amazing.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,620
不过  我有些朋友会过来
But, um, I've got some friends coming over.

28
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,150
没什么大事
Not a big thing-- we're just

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,700
只是聚在一起看内布拉斯加比赛
gonna watch the Nebraska game.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,250
橄榄球  行
Oh. Football, sure.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,290
猜得好
Good guess.

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,350
我本想叫上你  但我知道你不是球迷
I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,490
对  当然  很好
No, no, I'm not, so... great.

34
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,770
你能做自己喜欢的事
You've got plans

35
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,860
我也能做自己喜欢的事
doing something you like, I've got plans

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,660
这样很好
doing something I like, so it's good.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,950
我们能迟些再聚
Well, maybe we'll hang out later--

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,270
等大家都走了
you know, after everybody's gone.

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,160
行  可以
Yeah, great.

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,050
再见
See ya.

41
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,280
太逊了
Well, this sucks.

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,550
抱歉  我觉得无聊  开小差了
I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off.

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,590
什么东西很逊
Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?

44
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,840
莱纳德刚发现佩妮不想带他见朋友
Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,650
因为莱纳德是个身材矮小
from her friends because he's a tiny, little man

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,930
又喜欢放风筝的人
who flies kites.

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,700
这当然会很逊
Oh, that certainly would suck.

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,900
生活大爆炸第三季第六集

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,830
沃罗威茨想侧翼包围咱们
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,630
你放线  飞高点
Let out some string, add altitude

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,230
我从下方偷袭割他的线
and I'll go under and cut his line.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,970
为什么佩妮不想让她朋友认识我
Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,500
集中精神比赛  莱纳德
Focus, Leonard, focus!

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,900
战斗的热浪迎面而来
The heat of battle is upon us.

55
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,530
战争的恶犬已被释放
The dogs of war are unleashed.

56
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,930
或许库萨帕里说得对
Maybe Koothrappali's right.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
也许我让她囧了
Maybe I embarrass her.

58
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,230
你现在就让我囧了
You're embarrassing me right now.

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,330
一个大男人在放风筝的时候
A grown man worrying about such nonsense

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,970
居然担心这种无聊东西
when in the middle of flying kites.

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
对不起
Sorry.

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,220
道歉可打不下对方的风筝
Sorry won't bring their kites down.

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,570
被线擦伤  痛痛
String burn! String burn!

64
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,000
他们以为我们想侧翼包围
Oh, they think we're flanking.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,210
正中我们下怀
They're playing right into our hands.

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,970
我数到三  使出绝杀飞剪
On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor.

67
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,610
一  二
One, two...

68
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,470
哇
Whoa!

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,460
-看到没  -什么
- Did you see that? - See what?

70
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,230
那个小妞  她冲我笑
That chick-- she smiled at me.

71
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,810
-没有  -有
- No, she didn't. - Yes, she did.

72
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,150
快  飞剪  飞剪
Come on, scissors, scissors!

73
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,780
-帮我拿着  -等等
- Hold my line. - Wait.

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,000
你去干什么
What are you doing?

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
我没法单独使出飞剪
I can't scissors by myself!

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,840
霍华德  回来
Howard! Come back!

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,920
胜利
Victory!

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,540
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,130
你真是垃圾朋友  知道吗
You're a sucky friend, you know that?

80
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,400
比垃圾还垃圾的朋友
A sucky, sucky friend.

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,000
我能怎样
What was supposed to do?

82
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,670
她冲我那么诱惑一笑
She gave me that "come-hither" look.

83
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,830
就算她冲你笑  那也是笑你很逊
If she gave you any look at all. it was a "you suck" look.

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,130
如果没有拉伤大腿  我就能追上她
I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,870
拜托  你才80磅重
Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds.

86
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,200
哪有什么大腿肌肉
You don't have a hammy.

87
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,100
佩妮不想带我见朋友
So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends.

88
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,870
我让她囧了  有其他可能吗
I embarrass her. What else could it be?

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,890
她的行为
Well, her actions

90
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,800
能理解为顾及你的感受
could be out of concern for your feelings

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
也许她不让你参加聚会
Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,060
是因为她想物色新配偶
because she's scouting for a new mate

93
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,810
但不想让你看到
and don't want to do it in front of you.

94
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,030
她真贴心
Oh... how kind of her.

95
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,470
同意
Agreed.

96
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,900
大多数灵长类动物没有这种判断力
Most primates don't show that sort of discretion.

97
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,500
雌性倭黑猩猩会在前配偶面前
A female bonobo will copulate with a new male

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,670
与新配偶交配
in front of the old one

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,570
根本不会想"你怎么样"
without so much as a "how do you do?"

100
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,910
你老是这样  知道吗
You always do this, you know?

101
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,900
抛下我去追没有机会追到的女人
You ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with.

102
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,830
我完全有机会
I totally had a shot. With a woman

103
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,160
在公园追逐一名女子
you were chasing through a park--

104
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,930
这不叫机会  这叫重罪
that's not a shot, that's a felony.

105
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,980
搭上我赢回来的帕唐风筝更罪加一等
What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite.

106
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,710
谢尔顿  能不能行行好
Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance

107
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,020
把风筝还给我
you could give me my kite back?

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,370
对不起  拉杰  空战的规则
I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare

109
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,630
规定战败的风筝归胜者
dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor.

110
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,270
没有规则  比赛就没有意义
And without rules, the competition has no meaning.

111
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,600
没有比赛意义
And without meaning,

112
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,400
下面的动作就只会是个空洞的姿态
the following would be an empty gesture.

113
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,970
你的风筝归我了
I have your kite.

114
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,730
你的橄榄球派对如何
How was your football party?

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,700
-很不错  我们赢了  -哇
- It was pretty good. We won.  - Oh, wow.

116
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,170
太棒了
That's excellent.

117
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,970
你不觉得这个比喻很怪吗
It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it

118
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,900
不是我们在玩  却说"我们赢了"
"We won" when you weren't actually playing.

119
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,130
当我们看《星球大战》的时候
When we watch Star Wars,

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,770
我们不会说"我们打败了帝国"
we don't say, "We defeated the Empire."

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,330
很高兴听你这么说
I'm glad to hear it.

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,630
对了  还有个相关问题
Oh, hey, on a related subject,

123
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,430
我跟你朋友在一起会让你觉得有失颜面吗
Are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?

124
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,930
天呐  当然不会
Oh, my god, no.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,030
为什么要这么问
Why would you ask that?

126
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,130
我才发现
Well, you know, I just noticed

127
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,380
我还没见过他们呢
I haven't really met any of them.

128
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,730
你肯定见过
Sure you have.

129
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,060
对  我见过你那高大的前男友
Yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend

130
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,060
还有小一点但还是比我高大的前男友
and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend

131
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,960
顺便问一下  他们今天来了吗
By the way, were they here today?

132
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,400
-当然没有  -当然没有
- Of course not.  - Of course not.

133
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,810
为什么要来  为什么我会问
Why would they be? Why would I ask?

134
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,400
为什么我这么无厘头  为什么你不制止我
Why am I rambling? Why don't you stop me?

135
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,950
莱纳德
Leonard, look,

136
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,100
如果你想见我的朋友  当然很好啦
if you want to meet my friends, that would be great.

137
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,830
我只是  不想让你觉得太无聊
I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.

138
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,340
我才不会觉得无聊呢
I wouldn't be bored.

139
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,770
为什么我会无聊
Why would I be bored?

140
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,430
因为他们不是天才科学家啊
Well, 'cause they're not genius scientists.

141
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,910
佩妮  我喜欢各种各样的人
Penny, I like all sorts of people.

142
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,280
事实上  我最好的一些朋友并不是天才
In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.

143
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,320
比如说
Like who?

144
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,070
好吧  我的某些Facebook朋友不是天才
Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses.

145
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,810
重点在于  如果我们要成为一对
My point is, if we're going to be a couple,

146
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,110
我应该是你朋友的朋友
I should be friends with your friends.

147
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,680
好啊  太棒了  那你下周六
Okay, great. Well, then why don't you

148
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,800
跟我们一起看橄榄球比赛吧
come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.

149
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,010
又有橄榄球赛吗
Another football game?

150
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,640
橄榄球赛每周都有的
They have them every week.

151
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
不知道这回事
Did not know that.

152
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,540
-你想见我的朋友  -当然
- You wanted to meet my friends.  - Sure.

153
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,740
当然  但是我对橄榄球不大了解
Sure, just I don't know much about football.

154
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
那没关系  很多男生的
Oh, that's okay-- a lot of the guys'

155
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,270
女朋友完全不懂橄榄球
girlfriends don't know football.

156
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,000
她们就只在厨房边喝酒边聊天
They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.

157
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,540
"真不错"
Great.

158
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,340
好的  成功的传球
Okay, a complete pass.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,370
一档  新英格兰
First down, New England.

160
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,870
我觉得我开始有点明白了
I think I'm starting to get this.

161
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,140
真的吗
Really?

162
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
过去两小时中我唯一学到的
The only thing I've learned in the last two hours

163
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,770
就是美国男人喜欢喝啤酒
is that American men love drinking beer,

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,270
尿太多导致勃起障碍
pee too often and have trouble getting erections.

165
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,770
把精力放比赛上  而不是广告  拉杰
Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.

166
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,070
我只是说  如果人们能减少啤酒摄入
I'm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer,

167
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,470
就可以从厕所中解脱出来
you could get out of the bathroom

168
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,400
在不使用医药帮助的情况下满足他的女人
and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.

169
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
拉杰  你在这儿干嘛呢
Raj, what are you doing here?

170
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,830
你本该帮我改装我的小摩托
You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.

171
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,950
对不起
I'm sorry,

172
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,850
你还沉浸在我们仍是朋友的印象中吗
are you under the impression that we're still friends?

173
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,160
别这样
Oh, come on.

174
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,700
你不会还在纠结风筝的事情吧
You're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,330
这不仅仅是风筝的事情
It's not just the kite thing.

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,790
每次我们出去玩  你都认为你可以随时
Every time we go some place, you think you can just

177
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,520
把我丢下去追路过的漂亮美眉
dump me whenever someone prettier comes along,

178
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,220
尽管你跟她们完全没可能
even though you don't have a shot with them.

179
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,510
我跟那个跑步的有可能成的
I had a shot with that jogger.

180
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,970
行啊  那找她与你一起往你的小绵羊上画绿焰去
Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.

181
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,280
那不是小绵羊
It's not a little scooter.

182
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,210
那是他们造的第二大小摩托
It's the second biggest Vespa they make!

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,140
你在看橄榄球
Are you watching football?

184
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,270
没跟你开玩笑
There's no fooling you.

185
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,630
屏幕上的"sacks"数据又是什么
Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?

186
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,410
我只知道我妈经常去"Sacks"商店买东西
All I know about Sacks is, my mother shops there.

187
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,490
Sacks，sacks
Sacks, sacks...

188
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,450
这是个橄榄球术语  用于四分卫
It's football nom for when a quarterback is tackled

189
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,050
在启球线之后被擒倒
behind the line of scrimmage.

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,330
启球
Scrimmage.

191
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,060
启球线是一条假想的横截线
The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line

192
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,460
用于区分进攻方与防守方
separating the offense from the defense.

193
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,230
谢尔顿懂橄榄球
Sheldon knows football?

194
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,360
很显然他懂
Apparently.

195
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,860
魁地奇他肯定懂  橄榄球他也懂?
I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?

196
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,630
谢尔顿  你怎么知道这个
Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?

197
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,760
我可是在德克萨斯长大的
I grew up in Texas.

198
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,700
橄榄球在德克萨斯无处不在
Football is ubiquitous in Texas:

199
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,630
职业橄榄球  大学橄榄球
Pro football, college football,

200
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,630
高中橄榄球  初中橄榄球
high school football, peewee football...

201
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,330
事实上  所有种类的橄榄球都有除了最原始的
In fact, every form of football except the original--

202
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,600
欧式橄榄球
European football.

203
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,230
而大部分德克萨斯人认为这是共产党阴谋
Which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.

204
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,990
真难以置信
Unbelivable.

205
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,660
如果你感兴趣  我还知道所有
If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat

206
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,830
似鸡非鸡的炸肉排的相关知识
that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.

207
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
那你能教我吗
So you could teach me?

208
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,560
橄榄球还是炸肉排
Football or chicken-fried meats?

209
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,500
橄榄球
Football.

210
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
我周日要去佩妮家
I'm going to Penny's on Saturday

211
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,820
跟她的朋友们看比赛
to watch a game with her friends

212
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,150
我不想自己看上去像个白痴  我想融入进去
and I don't want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.

213
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,050
如果你想融入佩妮的朋友圈
If you want to blend in with Penny's friends,

214
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,010
我觉得扮作个白痴
I'd think looking like an idiot

215
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,730
会是完美的伪装
would be the perfect camouflage.

216
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,170
别这样  谢尔顿  教我橄榄球吧
Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football.

217
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,660
会很有趣的
It'll be fun.

218
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
这跟我爸说的完全一样
That's exactly what my father said.

219
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,930
"来看球赛吧  去看球赛吧"
"Come to the games. Watch the games."

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,530
周复一周的
Week in and week out from the time

221
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
从五岁直到我上大学
I was five until I went off to college.

222
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,000
人生当中最漫长的七年
Longest seven years of my life.

223
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,480
求你了  这是朋友的请求
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.

224
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,270
你要将这作为一级友情请求吗
Are you making this a tier one friendship request?

225
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,260
是的
Yes.

226
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,610
那好吧
Fine.

227
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,240
-我非常感谢  -算了  算了
- I really appreciate this.  - Yeah, yeah.

228
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,600
那好  呆子  闭嘴  坐下听好
All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.

229
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,770
你说啥
I'm sorry?

230
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,500
我老爸每次讲到橄榄球的话题
That's how my father always began

231
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,340
都是这个开场白
our football conversations.

232
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,470
如果你想的话
And if you'd like,

233
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,500
比赛后
after the game,

234
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,700
我还可以带你出去
I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot

235
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,930
教你射会自己便便的浣熊
Close enough to racoon that craps itself.

236
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,100
你能别再摆弄赛昂吐司了吗(太空堡垒卡拉狄加里的人类天敌)
When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?

237
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,670
待我囤积的吐司大军  足以毁灭传说中
When I have enough to destroy all the human toast

238
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,240
太空堡垒卡拉狄加上的人类吐司之后
on the battlestar known as Galactica.

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,600
你就穿这去佩妮那儿看橄榄球吗
Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?

240
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,600
这件球衣咋不对劲了
What's wrong with a football jersey?

241
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,430
没啥
Nothing.

242
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,470
只是看上去更像特制橄榄球鸡尾酒
That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.

243
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,740
这是最小号的
I's the smallest size they had,

244
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,770
除了狗狗衫以外
except the one for dogs.

245
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,740
难以置信  居然还有专门的狗狗衫
I can't believe they had one for dogs.

246
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,070
当然有了
Oh, yes.

247
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,770
犬类球迷在德州司空见惯
Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas.

248
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,970
但是猫咪却不肯穿运动服
Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel.

249
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,300
我姐有过惨痛教训
My sister found that out the hard way.

250
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
管他的  祝我好运吧
Anyway, wish me luck.

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,540
等等  莱纳德
Leonard, wait.

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,300
你是想通过结交佩妮的朋友
Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted

253
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,700
来维持你俩间的性爱关系
by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure

254
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,900
我这么假设没错吧
your continuing mating privileges with her?

255
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,500
对我来说不尽然如此
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,830
那到底是怎样
How would you put it?

257
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,430
好吧  其实就是你说的那样
Yeah, okay, like you said.

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,430
看来要经历一段性关系
Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,660
还真是麻烦得要命
to go through for intercourse.

260
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,000
你就不能花钱找个妓女吗
Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?

261
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,510
顺便
By the way.

262
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,730
在这种语境下也可以"嗬"一声
Another accepted usage for the term "ho."

263
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,660
再见  谢尔顿
Good-bye, Sheldon.

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,830
等下
Hold on

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,330
我认为按照社会传统规定
I believe that social convention

266
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,360
你可不能两手空空地上门
dictate you not arriving empty-handed.

267
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,360
带些赛昂吐司吧
Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?

268
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,260
不带  我想融入其中  才不想被嘲笑
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.

269
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,900
赛昂吐司有啥好笑
What's funny about Cylon toast?

270
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,530
门没锁
It's open.

271
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,800
好啊  哥们儿
Hey, pal.

272
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,900
你来干嘛
What do you want?

273
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,700
我给你带了件小礼物
I brought you a little gift.

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,430
一只新风筝
New kite.

275
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,400
你害我输掉的那只可是正宗的帕唐风筝
The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang,

276
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,700
是我兄弟从新德里给我寄来的
Indian fighting kite

277
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,430
印度战斗风筝
that my brother sent to me from New Delhi.

278
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,430
我组装了一整天  两天用来上色
It took me a day to put together and two days to paint.

279
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,030
而这是Hello Kitty
This is Hello Kitty.

280
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,860
没错  但这可附带一只零钱袋呢
Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse.

281
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,830
帕唐风筝有吗
Does a Patang?

282
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,430
你还是不懂  是吗
Wow, you just don't get it, do you?

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,230
就算你给我买什么可爱的小玩意
Buying me something pretty isn't going

284
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,100
也不能解决问题
to make our problem just go away.

285
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,100
听我说  我有时候的确
Look, I admit I haven't always been

286
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
不是一个绝佳好友
the best friend I could be.

287
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,900
你根本就是超级烂友  烂到极点
You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.

288
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,300
没说错
Stipulated.

289
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,800
你一直都这样
And you do it all the time.

290
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,660
上周在Radio Shack商场(美国电子产品零售商)
Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking

291
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,730
我们在帮你妈找一部超大号码键的电话
for a phone with giant numbers for your mother,

292
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,100
而我一转眼  你居然就不见了
and I suddenly realize you're not even there.

293
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,730
-我知道  -你去哪儿了
- I know, I know... - And Where were you?

294
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,360
被HDOS快餐店的一个女孩儿勾走了
Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick.

295
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,600
听我解释  她实在很火辣嘛
But in my defense, she was gorgeous!

296
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,870
一边用榨汁机做柠檬汁
And working that squeezer to make the lemonade,

297
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,660
一边上下扭腰摆臀的
going and down and up and down.

298
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,200
简直就是在美食天地中
It was like a free pole dance

299
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,800
免费欣赏钢管舞嘛
right in the middle of the food court.

300
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,360
你真是不可理喻
You're impossible.

301
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,960
至少我不用喝醉酒
Hey, at least I can talk to women

302
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,460
就能和女人交谈自如
without being drunk.

303
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,660
不好意思  我这是选择性缄默症
Excuse me, I have selective mutism,

304
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,730
被鉴定为是生理疾病
a recognized medical disorder.

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
你呢  你不过是个脑残
You're just a douche.

306
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,360
不  知道吗
No. You know what?

307
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,230
也许这才是原因
Maybe that's what this whole thing's about.

308
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,330
你不是在生我的气
You're not mad at me,

309
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
而是气你自己
you're mad at yourself.

310
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,960
不  我就是生你的气
No, I'm mad at you.

311
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,400
我是讨厌自己  但我还是生你的气
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

312
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,930
好吧  你生我气  我明白
Fine. You're mad at me. I get it.

313
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,280
何不今天咱一起过
How about we go spend the day together?

314
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,060
就我们俩
Just the two of us.

315
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,510
你想去哪儿都成
We'll go anywhere you want.

316
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,260
我不知道
I don't know.

317
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,400
别这样嘛
Come on.

318
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,620
我带你去好玩的地方
Let me take you someplace nice.

319
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,790
我很喜欢沥青坑博物馆(展出动物化石的公园)
I-I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

320
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,170
现在去  那交通和停车问题
Really, now? With the traffic and the parking?

321
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,380
管他的  走
Okay, fine.

322
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,250
沥青坑  我们来啦
The Tar Pits. Let's go.

323
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,790
我怎么就对你没辙呢
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

324
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,000
上啊上啊
Go! Go! Go!

325
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,760
快上  太好了
Go-go-go-go! Yes!

326
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
你们没看到吗
Are you people watching this?

327
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,030
这真是太棒了
Is this amazing or what?

328
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,760
亲爱的  现在放的是
Sweetie, that's a highlight

329
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,300
98年冠军赛的比赛集锦
from the '98 championship game.

330
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,630
我不知道
Oh. Did not know that.

331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,630
-你喝了多少  -没喝  怎么
- How much beer have you had? - None, why?

332
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,100
没啥  我只是希望你喝醉了
Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk.

333
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,430
-现在回到现场直播了  -好
- Now we're back live. - Okay, yeah.

334
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,130
我能看出跟之前的差别
I can see the difference.

335
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,810
怎么不掷黄旗  那绝对是故意出界
Oh, where's the flag? That's intentional grounding.

336
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,870
-绝对的  -那完全就是个向前传球
- Totally. - That completely was a forward pass,

337
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,780
也就是说他们故意传球不成功
Which they threw intentionally incomplete

338
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,000
以免被罚码数  或为了节省时间
To avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time

339
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,990
我真不敢相信  裁判甚至不
I can't believe they're not

340
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,210
罚掉他们失去一次进攻机会
Being penalized with the loss of a down

341
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,030
并将启球线
And by having to move the line of scrimmage

342
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
移回到犯规的地方重新开始进攻
Back to the spot of the foul.

343
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,200
来  吃块披萨  亲爱的
Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

344
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,830
佩妮  你知道我有乳糖不耐症的
Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.

345
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,160
我知道  我只想让你别说话
I know. I just need you  stop talking.

346
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,360
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny. Penny.

347
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
-谢尔顿  进来吧  -谢谢
- Sheldon, come in. - Thank you.

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,500
我想做三明治  但没面包了
I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.

349
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,230
冰箱里有
There's some in the fridge.

350
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,060
你不该把面包放冰箱里的
You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator.

351
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,560
淀粉分子间的结晶作用  会让面包变硬
Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules,

352
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,030
在低温条件下  这一过程会加速
Which occurs faster at cool temperatures.

353
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,600
在地球上  我们都说"谢谢"
On Earth, we say "thank you."

354
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,730
莱纳德  鹦鹉学舌得怎么样
So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?

355
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,230
鹦鹉学舌
"Mimesis"?

356
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,460
你知道的  鹦鹉学舌
You know. Mimesis.

357
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,760
就是鹦鹉学着某个特定的目标或人物
An action in which the mimic takes on the properties

358
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,530
模仿他们的行为
of a specific object or organism.

359
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,560
鹦鹉学舌
Mimesis.

360
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,330
你到底在说什么啊
What the hell are you talking about?

361
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,960
我是在跟你交流
I'm attempting to communicate with you

362
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,830
又不想让你周围的人明白
Without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you.

363
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,360
我再试一次好了
Let me try again.

364
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,330
这几个"本地物种"
Have the indigenous fauna

365
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,630
接受你为他们中一员了吗
Accepted you as one of their own?

366
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,690
咯吱咯吱  使使眼色
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

367
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,630
我想是吧
Oh, I guess so.

368
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,690
很好  顺便提醒你
Good. Oh, FYI.

369
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,500
我吃完三明治之后  我就带库萨帕里的
After I eat my sandwich, I'm taking Koothrappali's

370
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,260
帕唐风筝出去试飞一下
Patang kite out for a test run.

371
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,030
你想带着你的三角翼猛禽  跟我一起去吗
Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?

372
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,670
谢尔顿  我不想去放风筝
I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon.

373
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,990
我们正看球赛呢
We're watching football here.

374
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,340
我看得出来
I can see that.

375
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,430
只是给你另外一个选择而已
I was providing you with an alternative.

376
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,730
而且是之前从未在类似情况下提供过的恩惠
A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.

377
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,660
快看
Oh, look at that.

378
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,850
俄克拉荷马的主教练掷红旗
The Oklahoma coach throw down a red flag

379
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,910
表明他对场上裁决表示异议
Indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field.

380
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,100
希望他是对的  不然的话
I hope he's right, 'cause if he'not,

381
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
他就要付出三次暂停中的一次作为代价了
It'll cost him one of his three time-outs.

382
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,780
莱纳德  亲爱的
You know, Leonard, honey,

383
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,740
你想跟谢尔顿出去斗风筝的话  我不介意的
I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.

384
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,560
不  我想看完这比赛
No, I'll watch the end of the game.

385
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
再说  反正也就剩三分钟了
Besides, there's only three minutes left.

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,330
上半场剩三分钟
Until halftime.

387
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
才到上半场结束
This is justalf?

388
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,900
都几个小时了
We've been here for hours.

389
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,530
还得再有几个小时
And you're gonna be here for a couple more.

390
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,870
-你开什么玩笑  -没开玩笑
- Oh, you're kidding me. - No.

391
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,650
很高兴见到各位
Nice meeting all of you.

392
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,830
是啊  那啥  那就是我男朋友
So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend.

393
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,830
他真的很聪明
He is really smart.

394
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,830
这剑齿猫[即剑齿虎]我真的很喜欢
I really like my saber-toothed cat.

395
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
谢谢你
Thank you.

396
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,130
别客气
My pleasure.

397
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,360
也许午饭后  我们还可以去圣安东尼奥餐厅
Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender's

398
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,700
吃几个派
And have some pie.

399
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,160
我很想去
I'd like it.

400
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
这真是一个完美的周六
This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.

401
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,830
很好  我很荣幸
Good.I'm glad.

402
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,130
兄弟  看到她怎么对我笑了吗
Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?

403
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
好吧  你去好了
Fine. Go ahead.

404
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,460
不行  今儿就我们俩过
No. This is our day.

405
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,560
想去追的话  就去吧
If you want to chase after her,chase after her.

406
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,800
开什么玩笑  那样的女孩  我一点机会都没有的
Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have a shot with a girl like that.

407
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,310
别这么妄自菲薄
Don't put yourself down.

408
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,940
你还是很有吸引力的
You're a very attractive man.

409
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,620
-你真这么想  -对
- You think so?  - Yeah.

410
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,570
当然  虽然我不会强迫你跟我去上
Absolutely. It wouldn't kill you

411
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,640
普拉提锻炼肌肉
To take a Pilates class with me now and then,

412
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,360
但你的竹竿身材还是有点吸引力的
But you have a certain wiry appeal

413
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,200
是啊  都无所谓了
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter

414
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,400
因为她又没真的对我笑
'cause she wasn't really smiling at me.

415
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,100
事实上  这次我觉得她确实有
Actually, in this case, I think she was.

416
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,760
真的
Really?

417
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,770
-真的  -回见
- Yeah. - Bye.

418
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,700
真是个傻瓜
What a douche.
