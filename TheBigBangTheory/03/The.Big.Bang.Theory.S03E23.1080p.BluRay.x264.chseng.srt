1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,710
搞定  激光接上电源了
Ok, we've got the power to the laser.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,550
我应该带把伞来的
I should've brought an umbrella.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,640
作甚啊  又不会下雨
What for? It's not gonna rain.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,630
我知道
I know that.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,910
但我如此白嫩的肌肤还是有可能被月光灼伤的
But with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is real possibility.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,440
这是个"逗你玩儿"  对吧
That's a "Bazinga," Right?

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,110
我的巅峰之作  你觉得呢
One of my best, don't you think?

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,580
霍华德  你要不要再检查一下 激光上的赤道仪装置
Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser?

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,520
我们得把它锁定到"宁静之海"上  [月面某部名称]
We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
没问题
You got it.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,020
天  拉杰  别这样
Oh, Raj, no.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,060
人们花了无数美元发明了英特网
Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,030
并在上面发了无数艳照
and filling it with pictures of naked women,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,760
就是为了让我们不需要通过窗户来偷窥啊
so we don't have to peep through windows.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,100
我才没有呢
It's not like that.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,200
我只不过在看别人的电视而已
I'm watching someone's TV.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,770
正在播《傲骨贤妻》呢
The Good Wife is on.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,210
告诉你  这就是我的新《实习医生格蕾》
I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,810
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard, Leonard.

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,940
那是啥  那是啥
What is that? What is that?

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,210
别紧张  不就是只脏袜子嘛
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,410
你怎么可以如此淡定的把
How on earth can you say

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,050
"脏袜子"和"别紧张"放在同一句话里
"Dirty sock" And "Relax" In the same sentence?

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,490
谢尔顿  这个世界上到处都有被遗弃的脏袜子
Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.

25
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,690
我的世界可没有
Not my world.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,560
嘿  你们知道谁会非常想看这个实验吗  佩妮
Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,100
我怎么不知道她喜欢月面搜索呢
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing.

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,070
尽管我可以确定尼尔·阿姆斯特朗留在月球上的
Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,770
回复反射器的确符合了亮晶晶的标准
by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,310
那你怎么不叫她上来
Why don't you ask her to come up?

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,580
不知道  自从那之后就有点怪怪的
I don't know, it's still a little weird since, you know...

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,730
-她甩了你吗  -她没有甩了我
- She dumped you?  - She didn't dump me.

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,220
我们只不过在这段关系中处在不同方位罢了
We were just in different places in the relationship.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,950
我不明白为什么一段情缘
I fail to see how a relationship

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,390
还能有地理位置的特性
can have the qualities of a geographic location.

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,320
唔  这很简单
Oh, it's very simple.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,520
莱纳德住在一个叫做"请别离开"的小镇里
Leonard was living in a little town called "Please don't leave me"

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,660
而佩妮则刚搬到了一个叫"拜拜"的小岛上
while Penny had just moved to the island of "Buh-bye."

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,300
去你丫的
Screw you guys.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,800
我去看看她在不在家
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,890
如果方便的话
If it's not too much trouble,

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,130
我想把望远镜瞄准月球了
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

43
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,910
且慢
Wait a second.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,370
好老婆正哭呢
The good wife is crying.

45
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,140
出大问题了
Something's very wrong.

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,210
生活大爆炸第三季第二十三集 [本季完]

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,560
嘿  怎么了
Oh, hi. What's going on?

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,990
我们在屋顶上尝试从月球将激光射回来呢
We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,470
抱歉  什么
I'm sorry, what?

50
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,510
很酷的哦
It's pretty cool.

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
我们准备了直径两米的反射器和其他仪器
We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything.

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,040
我觉得你可能会想来看看
I thought you might want to see it.

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,140
这完全说不通啊
That makes no sense.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,610
你怎么可能从月球上弹射东西
How can you bounce stuff off the moon?

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,210
那儿可没有重力
There's no gravity.

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,590
呃  莱纳德
Uh, Leonard,

57
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,950
-这是扎克  扎克  这是莱纳德  -嘿
- This is Zack. Zack, Leonard.  - Hey.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
抱歉  我不知道你们正忙呢  或许下次吧
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Maybe another time.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
嗯  或许吧
Yeah, maybe.

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
嗨  我想看看这个激光
Hey, I want to see this laser thing.

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,490
但那个派对怎么办
Oh, but what about the party?

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,960
只不过是个惊喜派对而已  什么时候到完全没所谓
It's a surprise party-- doesn't matter when we get there.

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,350
那倒是
Right.

64
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,400
那好吧  上来吧
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
你们是如何认识的呢
So, how'd you guys meet?

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,070
我的公司为芝士工厂设计菜单
My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.

67
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,330
你的公司
Your company?

68
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,120
事实上是我爸的  但我和我妹妹是副总
Well, my dad. But me and my sister are VPs.

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,370
呃  菜单啊
So... menus.

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,310
听起来貌似简单  但在设计当中 是包含了不少科学知识的
I know it sounds easy, but there's a lot of science that goes into designing them.

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,120
开心了吧 我把脏袜子丢开了
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
谢谢
Thank you.

73
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,990
拉杰  时刻注意另外一只
Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

74
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,690
各位  这是我朋友扎克
Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,700
-你好扎克  -哇哦
- Hello. Zack.  - Whoa!

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,830
这就是那激光吗
Is that the laser?

77
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,700
太他妈帅了
It's bitchin'.

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
没错
Yes.

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,540
1917年  当爱因斯坦在他的文章
In 1917, when Albert Einstein established

80
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,170
《关于辐射的量子理论中》阐述了
the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,210
激光的理论基础时  他最诚挚的希望
"Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung," His fondest hope

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,550
就是最终的仪器要很他妈的帅
was that the resultant device be bitchin'.

83
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,580
唔  那任务达成了
Well, mission accomplished.

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,850
让我来解释一下我们在做什么
Let me explain what we're doing here.

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,850
1969年  阿波罗11号上的宇航员
Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11

86
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,160
在月面安置了数个反射器 而我们则要发射激光
positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,560
到其中的一个上面并反射回来 到这个光电倍增器上
one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,400
哇  那很酷啊
Oh! That's very cool.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
只有一个问题
One question.

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,200
你怎么确定它不会爆炸
How can you be sure it won't blow up?

91
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,940
激光吗
The laser?

92
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,370
月球
The moon.

93
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,540
看  这才是配得上佩妮的男人
See, now this is a man for Penny.

94
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,180
问得好  扎克
That's a great question, Zack.

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,080
才不是呢
No, it's not.

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,490
要友好
Play nice.

98
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,790
问得不好
It's not a great question.

99
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,120
怎么能有人觉得 我们会炸掉月球
How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?

100
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,330
这才叫问得好
That's a great question.

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,330
不用担心月球
Don't worry about the moon.

102
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,770
我们把激光调弱了
We-We set our laser to stun.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,330
聪明
Smart.

104
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,940
发射时我们能看到光束
Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves,

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,770
但返回时的光束减弱
but it won't be strong enough when it comes back

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,010
裸眼看不到
to be seen by the naked eye.

107
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,070
裸
Naked.

108
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,710
是很搞笑
Right. Uh... funny.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,900
那个装置能测量返回的光子
Uh, that device, there, will measure the photons that return

110
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,850
我们能在电脑上看到
and let us see it on this computer.

111
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,410
拉杰  给他们眼镜
Raj, get them some glasses.

112
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,930
酷  还有三维效果
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

113
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,130
准备向月球发射激光
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

114
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,670
开始吧
Make it so.

115
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,640
有了  看到峰值了
There it is. There's the spike!

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,100
返回时间2.5秒
2.5 seconds for the light to return.

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,870
是月球  我们击中月球了
That's the moon! We hit the moon!

118
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,850
这就是你们的大实验
That's your big experiment?

119
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,420
搞这么多就为了屏幕上的一条线
All that for a line on the screen?

120
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,410
话虽如此 想想这代表着什么
Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents.

121
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,490
我们的实验是唯一
The fact that we can do this is the only way

122
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,860
能证明月球上有人造物体的实验
of definitively proving that there are man-made objectson the moon,

123
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,790
这个物体是60年前刚发明飞机的
put there by a member of a species

124
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,090
种族中一员放上去的
that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.

125
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,260
那是什么种族啊
What species is that?

126
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,230
我错了
I was wrong.

127
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,590
佩妮能找更好的
Penny can do better.

128
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,900
-好了  谢谢各位  很有意思  -谢谢
- Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.  - Yeah, thanks.

129
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,710
-能请他们参加派对吗  -不行  只管走
- Should we invite them to the party?  - No, just keep walking.

130
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,440
他肯定交媾技能很强
He must be very skilled at coitus.

131
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,310
告诉你  唯一能让你
I'm telling you, dude, the only way

132
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,110
接受佩妮结交新欢的办法
to feel better about Penny going out with other guys

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,850
就是再奸再厉
is for you to get back on the whores.

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
接
Horse.

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,260
什么
What?

136
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,120
那个词是"再接再厉"
The phrase is "Get back on the horse,"

137
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,590
不是"奸"
not "Whores."

138
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,930
老兄  你真恶心
That's disgusting, dude.

139
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,700
不是
No, it's not...

140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,190
算了
Never mind.

141
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,070
不过他说得对
He is right, though.

142
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,240
你愿意的话  我可以给你介绍
If you want, I can turn you on to this great new

143
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,970
-我找到的新交友网  -不了  谢谢
- dating site I found.  - No, thanks.

144
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,210
你确定  上面说能给任何人牵红线
You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,880
他们给你牵了吗
Have they found a match for you?

146
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,910
多着呢  上个月就有八个呢
Tons. I've had, like, eight dates in the last month.

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,230
如果算上见我就闪的  有12个呢
And 12 if you count the ones who showed up and left.

148
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,790
我无法搬氮气罐下来
I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.

149
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,990
-为什么  -我重申一遍
- Why not?  - All right, let me restate that.

150
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,060
它很重  我不想搬
It's very heavy, and I don't want to.

151
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,030
我去搬吧
I'll help you.

152
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,290
谢谢
Thank you.

153
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,030
用膝盖  别用背
Lift with your knees, not your back.

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,030
晚安
Good night.

155
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,070
知道什么才好玩吗
You know what would be fun?

156
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,370
帮谢尔顿申请网上交友
Signing Sheldon up for online dating.

157
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,370
算了吧
Yeah, right.

158
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,340
不  想一想
No, think about it.

159
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,640
我们当实验做
We make it an experiment.

160
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,050
就像寂寞的科学怪人
Like when Frankenstein's monster

161
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,160
找了个老婆
was lonely and he found a wife.

162
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,510
他没有找老婆
He didn't find a wife.

163
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,620
而是用死尸器官造了个老婆
They built him a wife out of dead body parts.

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,690
那可以作为后备计划
Okay, we'll call that plan B.

165
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,200
来了
Coming!

166
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,670
你个该死的混蛋
Damn you, you rat bastard.

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,370
你醉啦
Are you drunk?

168
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,940
扎克是个绝好男友  你把他毁了
Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!

169
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,810
我怎么把他毁了
How did I ruin him?

170
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,310
因为以前 我绝不会觉得他蠢
'Cause in the olden days, i never would've known he was so stupid.

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
拜托  他没那么蠢
Come on, he wasn't that stupid.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,490
不  他够蠢了 他觉得你们会炸掉月球
Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!

173
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,960
对  他确实很蠢
Okay, yeah, he's stupid.

174
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,630
他一整晚都在吹嘘
He spent the entire night bragging

175
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,300
自己怎么造出"阑胃菜"这个词
about how he invented the word "Appe-teasers."

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,570
这不是我的错吧
How is that my fault?

177
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,580
你毁了我容忍傻逼的能力
You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots.

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,980
现在跟我走
Now, come with me.

179
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,210
去哪
Wh-Where are we going?

180
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,580
我们去做爱
We're gonna have sex.

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,780
为啥  不过我没意见
Why? I mean, okay.

182
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,190
怎么回事
What's going on?

183
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,120
把你的降噪耳机戴上
Put on your noise-canceling headphones,

184
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,290
这边会很吵的
'cause it's gonna get loud.

185
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,130
怎么又来了
Oh! Not this again.

186
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,750
这怎么可能是少果肉呢
In what universe is this low-pulp?

187
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,410
早啊  佩妮
Good morning, Penny.

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
你后脑勺长眼睛了吗
What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?

189
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,810
隔天就在学校挨揍的某人
When one gets beaten up every other day in school,

190
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,910
必然会进化出更敏锐的听觉
one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing.

191
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,150
而且  在学校挨揍的某人
Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,280
通常都把自己称为"某人"
simply by referring to oneself as "One."

193
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
我准备做英式松饼
I'm making English muffins.

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,310
你想吃吗
Would you like an English muffin?

195
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,660
-不了  我不饿  -另外
- Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.  - FYI,

196
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,590
昨晚证明我的降噪耳机无效
my noise-canceling headphones proved ineffective last night.

197
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,610
不好意思
Yeah, sorry about that.

198
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,260
作为本土德州人  我得说"驾"这个词
As a native Texan,I must say I've never heard the phrase "Yee-haw"

199
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,370
在交媾中很少用到
used in quite that context.

200
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,300
天呐
Oh, God.

201
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,440
天呐
"Oh, God."

202
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,740
这个我倒是听过很多次
That I've heard on multiple occasions.

203
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,250
这算哪门子"微"烤
In what universe is that lightly toasted?

204
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,550
今天真是我一生之中最扯淡的一天
This has to be the worst day of my life.

205
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,890
早啊  莱纳德
Good morning, Leonard.

206
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,050
我告诉过你多少次了不要那么做
How many times have I asked you not to do that?

207
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,530
算上这次吗  317次
Counting this instance? 317.

208
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,780
佩妮呢
Where's Penny?

209
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,430
她回她家去了
She returned to her apartment.

210
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,170
我猜应该是去洗澡加呕吐了
I presume to shower and vomit.

211
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,220
顺序不一定是按这个
Not necessarily in that order.

212
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,740
她为啥都没道别一下呢
I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.

213
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,780
你是在叫我解释一下人类行为吗
Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior?

214
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,890
难为你了  我只是觉得
I know. I just thought as an outsider,

215
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,390
当局者迷  旁观者清嘛
you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
我相信你个小东西绝对不是黄油
I have no difficulty believing you're not butter.

217
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,030
-嘿  -嗨
- Oh, hey. - Oh, hi.

218
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,000
我得赶紧走了  早班
Um, I gotta run. Early shift.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,740
好啊  我和你一起下楼
Okay, I'll walk down with you.

220
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,190
昨晚挺有意思的  对吧
So, last night was fun, huh?

221
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,040
那必须的
Yeah, it must have been.

222
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
我刚吐在我壁橱里了
I just threw up in my closet.

223
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,510
杯具啊
Bummer.

224
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,610
我在想啊  咱俩今晚 去看场电影如何
Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.

225
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,510
今晚我不太方便
Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,980
不一定是今天晚上
Doesn't have to be tonight.

227
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,320
我差不多啥时候都有空
I'm free pretty much always.

228
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,190
莱纳德  昨晚那件事是个错误
Leonard, last night was a mistake.

229
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,530
你说"错误"  是塞翁失马那种吗
When you say "Mistake," Do you mean a fortunate mistake,

230
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,260
就比如发现青霉素
like the discovery of penicillin?

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,290
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

232
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,020
我喝高了  很寂寞  我讨厌扎克
I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

233
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,830
咱俩就当没发生过好吗
Can we just forget it ever happened?

234
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,470
不行  整件事几乎已经刻在我脑子里了
No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

235
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,280
特别是骑术表演那部分
Especially the whole rodeo thing.

236
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,610
老天
Oh, God!

237
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,910
就这样啊
So, that's it?

238
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,510
提上裤子就不认人啦
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

239
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,080
我都道歉了  你就别纠结这事儿了行吗
Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't you please let it go?

240
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,680
你说的倒轻松啊
How am I supposed to let it go?

241
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,550
你居然把我当泄欲对象
You used me for sex!

242
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,090
早安  冈德森太太
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

243
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,660
早啊  莱纳德
Good morning, Leonard.

244
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,830
或者我该说  "驾"
Or should I say "Yee-haw"?

245
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,440
-我靠  -怎么了
- Holy crap. - What?

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,220
我们终于证实了人类之中藏有外星人
We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.

247
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,770
你说啥
Excuse me?

248
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,680
这个约会网站找到了个适合谢尔顿的女人
The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,150
不可能吧
You're kidding.

250
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,350
一个实实在在的女人
An actual woman?

251
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,650
你看  胸部  该有的都有
Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

252
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,920
相信我  有胸的不一定就是女人
Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.

253
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,290
-啥时候有这么一说  -我回头给你看张
- Since when? - I'll show you a picture

254
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,330
我路易叔叔穿泳装的照片
of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime.

255
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,210
莱纳德  快来看啊
Leonard, you gotta see this.

256
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,910
我们居然找到适合谢尔顿的姑娘了
We found a match for Sheldon.

257
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,670
很好
Great.

258
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,270
说不定她会跟他上床  然后第二天一早
Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him

259
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,300
连个招呼都不打就闪人
the next morning without so much as a "How do you do?"

260
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,030
你知道他说啥呢吗
Do you know what he's talking about?

261
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,260
不知道  你问问呗
Nope. Why don't you ask him?

262
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,420
莱纳德  你说啥呢
Leonard, what are you talking about?

263
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,620
我不想谈这个
I don't want to talk about it.

264
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,640
瞧你出的这馊主意
That was a lousy suggestion.

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,510
随便啦  现在
Whatever. Right now,

266
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,050
谢尔顿·库珀博士要给他的真命天女
Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail

267
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,780
发封邮件
to his perfect match.

268
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,520
"您好  同类生物"
"Greetings, fellow life-form..."

269
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,080
她能做到  那我也能  她能做到  那我也能
If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.

270
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,580
她能做到  那我也能
If she can do it, I can do it.

271
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,630
我无能了
I can't do it.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,770
-谁啊  -你好
- Hello? - Oh, hi. Hey.

273
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,570
你好啊  莱斯利
Hi, Leslie.

274
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,370
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德  有何贵干
Leonard Hofstadter. What're you doing here?

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,710
是啊  咱俩好久没见了
Uh, I know! It's been a while!

276
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,080
对啊  18个月
Yeah, 18 months.

277
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,450
是啊  是啊
Right. Right.

278
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,350
你怎么样啊
So how you doing?

279
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,380
挺好的  你呢
Fine. You?

280
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,790
不错
Uh, not bad.

281
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,940
你还记得之前咱俩上床
You remember when we used to have sex

282
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,590
你说这事儿没什么实际意义  只是为了娱乐
and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?

283
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,590
是啊
Yeah.

284
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,030
你想再来一次吗
You, uh, want to do that again?

285
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,830
怎么了  金发美女把你甩了
What happened? Blondie dumped you?

286
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,730
不是她甩我
She didn't dump me.

287
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,100
我俩处在一段关系里的不同位置
We were just in different places in the relationship.

288
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,540
是嘛
Right.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,910
随便了  显然呢
Um... anyway, apparently,

290
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
找个好久不见的人然后俩人
it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,610
娱乐性地打一炮也没啥不好的吧
and have recreational sex with them.

292
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,280
你觉得如何
So, what do you say?

293
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,420
我考虑下哈
Let me think about it.

294
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,670
她不会再开门了
She's not coming back.

295
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,900
她想见我们
She wants to meet us.

296
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,470
不是我们  是他
Not us. Him.

297
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,870
是啊  可是他根本不认识她
Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.

298
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,940
哎呀  他会认识她的
Well, him about to find out about her.

299
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,210
真的吗  我们要告诉他吗
Really? Us gonna tell him?

300
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,800
谁要告诉谁什么
Who's going to tell whom about what?

301
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,870
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

302
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,980
嗨
Hey. Hi.

303
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,530
你们这么惊讶让我很困惑
Your surprise confuses me.

304
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,050
我住在这儿
I live here.

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
是啊
Right.

306
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,120
那个啥  明天下午你什么安排
So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?

307
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,560
说的具体点
Be more specific.

308
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,760
四点半
4:30.

309
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,990
那不是下午
That's not afternoon.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,460
那是下午晚
That's preevning.

311
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,460
什么
What?

312
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,170
是我发明的描述时间方式
It's a time of day I invented.

313
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,670
更好地定义了个模棱两可的时段
It better defines the ambiguous period

314
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,240
下午和晚上之间  就是傍晚
between afternoon and evening: preevning.

315
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,840
我确信因为急需精确描述  这词定会广为流传
I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.

316
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,310
好吧
Right, okay.

317
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,710
那你明天傍晚准备做什么
What are you doing tomorrow preevning?

318
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,250
明天是周六
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,020
周六晚是洗衣夜
Saturday night is laundry night.

320
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,090
所以傍晚我会用来预分选衣物
So I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting

321
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,620
并预浸湿
and pre-soaking.

322
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,320
如果我告诉你  明天4点半
Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30,

323
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,130
你将遇到
you could meet a woman

324
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,900
科学挑选出来的  你的完美伴侣呢
who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?

325
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,630
我会嘲讽地哼一声  无奈地摊开双手
I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air,

326
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,040
疲于应付你们这种经常的无聊之举
exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

327
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,540
但这是真的
But it's true.

328
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,900
我们把你所有重要信息上传到了交友网站
But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site,

329
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
学着你的方式回答了他们所有问题
answered all their questions just like you would,

330
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,520
他们找到了个跟你匹配的  她叫艾米·菲拉·福勒
and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.

331
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,920
拜托
Please.

332
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,620
即使你们学得像我的回答
Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would,

333
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,990
这种红娘网站的算法  本身就是胡扯的
the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

334
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,190
他们问到这个问题的时候  我们就是这么回答的
And that's exactly the answer we gave to the question:

335
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,860
你对在线交友持何态度
"What is your attitude towards online dating?"

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
霍华德想回答"毫无意义"  但我认为不是
Howard wanted to write "Mumbo jumbo," But I said no.

337
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,540
咱谢尔顿会回答"胡扯"
Our Sheldon would say "Hokum."

338
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,910
拜托  你的科学好奇心呢
Come on, where's your scientific curiosity?

339
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,880
大部分都用来探索宇宙的秘密了
Well, most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe

340
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,350
剩下的则用来思考  我为何要跟你们聊这个了
while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.

341
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,310
好吧  这么说吧
Okay, how about this.

342
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,050
即使史波克每七年也会约会一次的
Even Spock had a date once every seven years.

343
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,220
他那不是约会
He didn't date.

344
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,490
那是发情期到了
It was Pon Farr.

345
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,890
他因压抑的性欲而热血沸腾
His blood boiled with mating lust.

346
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,920
那你何不先喝上杯咖啡
Well, why-why don't you start with a cup of coffee,

347
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,600
晚点就可以跟艾米·菲拉·福勒发发情了
and you can Pon Farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.

348
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,450
我不喝咖啡的
I don't drink coffee.

349
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,100
好吧  那就喝杯热巧克力
All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

350
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,080
反正我不会去做这种无聊事  选什么饮料无关紧要
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,my choice of beverage is moot.

351
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,880
但我正式说明下
But for the record,

352
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,240
（每年九月至次年四月  月份英文中都带有R字母）
我只在月份中带有R字母那月才喝热巧克力
I only drink hot chocolate in months with an "R" In them.

353
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,880
为什么
Why?

354
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,050
不为无益之事  何以遣有涯之生
What's life without whimsy?

355
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,520
好吧  我没辙了
Okay, I'm out.

356
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,590
谢尔顿  我把屋顶拿来的一只脏袜子
Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof

357
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,790
藏在你们公寓里了
somewhere in your apartment.

358
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
除非你愿意跟我们去见那女孩
Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl,

359
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,770
不然  它会永远藏在那
it will remain there forever.

360
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,300
你只是在吓唬我
You're bluffing.

361
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,700
你真愿意冒这个险吗
Are you willing to risk it?

362
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,750
诅咒你
Curse you.

363
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,300
30英尺
30 feet.

364
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,540
你好  莱纳德
Oh. Hey, Leonard.

365
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,770
我本是个完美的小个子剩男  快乐又书呆
I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy,

366
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,120
是你毁了我
and you ruined me!

367
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,200
你喝醉了吗
Are you drunk?

368
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,390
拜托  我们上床吧  反正也是没有意义的
Come on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!

369
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,230
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?!

370
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,860
我真的开始认为  这是双重标准了
I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.

371
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
几分钟后
In a few minutes,

372
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,640
等我幸灾乐祸地冷眼旁观着本次相亲的失败
when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise,

373
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,720
你们更愿意我怎么做
how would you prefer I do it?

374
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
是标准答案  我早说过会这样
The standard "I told you so"?

375
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,240
还是经典的"哦也哦也"[表嘲讽]
The classic "Neener-neener"?

376
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
还是用我平常那副高傲嘲弄的表情
Or just my normal look of haughty derision?

377
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,970
现在还不能断定我们错了
You don't know we're wrong yet.

378
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,780
还是高傲嘲弄表情吧
Haughty derision it is.

379
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,240
打扰下
Excuse me.

380
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,670
我是艾米·菲拉·福勒  你是谢尔顿·库珀
I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.

381
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
你好  艾米·菲拉·福勒
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

382
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,650
我很遗憾地告诉你  你上当了
I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in

383
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,980
被设计用来欺骗
by unsupportable mathematics

384
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,950
很傻很天真剩男剩女的无知算法骗了
designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely.

385
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,990
此外  我是被一只藏起来的脏袜子勒索了才来的
Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.

386
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,060
那是俚语的话  我从没听说过
If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

387
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,860
要是字面意义的话  我跟你一样讨厌脏袜子
If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

388
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,150
无论如何  我来这是因为答应了我妈
In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed

389
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,050
每年至少约会一次
that I will date at least once a year.

390
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,970
有意思
Interesting.

391
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,310
我跟我妈在关于上教堂这点上  有过同样对话
My mother and I have the same agreement about church.

392
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,400
我并不反对神的概念
I don't object to the concept of a deity,

393
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,070
但实在不理解  上教堂还得点名
but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.

394
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,160
那你应该不会想去德州东部
Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.

395
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,750
记住了
Noted.

396
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,350
相亲继续进行之前
Now, before this goes any further,

397
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,790
我先声明  所有身体接触
you should know that all forms of physical contact

398
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,090
包括但并不限于交媾  均不予讨论
up to and including coitus are off the table.

399
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,860
能请你喝杯饮料吗
May I buy you a beverage?

400
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,870
温水  谢谢
Tepid water, please.

401
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,670
天哪  瞧瞧我们干了什么
Good God, what have we done?
