1
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,300
你发什么疯呢
Whatcha doing?

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,150
我在尝试以瞬时环形影像来审视我的成果
I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,060
来激活我的上丘脑
so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,640
真有趣
Interesting.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,440
我一般喝点咖啡就行了
I usually just have coffee.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,760
你彻夜未眠吗
You've been up all night?

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,850
早上了吗
Is it morning?

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,570
是的
Yes.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,250
那我就是彻夜未眠了
Then I've been up all night.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,360
你卡壳了
And you're stuck?

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,710
要不然怎么会有人想要激活上丘脑
Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,620
真抱歉  亲爱的  喝完咖啡前我可帮不了你
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,770
佩妮  我早就告诉过你  你要不把他关到他房间里
Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,740
他会在公寓里上蹿下跳一整夜
he just runs around the apartment.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,310
现在又是在干嘛
What is he doing now?

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,330
他要不是在分解公式的项
Hmm, he's either isolating the terms

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,600
一一检验的话
of his formula and examining them individually,

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,860
就是在...
or...

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,830
寻找在被彼得潘削掉之后
looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,740
让短吻鳄吞噬的手
after Peter Pan cut it off.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,610
虎克船长的手是被鳄鱼吃掉的
Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile,

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,180
不是短吻鳄
not an alligator.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,740
你要想损我  至少把事实给弄清楚先
If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,150
遵命  船长
Aye, aye, Captain.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,620
我就不明白了
I can't see it!

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,280
怎么就结合不起来呢
It just won't coalesce.

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,000
也许你应该重新开始
Maybe you need a fresh start.

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,130
有道理
You're right.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,020
真是个好主意  莱纳德  谢谢
It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,500
生活大爆炸第三季第十四集

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,080
当电子穿越石墨烯时
Electrons move through graphene...

32
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,490
所表现出的质量为零
act as if they have no mass...

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,430
他卡壳多久了
How long has he been stuck?

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,430
智商上有三十小时了
Intellectually about 30 hours.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,350
情商嘛  二十九年了
Emotionally about 29 years.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
单元晶格包涵了两个碳原子
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms...

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,600
六边形的内角为120°
Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.

38
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,650
你试过将他重新启动一下吗
Have you tried rebooting him?

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,910
才不呢  这是固件问题
No, I think it's a firmware problem.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,880
哟  今晚是格兰黛尔的月光溜冰场的
Hey, it's Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink

41
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,860
迪斯科之夜
in Glendale tonight.

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,470
谁要来一起荡一下
Who's up for getting down?

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,630
太完美了
That's perfect.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,660
伯纳黛特一直怂恿我带她去溜冰呢
Bernadette's been hocking me to take her roller skating.

45
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,060
我也觉得佩妮喜欢滑冰
I think Penny likes to skate.

46
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,390
我们四个可以两两成对
The four of us could double.

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,700
再好不过了  我们去
What could be better? We're in.

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,180
真棒  仿佛不是因为我想去才提出来的
Great. It's not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,510
你也可以加入的啊
You can come with us.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
不  没事儿的  我不必去的
No, it's okay. I don't have to go.

51
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,480
我很荣幸能给你和你们的女人
I'm happy just to guide you and your ladies

52
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,200
提供合适的娱乐建议
to suitable entertainment choices.

53
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,880
我就是个棕色人型口碑网
I'm a walking brown Yelp.Com.

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,010
结构  恒定结构  一个原子
Structure, constant structure. One atom...

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,520
天  他真的是走火入魔了  是吗
Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?

56
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,030
嗯啊  他今天早上居然把黄油当成了香体剂
Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,950
我就说怎么闻到了爆米花的味道呢
I thought I smelled popcorn.

58
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,750
模式与费米子在轨道上的移动完全一样
Pattern is the same as fermions travels on the pathways...

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,710
六边的  从来都是六边的
Hexagonal... It's always hexagonal...

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,820
自从他尝试理清《黑客帝国》第三部之后
I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out

61
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,580
我就没见过他能卡成这个样子
the third Matrix movie.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,010
嘿  这可是我的青豆啊
Hey, those are my lima beans!

63
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,320
在哥手里不是青豆  是碳原子
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

64
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,350
但老子在吃掉青豆之前
But if I don't eat my lima beans,

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,600
是不能吃饼干的
I can't have my cookie.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,300
给  你要豌豆吗
Here, you want my peas?

67
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,260
豌豆  太赞了
The peas-- perfect.

68
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,930
正好拿来做电子
They can be electrons.

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,570
要我的玉米不
Want my corn?

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,480
你脑残啊
Don't be ridiculous.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,200
我拿玉米能做什么
What would I do with corn?

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,270
那个滑旱冰  我们去之前是不是先吃饭
So roller skating-- should we all grab a bite to eat first?

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,420
好啊  华馆怎么样
Good. P.F. Chang's?

74
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,840
俺娘有优惠券
My mom has coupons.

75
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,480
行啊
Great.

76
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,750
你娘不会来吧
Your mom's not coming, right?

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,530
我保证这次绝对不来了
Not this time, I promise.

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,700
我要把话说清楚了  滑旱冰是我的主意
Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea,

79
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,010
而我对你们将其变成四人约会表示高度不满
and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date,

80
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,540
我预祝你们都摔屁墩
and I hope you both fall on your asses

81
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,310
摔断尾椎骨
and break your coccyxes.

82
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,530
尾椎骨的英文复数是"coccyges"
The plural of coccyx is coccyges.

83
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,780
去你丫的  还哥青豆
Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,190
我的天呐 你有没试过如此丢人
Oh, my God. Have you ever been so embarrassed?

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,470
至少最近没有
Not recently.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,820
我都说不出他们哪个更烂了
I don't know which was lamer:

87
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,310
到底是寒冰技巧还是他们的迪斯科舞姿
their roller-skating or their disco dancing.

88
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,460
就我而言  最惨的是
For me, the worst part

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,040
人们看到了我们和他们一起离开的
was when people saw us leave with them.

90
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,970
你小子有两手啊  霍华德
You had some nice moves out there, Howard.

91
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,690
谢谢夸奖  你也不错
Thanks. You, too.

92
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,100
你注意到人们看我们的眼神了吗
Did you notice all the people looking at us?

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,770
没怎么注意  我完全沉迷在了舞步中
Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,920
当霍华德想要劈叉的时候
When Howard tried to do the splits...

95
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,310
嘘
Shh.

96
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,160
抱歉  我走得有点慢
Sorry. I'm moving a little slow.

97
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,960
可能是挫伤了尾骨
I think I bruised my coccyx.

98
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,640
可怜的小宝贝
Oh, poor baby.

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
别告诉库萨帕里
Don't tell Koothrappali.

100
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,120
你先请
After you.

101
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,590
真绅士
Oh, what a gentleman.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,050
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

103
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,780
天啊
Oh, my God!

104
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,030
你在
Are you...

105
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,930
我的神啊
Good Lord!

106
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,690
你们把一切都毁了
You're ruining everything!

107
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,620
该死的
Oh, damn.

108
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,530
你没事吧
Are you okay?

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,890
我看起来像没事吗
Do I look okay?

110
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
别冲我发火啊  我也摔了
Don't bark at me. I fell, too.

111
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,270
你都摔一晚上了  也该习惯了
Oh, you've been falling all night. You're used to it.

112
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,750
谢尔顿  你到底在干嘛
Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

113
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,510
做我这三天一直在做的工作
The same thing I've been doing for three days.

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,090
想要弄明白为什么
Trying to figure out why electrons

115
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,690
电子在穿过石墨烯时
behave as if they have no mass

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,670
会表现得像是没有质量一样
when traveling through a graphene sheet.

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,920
用大理石来推测
With marbles?

118
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,750
我总得找点比豆子大的东西
Well, I needed something bigger

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,590
不是吗
than peas, now, didn't I?

120
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,670
谢尔顿  你上次睡觉是什么年代
Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,110
不知道  大概2  3天
I don't know-- two, three days.

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,690
这无关紧要
Not important.

123
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,430
我不需要睡眠  我想要答案
I don't need sleep. I need answers.

124
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,040
我要找出
I need to determine where

125
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,870
在这个充满不平衡方程的沼泽中
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,160
是什么阻碍了真理的蛤蟆
squatteth the toad of truth.

127
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,620
真理的蛤蟆
Toad of truth?

128
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,090
这是物理学上的名词吗
Is that a physics thing?

129
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,220
不  那是疯狂的产物
No, that's a crazy thing.

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,720
好了  谢尔顿
Okay, Sheldon.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,290
如果我们不能保证足够的快速眼动睡眠的话
What happens to our neuroreceptors

132
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,260
会对神经受体造成怎样的影响呢
when we don't get enough REM sleep?

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,570
会失去对5-羟色胺和正肾上腺素的敏感性
They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.

134
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,190
那就会引起
Which leads to...?

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,770
认知功能受损
Impaired cognitive function.

136
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,560
没错  所以进屋去  刷刷牙  上床睡觉
Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.

137
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,730
但我不想睡觉
But I don't want to go to bed.

138
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,300
我数三下  一
I'm going to count to three. One...

139
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,990
哦  好吧
Oh, all right.

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,490
你的手段真是太高明了
That was amazing how you handled him.

141
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,650
我知道怎么对付不听话的小孩
I know how to deal with stubborn children.

142
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,190
我妈以前在我家地下室办了个非法日托班
My mother used to run an illegal day care center in our basement.

143
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,800
莱纳德  你睡觉时在鬼笑吗
Leonard, you're... you're giggling in your sleep.

144
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,810
不是我笑的
It's not me.

145
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,410
是我的新手机铃声
It's my new ringtone.

146
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,270
是《蝙蝠侠》里的小丑
The Joker from Batman.

147
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,530
吓着我了
Well, it creeps me out.

148
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,150
也吓我一跳  但我花了3块钱定的
Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.

149
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,530
接电话吧还是
Just answer the phone.

150
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,600
你好
Hello.

151
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,950
我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

152
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,890
没错  他是我的室友
Yeah, yeah, he's my roommate.

153
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,850
天啊  他没事吧
Oh, God, is he okay?

154
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,930
好的  我马上过去
Yeah, all-all right. I'll be right there.

155
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,420
怎么了
What happened?

156
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,380
谢尔顿逃走了  恐怖降临了村庄
Sheldon's escaped and is terrorizing the village.

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
好吧  去吧  玩的开心点
Okay. Have fun.

158
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,640
我是霍夫斯塔德博士
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

159
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,020
-他在哪儿  -海洋球那里
- Where is he? - Ball pit.

160
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,300
真感谢你没报警
Thanks for not calling the cops.

161
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,590
没事的
Oh, hey, it's no big deal.

162
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,980
我姐姐也有个智障小孩
My sister's got a kid who's special.

163
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,630
呃  他是极品智障
ah, well, he's extra special.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,430
嘿  谢利
Hey, Shelly.

165
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,430
你干嘛呢
What you doing?

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,050
体积比错得一塌糊涂
Size ratio was all wrong.

167
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,210
我不能把它们具象化
Couldn't visualize it.

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,970
我要找更大的碳原子
Needed bigger carbon atoms.

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,620
好好好
Sure, sure.

170
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,790
你怎么进来的
How did you get into this place?

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,340
后门装了个五针脚制动系统
Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,

172
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,840
和单回路报警器  小孩子的玩意了
single-circuit alarm. Child's play.

173
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,670
我在建立碳原子模型的时候
You can start sorting protons and neutrons

174
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,600
你正好可以把质子和中子分类整理出来
while I build carbon atoms.

175
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,100
我可不这么想
No, I don't think so.

176
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,070
我们现在该回家了
We need to go home now.

177
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,390
但我还在工作
But I'm still working.

178
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,750
要是你不出来
If you don't come out of there,

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,040
我就去把你抓出来
I'm going to have to drag you out.

180
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,870
试试看啊  你永远别想抓到我
You can try, but you'll never catch me.

181
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,640
我的老天爷啊
For God's sakes.

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,850
谢尔顿  过来
Sheldon, come here!

183
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,170
抓不到俺
Bazinga.

184
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,930
我闪
Bazinga.

185
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,150
我再闪
Bazinga.

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,560
抓不到噢
Bazinga.

187
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,050
你个废废
Bazinga.

188
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,690
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

189
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,780
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

190
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,920
搞虾米鬼
What? What, what, what?

191
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,170
莱纳德  佩妮
Leonard and Penny.

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,780
干嘛
What?

193
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140
我有好消息
I have good news.

194
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,750
那也不用深更半夜冲进来
And you had to barge in here and wake us up

195
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
吓我们吧
in the middle of the night?

196
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,080
你关了手机
Your cell phone was off.

197
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,760
因为我们不想被吵到
Because we didn't want to be disturbed.

198
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,200
反正也没什么用  不是吗
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

199
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,040
谢尔顿  你到底想干嘛
Sheldon, what do you want?

200
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,360
我特来宣告  本天才找到了答案
I came to tell you I've got the answer.

201
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,370
真的吗
Really?

202
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,480
你解开石墨烯的难题了吗
You figured out the graphene problem?

203
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,370
不  那个还绝望地卡壳中
No, no, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that,

204
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,940
但我找到了解决的方法
but I figured out how to figure it out.

205
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,390
你猜怎着  莱纳德  我曾经说过
Okay, you know what, Leonard, I know I said

206
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,010
我能忍受你的室友  但我错得太离谱了
I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong.

207
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,620
我看我们还是吹了吧
We're going to have to break up.

208
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,350
你在说什么鬼
What are you talking about?

209
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,070
爱因斯坦
Einstein.

210
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,340
嗯  至少得再多说点吧
Yeah, I'm going to need a little more.

211
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,180
艾伯特·爱因斯坦
Albert Einstein.

212
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,410
继续继续
Keep going.

213
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,240
艾伯特·爱因斯坦在专利局工作时
When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity,

214
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,720
他提出了狭义相对论
he was working at the patent office.

215
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,080
那你也要去专利局工作咯
So, you're going to go work at the patent office?

216
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,600
你傻的啊
Don't be absurd.

217
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,010
那可在华盛顿
That's in Washington.

218
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,210
满大街车声嘈杂的城市我可待不了
You know I could never live in a city whose streets

219
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,100
你又不是不知道
are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.

220
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,080
其实  我是想要找一份
No. I'm going to find

221
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,820
半斤八两的低贱工作
a similarly menial job

222
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,960
只需要动用我的基底神经节就行
where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task,

223
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,590
那我的前额叶就能[高级神经活动部位]
freeing my prefrontal cortex

224
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,390
专注于解决关键问题
to work quietly in the background on my problem.

225
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,460
真是雄心壮志
Sounds like a great plan.

226
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,490
这不废话么
Of course it is.

227
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,560
就算和你讲话
Even talking to you is

228
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,920
也够低贱的咧
sufficiently menial that I can feel

229
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,290
让我不禁感觉思如泉涌啊
the proverbial juices starting to flow.

230
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,380
得  多谢分享
Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us.

231
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,450
-晚安  -不客气
- Good night.  - You're welcome.

232
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,210
你们也安安
And good night to you, too.

233
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,840
顺便  我刚观察了下你的睡相
Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment,

234
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,380
我注意到当你仰面睡觉时
and I noticed that your snoring

235
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,580
呼噜打得更响
seems to be worse when you're on your back.

236
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,480
莱纳德可从不打呼
Leonard doesn't snore.

237
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,490
我又没在说他
No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.

238
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,730
我早说了吧
Told you.

239
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,370
库珀先生  你是要找份工作吗
So, Mr. Cooper, you're looking for a job.

240
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,180
一份低贱的工作
A menial job.

241
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,790
好比你这样的
Like yours.

242
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,750
多谢提醒
Well, thank you for noticing.

243
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,430
我可是"月度低贱员工之星"呢
I'm "Menial Employee of the Month."

244
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,870
你有啥意向不
Do you have a particular field in mind?

245
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,890
当然
I do.

246
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,410
几千年来
For thousands of years,

247
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,500
最底层的人类
the lowest classes of the human race

248
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,380
在优势一族的鞭挞和压迫中
have spent their lives laboring to erect monuments

249
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,900
致力于树立起一块丰碑
under the lash of their betters,

250
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,850
直到最后 他们惨烈倒下
until finally, they dropped down

251
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,680
化作艰难跋涉之路上的一粒尘埃
and became one with the dust through which they trudged.

252
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,070
有这一类的工作吗
Do you have anything like that?

253
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,650
没
No.

254
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,580
你都不搜一下确认吗
Shouldn't you check your database?

255
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,690
就是没
No.

256
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,210
你都没打字
You didn't really type?

257
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,170
不用打也知道
I didn't really have to.

258
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,900
建筑类的如何
So, how about construction?

259
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,960
太棒了
Oh, that would be good!

260
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,590
拉拉锯子  敲敲榔头
Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail

261
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,210
和工人阶级同志们一起
as my working-class fellows and I

262
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,690
坐在城市高空的钢筋横梁上 一边趴盒饭一边摇摇欲坠
sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.

263
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,090
不  是给罗斯密市的一间住宅
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock

264
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,640
安装石膏板
at a housing project in Rosemead.

265
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,620
行啊
I could do that.

266
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,020
-很好  -就一个问题
- Good.  - One question.

267
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,140
-说  -什么是石膏板
- Yes?  - What's sheetrock?

268
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,950
过
Moving on.

269
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,810
花店快递怎么样
How about doing deliveries for a florist?

270
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,220
听起来还不错
That seems acceptable.

271
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,640
-你有车吗  -我不开车
- Do you have your own car?  - I don't drive.

272
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,370
我想也是
Of course you don't.

273
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,730
库珀先生  我就问你一个问题
Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question.

274
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,270
你上份工作是啥
What was your last job?

275
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,810
加州理工学院的高级理论粒子物理学家
Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech,

276
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,750
主要致力于M理论研究  外行人说法是弦理论
focusing on M theory, or, in layman's terms, string theory.

277
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,830
懂了
I see.

278
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,180
等我一下
Just give me a second.

279
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,950
保安  (这有疯子)
Security!

280
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,020
好的  我先把饮料送上来
Okay, I'll get those drinks started for you.

281
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,410
小心身后
Behind you.

282
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,450
谢尔顿  你这是在干嘛
Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

283
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,520
我正要去清理桌子 差点撞上你
I'm trying to get these tables cleared. We're slammed.

284
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,680
等等  等等
No, wait, wait, no, wait.

285
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,550
你在这干嘛呢
Wh-What are you doing here?

286
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
这问题还算合理
A reasonable question.

287
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,640
我问我自己
I asked myself,

288
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,040
我能想到最讨厌最沉闷的工作是什么
what is the most mind-numbing, pedeststrian job conceivable,

289
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,440
有三个答案浮现在脑中
and three answers came to mind:

290
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,760
收费站工作人员  在苹果专卖店工作的天才
uh, toll booth attendant, Apple Store genius...

291
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,050
还有佩妮的工作
...and what Penny does.

292
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,370
现在
Now...

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,630
既然我不喜欢碰别人手里的硬币
since I don't like  touching other people's coins,

294
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,980
也不想帮着抹黑"天才"这个词
and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word "Genius,"

295
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,120
所以我来了
here I am.

296
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,860
你就这么走进来  就被录用了 就这么简单
You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?

297
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,200
当然不是
Oh, heavens, no.

298
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,360
既然我不领薪水  也就不需被录用
Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired.

299
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,820
我就直接走进来  拿起个托盘 然后开始"为人民服务"
I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started "Working for the man."

300
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,110
请允许我把这个盘子收走
Let me get that plate out of your way.

301
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,200
-谢尔顿  这太荒谬了  -是吗
- Sheldon,this is ridiculous. - Is it?

302
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,070
就在刚刚  在刮掉盘子里凝结的玉米脆饼时
Just a moment ago, I had a minor epiphany

303
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,220
我突然间就顿悟了
regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon

304
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,170
聚合物降解现象
while scraping congealed nachos off a plate.

305
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,820
伯纳黛特  10号桌买单
Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.

306
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,720
谢谢  谢尔顿
Thanks, Sheldon.

307
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,730
谢尔顿  等等  再说这也不是我的工作
Sheldon,wait, this isn't even what I do.

308
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,850
我是服务生  不是勤杂工
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

309
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,380
你说得对  你的工作更低贱
You're right. That is more menial.

310
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,100
两位好  我是谢尔顿  负责这桌的服务生
Hello, I'm Sheldon. I'll be your server today.

311
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,060
不推荐点三文鱼
I don't recommend the salmon.

312
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,840
我看到它们在厨房的样子
I saw it in the kitchen.

313
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,270
好了  一份培根芝士汉堡
All right, one bacon cheeseburger,

314
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,100
同时违背两条犹太饮食禁忌
breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously--

315
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,790
光荣啊
kudos.

316
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,300
炸鱼加薯条
Beer-battered fish and chips.

317
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,330
这里你的鞑靼酱
Now, here's your tartar sauce.

318
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,610
我还帮你拿了莎莎酱
I also brought you salsa.

319
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,590
虽然有点不合常规  不过我想你会喜欢的
It's a little unconventional, but I think you'll like it.

320
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,060
味道很赞
It's zingy.

321
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,220
还有你的  招牌大玉米煎饼
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande--

322
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,890
不含芝士和酸奶油
no cheese, no sour cream,

323
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,210
不会因你的乳糖不耐症产生不良后果
no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance.

324
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,570
祝各位好胃口
Bon appetit.

325
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,330
等等
Hang on.

326
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,040
-这是黑豆  不是斑豆吧  -对
- Black beans, not pinto beans? - Yes.

327
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,270
-加双份鳄梨酱  -当然

328
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,600
-没加香菜  -没

329
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,100
-生菜是切碎的  而不是剁碎的  -对
- Lettuce shredded, not chopped? - Yep.

330
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,500
知道我为什么这么问你吗
You understand why I'm doing this to you?

331
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,950
-知道  -那就这样吧
- I do. - That'll be all.

332
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,130
这太好玩了
That was fun.

333
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
他还能在这坚持多久
How long can he keep this up?

334
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,600
听说麻省理工有位教授
I heard about this professor at MIT

335
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,880
变卖了财产  买了辆货车
who melted down, bought a van,

336
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,720
余生就做了名流动的狗狗美容师
and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.

337
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,370
就此再也没回过大学了吗
He never went back to the university?

338
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,680
除了在给项伯格教授的西施犬洗澡的时候
Only to shampoo Professor Shamburg's shitzu

339
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,920
晕
Sheesh.

340
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,090
我敢说要是我们一起集资  也能给谢尔顿买辆小货车
I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.

341
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,530
但他怕狗
But he's afraid of dogs.

342
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,290
是啊  这计划唯一的缺陷就是这个
Yeah, that's the only thing wrong with that plan.

343
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,490
各位  抱歉久等了  今天太忙了
Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped.

344
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,700
这是什么
What's this?

345
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,430
谢尔顿帮我们点的单
Sheldon took our order.

346
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,720
谢尔顿又不在这工作
Sheldon doesn't work here.

347
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,290
亲爱的  我可不是抱怨哈
Well, honey, not to complain,

348
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,590
但我们开始觉得你也不在这工作了
but we were starting to think you didn't either.

349
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,960
你们有必要这样对我吗
Is that really necessary?

350
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,780
天哪
Good Lord.

351
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,170
整个一断面的干涉图样
The interference pattern in the fracture.

352
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,260
通过分子结构的波状运动
The motion of the wave through the molecular structure.

353
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,260
我之前一直想错了
I've been looking at it all wrong.

354
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,760
不该把电子看成是粒子
I can't consider the electrons as particles.

355
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,090
他们是波状地通过石墨烯的
They move through the graphene as a wave.

356
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,910
它是波
It's a wave!

357
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,430
赶紧滴都给我喝彩啊
The moment to applaud would be now.

358
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,370
山顶洞人
Troglodytes.

359
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,340
谢尔顿  你要去哪
Sheldon... where are you going?

360
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,740
不把这清理干净吗
Aren't you going to clean this up?

361
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,540
抱歉  我又不在这工作
I'm sorry. I don't work here.

362
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,610
-这下你开心了  -我都飘飘然了
- Happy now? - I'm on a cloud.

363
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,430
一起摇摆吧
Swing me.

364
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,050
谢尔顿  快过来
Sheldon, come here.

365
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,780
我闪
Bazinga.

366
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,910
我再闪
Bazinga.

367
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,510
我瞬移
Bazinga.

368
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,040
抓不到
Bazinga.

369
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,270
就是抓不到
Bazinga!
