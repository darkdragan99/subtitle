1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,030
《阿凡达》的人物在潘多拉性交时
Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,630
会连接双方的马尾辫  可以推测
they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,220
马尾辫类似于他们的生殖器
are like their junk.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,850
那又怎样
Yeah... so?

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,020
他们骑马或骑鸟的时候
So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,390
也会用到马尾辫
they also use their ponytails.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,590
你到底想说什么
What's your point?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,480
也就是说  如果我是马或者鸟
My point is, if I were a horse or a bird,

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,230
我在詹姆斯·卡梅隆身边会相当紧张
I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,500
你对虚构情节如此着迷 实在让我费解
It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,470
现实世界中还有很多 重要的事等着你呢
when there are more important things in the real world to worry about.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,040
比如  威廉·夏特纳怎么没出演 新的《星际迷航》电影
For example, why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,410
谢尔顿 我刚走过行政办公室时
Hey, Sheldon. I was up in the administration office,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,110
无意中听到了 今年大学科学奖
and I happened to overhear the name of the winner

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,480
得奖人的名字
of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,550
你又想趁机打击我
And you want to rub my nose in the fact

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,420
我的成就又被无视了吧
that my contributions are being overlooked again?

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,120
我就是理论物理界的威廉·夏特纳
I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics.

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,520
好吧  我配合你
All right, I'll play.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,690
他们今年选了哪个 自以为是 狂妄自大的骗子
What self-important, preening fraud are they honoring this year?

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,260
我真高兴你这么问  那个人就是你
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,300
-我得奖了  -你得奖了
- I won?  - You won.

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,740
我得奖啦
I won!

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,540
太让我感到意外了
This is astonishing.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,140
不是意外得了奖  没人比我更有资格
Not that I won the award-- no one deserves it more.

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,680
其实  我说错了 根本不意外  得奖是意料中的事
Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing; more like inevitable.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,250
我不知道该先做什么 要不先通知我妈
I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,960
我知道啦  做个自访 然后放到网上去
Wait! I know-- I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,150
真替他高兴
Well, good for him.

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,060
对  理论物理界的威廉·夏特纳
Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,160
最需要的就是自我膨胀
of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
生活大爆炸第三季第十八集

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,630
那支长矛逼真得 就像要直接穿过咱的头啊
Didn't it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,100
才怪
No.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,090
你不买7-11的Slurpee[饮料名] 就没眼镜戴
Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,980
肯定又是打给我道贺的
Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,710
请静音
Uh, mute, please.

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,950
等等  火焰箭呢
Wait, wait. Hang on-- flaming arrow.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,650
喂
Hello?

40
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,490
莫顿校长  你好
Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir?

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,630
对  我在等你的电话 三年前就开始了
Yes, I was expecting your call. Three years ago.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
我明白
I see.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,170
等等  如果我不想做演讲呢
Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech?

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,840
嗯
Uh-huh.

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,470
如果我不想放弃奖项呢
And if I don't want to forfeit the award?

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,540
好  您现在是箭在弦上  不得不发
Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,610
好吧
All right.

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,210
谢谢
Thank you.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,080
有状况
Problem.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,550
咋了
What?

51
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,280
他们要我在宴会上做演讲
They expect me to give a speech at the banquet.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,890
我不会做演讲
I can't give a speech.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,790
不  你弄错了 你一直都滔滔不绝
Well, no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time.

54
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,960
你是不会闭嘴
What you can't do is shut up.

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,030
看电影前
Yeah, before the movie,

56
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,460
你说了20分钟为啥鳄梨酱变棕色了
you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown.

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,470
你说话的时候  它就变棕色了
It turned brown while you were talking.

58
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,470
我在小群体面前能自如讲话
I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups.

59
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,640
但没法在大群体面前演讲
I cannot speak to large crowds.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,150
你的大群体怎么定义
What, to you, is a large crowd?

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,650
大到能把我踩死的那种
Any group big enough to trample me to death.

62
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,050
按经验估计是36个成人或70个儿童
General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,090
谢尔顿  恭喜恭喜
Sheldon, congratulations.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
从店里给你带了芝士蛋糕
Brought you a cheesecake from work.

65
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,260
这是给你庆祝得奖的
You know, 'cause of your award,

66
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,090
不是因为小工对着它打了喷嚏
not because a busboy sneezed on it.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,930
-我不接受奖项了  -为什么
- I'm not accepting the award.  - Why not?

68
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,470
因为伟大的谢尔顿居然会怯场
Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,640
那也没有理由退出啊
That's no reason to back out.

70
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,640
我以前在高中时 得了个很大的奖
You know, I once got a pretty big honor in high school,

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,080
而我很怕面对一大群人
and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd,

72
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,280
但我挺过来了  知道吗
but I went through with it, and you know what?

73
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,180
作为玉米皇后团的成员之一
The world looked pretty darn good

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,880
坐在福特F150后面放的干草堆上
sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150

75
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,950
那是相当的风光啊
as a member of the Corn Queen's court.

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,990
谢谢
Thank you.

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,320
我会牢记在心的
Yeah, I'll bear that in mind

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,990
如果我被提名乡巴佬和平奖的话
if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,600
谢尔顿  你小题大做了
Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.

80
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
是吗
Am I?

81
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,970
我给你们讲个故事
Let me tell you a story.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,670
咱现在就需要70个儿童
Where's 70 children when you need them?

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,510
我14岁时以Summa cum laude的成绩从大学毕业
I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college.

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,850
Summa cum laude在拉丁语里是指最高荣誉
"Summa cum laude" is Latin for "with highest honors."

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,520
你要是能跳过 没人问的东西就好了
I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.

86
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,020
我要在毕业典礼上做致词
I was valedictorian and expected to give an address.

87
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,290
我到现在还记得当时
Even now, I can remember that moment

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,490
我走上讲台  看着人群
when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd.

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,490
台下数以千计的人
There must have been thousands of people.

90
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,730
我的心开始剧烈跳动
My heart started pounding in my chest.

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,300
然后开始大口呼气
I began to hyperventilate.

92
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,970
视力渐渐模糊  还没来得及...
My vision became blurry, and before I knew it...

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,940
晕啊
Oh, dear.

94
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,540
老天
Oh, my God.

95
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,610
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,170
谢尔顿  你没事吧
Sheldon, are you okay?

97
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,210
表踩我啊
Don't trample me.

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,610
拜托  妈妈
Come on, Mother.

99
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,650
你知道我为啥不接受奖项
You know why I can't accept the award.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,850
恕我直言  我不觉得祈祷会有用
With all due respect, I don't think praying will help.

101
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,960
没  我没听过那首 "主啊  请掌控这命运之轮"
No, I have not heard the song, "Jesus, Take the Wheel."

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,960
不用不用 你不需要唱给我听
No, no... You don't need to start singing it.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,160
好  我会在iTunes上下载的  妈妈
Yes, I'll buy it on the iTunes, Mother.

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,800
再见  妈妈
Good-bye, Mother.

105
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,610
各位好
Hello.

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,940
坐啊  我们想和你谈谈
Sit down. We want to talk to you.

107
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,280
我是有麻烦了吗
Am I in trouble?

108
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,180
我妈妈给你们打电话了
Did my mother call you?

109
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,580
坐就是了
Just sit.

110
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,250
我们能帮你克服怯场的问题
We think we can help you with your stage fright.

111
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,890
我深表怀疑
Oh, I doubt that.

112
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,090
我比你们智商都高 我都没想出办法呢
I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.

113
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,400
是的  可我们几个的智商加起来肯定比你高
Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.

114
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,500
不好意思 还是我高
Oh, I'm sorry. That is what I meant.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,870
好吧  你的问题是 你想孤军奋战
Okay. Your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself.

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
我们可以帮你  当你的队友
We can help you. We can be your team.

117
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,740
就像  X教授和X战警
Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.

118
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,110
我确实挺喜欢《X战警》
I do like the X-Men.

119
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,350
我看过《X战警》吗
Did I see X-Men?

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,990
看过啊  我们上周才看的 你还说你喜欢呢
Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.

121
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,720
亲爱的  说话又不用付钱
Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie.

122
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,590
怎么样啊  谢尔顿
So, how about it, Sheldon?

123
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,060
不好说
I don't know.

124
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,560
如果你们是X战警  那你们的超能力是什么
If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,400
这个  我会带你去购物 帮你选一套超赞的西装
Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit.

126
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,800
能让你更自信
Might give you more confidence.

127
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
确切来说这不叫变异  光凭这点你不可能
That's not exactly a mutation that would get you

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,380
进到X教授专为天赋异禀的年轻人开设的学校
into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters,

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,940
不过继续
but go on.

130
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,240
莱纳德
Leonard?

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,310
我可以对你进行心理分析
I thought I could try to analyze you

132
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,350
然后找出让你如此焦虑的根源
and get to the root of your anxiety.

133
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,720
你凭什么觉得你能读懂我的内心呢
What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?

134
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,280
我妈是一位杰出的精神病专家
My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist,

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,550
而且自从她指责我过于依赖母乳开始
and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,090
我就一直在接受治疗
of breast-feeding codependently.

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,430
拉杰说他可以教你
Raj says he can teach you...

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,430
什么名字来着
What did you call it?

139
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,730
我记不住  一些扯淡的印度冥想
I don't know-- some Indian meditation crap.

140
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,050
明白了 由于前三位的水准 都严重不靠谱
I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low,

141
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,440
我想你们是把最睿智的办法放到了最后
you're saving the most impressive contribution for last.

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,880
说吧  霍华德 惊我一下
Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

143
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,620
我的超能力就是我可以
My power is the ability to pretend

144
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,550
假装我很在意你这尿频尿急类的鬼问题
like I give a damn about your piddily-ass problems.

145
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,030
而且我能一直装下去  伙计
And that's 24-seven, buddy.

146
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,170
我很感激你如此做作
And I appreciate the pretense.

147
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,570
怎么样啊  谢尔顿
So, what do you say, Sheldon?

148
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,270
我们是你的X战警吗
Are we your X-Men?

149
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,470
不是
No.

150
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,870
X战警这名字来源于X教授的姓氏
The X-Men were named for the "X" in Charles Xavier.

151
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,250
既然我叫谢尔顿·库珀  那你们就是C战警(与精液谐音)
Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.

152
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,420
这名字可不怎么好听
Oh, that's not a good name.

153
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,770
好了  谢尔顿 我将引导你进行
Okay, Sheldon. I'm going to be leading you

154
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,980
一系列的冥想练习
through a series of meditation exercises.

155
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,280
这些方法是从古代印度大师那里
These methods come from the ancient gurus of India

156
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,480
传承下来的  也帮我克服了自己的恐惧
and have helped me overcome my own fears.

157
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,320
可你还是不敢和女人说话
And yet, you can't speak to women.

158
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,790
确实  不过托冥想的福  我可以和女人
True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay

159
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,280
呆在同一房间  而且不会被吓到尿裤子
in the same room with them without urinating.

160
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,960
现在  闭上双眼
Now... close your eyes.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,900
好的  不过不许打我
Okay, but don't punch me.

162
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,270
什么
What?

163
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,540
小时候  我姐姐会对我说
When I was little, my sister would say to me,

164
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,440
"闭上双眼  惊喜出现"
"Close your eyes, you'll get a surprise,"

165
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,240
然后她就会给我一拳
and then she'd punch me.

166
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,080
我不会打你的
I'm not going to punch you.

167
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,050
我姐姐以前也这么说的
That's what my sister used to say.

168
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,550
你到底还练不练了
Do you want to do this or not?

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,350
抱歉  请继续
I'm sorry. Proceed.

170
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,050
好的
All right.

171
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,890
想象你正身处一个 最有家的感觉的地方
Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home.

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,260
是哪里呢
Where is that?

173
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,230
模拟城市[一款游戏]
Sim City.

174
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,930
更确切地说  是我设计的模拟城市
More specifically, the Sim City I designed--

175
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,000
谢尔顿奥波利斯
Sheldonopolis.

176
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,470
好的  你身处谢尔顿奥波利斯
Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

177
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,200
确切的地点是哪
Where exactly?

178
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,340
谢尔顿广场  谢尔顿之塔
Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers?

179
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,010
还是人称谢尔顿勇士之家的谢尔顿运动场
Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,510
随你喜欢
Whatever you like.

181
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,280
不是说你引导我冥想吗
I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.

182
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,120
好吧  你在谢尔顿广场
Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.

183
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,320
是吗  这个季节吗
Really? This time of year?

184
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,720
那可有点冷
It's a bit nippy.

185
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,790
那就穿件毛衣
Then, put on a sweater.

186
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,720
那我可以去市中心的
Suppose I could run downtown

187
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,030
谢尔玛买一件
and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

188
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,000
随便啊  去买件毛衣就是了
Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.

189
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,330
好处就是谢尔玛是我开的
You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it,

190
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,770
所以我买东西85折
so I get a 15% discount.

191
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,440
还不都你说了算 痛快拿件毛衣就行了
You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!

192
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,640
上一季度我根本没有盈利
Look, I didn't turn a profit last quarter

193
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,640
就是因为我肆无忌惮地拿东西不给钱
by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,410
好吧
All right.

195
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,450
你买了件毛衣  现在你在谢尔顿广场
You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.

196
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,850
等等
Hang on.

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,760
是开衫的  我得扣上扣子
It's a cardigan. I have to button it.

198
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,030
不会吧
Oh, no.

199
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,190
又怎么了
What now?

200
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,230
一个类似哥斯拉的怪物正在接近城市
A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city.

201
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,570
我得把我的市民转移到安全区
I have to get my people to safety.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,770
谢尔顿奥波利斯的市民们  我是你们的市长
People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor.

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,040
跟着我
Follow me.

204
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,670
小孩子要是跑不了  就别管他们了
If the children can't run, leave them behind.

205
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,550
哎哟妈呀  模拟恐怖效果贼棒
Oh, the simulated horror!

206
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,590
拉杰
Raj?

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,960
我就知道
Just as I suspected.

208
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,600
什么冥想不过是噱头
Meditation is nothing but hokum.

209
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,710
我相当质疑你的说法
I question your premise.

210
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,950
要防止我在满屋子人面前晕倒
How is a new suit going to prevent me

211
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,250
买套新西装有个毛用了
from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,250
那会让你充满自信
It'll give you confidence.

213
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,950
只要我倍感压力时
You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out

214
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,250
我就会去买件可爱上衣
about something, I go out and buy a cute top

215
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,390
或漂漂裙裙  如此一来就会容光焕发
or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.

216
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,230
你傻的啊  难道你没意识到 你只是换了皮囊  内压犹在啊
Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person

217
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,330
穿可爱上装和漂漂裙裙有啥用
in a cute top or a fun skirt?

218
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,030
是的  所以还要买鞋子
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

219
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
我们来选选
Now, let's see what we've got.

220
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,270
这件帅气
This is nice.

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,180
这件就一个颜色
It's only one color.

222
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,540
是啊  咋了
Yeah, so?

223
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,750
就一个颜色还这么贵  岂不是亏了
That's a lot of money for only one color.

224
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
好吧
Fine.

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,620
你自己选自己喜欢的
Why don't you pick out what you like.

226
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,190
这件很犀利
This is pretty sharp.

227
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,560
不 没门儿
No. You're wrong.

228
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,670
这件够劲
This is great.

229
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,000
我六岁时也有件差不多样式的
I had a suit like this when I was six.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,980
好吧  这件绝对无可挑剔
Okay, I think we have a winner.

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,550
靠  你哪儿弄来的这件
Where the hell'd you find that?

232
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,920
舞会礼服柜台
In the prom department.

233
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,320
这也太可笑了
It's ridiculous.

234
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,260
玉米皇后团前团员没资格说这话吧
Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.

235
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,760
去试试这件再说
Please just try this one on.

236
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,660
好吧 现在不管我穿啥 和之前的相比都只能相形见拙了
Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.

237
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,010
这太荒唐了 简直像个小丑
This is absurd. I look like a clown.

238
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,610
谢尔顿
So, Sheldon...

239
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,350
你最近如何
...how you doing?

240
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,990
你就这样开始心理治疗吗
That's how you start a psychotherapy session?

241
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,320
居然问这种蠢问题
"How am I doing?"

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,820
我本来满心期待进行一场
I was promised a riverboat journey

243
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,090
对自我潜意识的探寻之旅
into the jungles of my subconscious.

244
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,990
结果呢  我都听到什么鬼问题啊
Instead, I get the same question I hear

245
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,160
拉尔夫餐厅切香肠的女招待都问得出来
from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,230
抱歉  我重来
I'm sorry, I'll start again.

247
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,370
我还是说说我的梦境吧 对你有帮助吗
Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?

248
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,370
我也不知道  也许吧
Um, I don't know, maybe.

249
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,180
我最近做了个梦 梦到我变成了巨人
I recently had a dream that I was a giant.

250
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,750
但周围的东西还是原来的比例
But everything around me was to scale,

251
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,880
所以相比之下没什么差别
so it all looked normal.

252
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,190
既然周围东西都没什么变化 你怎么知道自己变成了巨人
How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?

253
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,760
我穿着条型号为一百万的裤子
I was wearing size a million pants.

254
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
我们还是来自由谈话吧
Why don't we just talk?

255
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,540
自由谈话疗法 经典精神分析疗法  不错
The talking cure. Classical Freudian. Good choice.

256
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,540
我补充一点可能会有所帮助
If it will help speed things along,

257
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,080
我做标准罗夏墨迹测验的结果是
uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are:
（[投射测验: 猜测模糊图形以投射潜意识和内心想法]）

258
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,080
图A  蝙蝠  图B  蝙蝠 图C  蝙蝠
A) a bat, B) a bat, c) a bat,

259
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,520
图D  我爸想用皮下注射器杀死我妈
and D) my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.

260
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,720
还是我来说吧
Why don't I just start?

261
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,460
这种事时有发生 人们难以接受一项荣誉
Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades

262
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,330
那是因为在潜意识中 他们自觉不配拥有
if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them.

263
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,530
会不会你的原因也是如此呢
Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?

264
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,100
真的假的  莱纳德
Really, Leonard?

265
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,040
你是想把阿德勒学说中的
You're just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine

266
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,470
自卑情结套用在我身上吗
of the inferiority complex?

267
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,510
这连拉尔夫餐厅的女招待都知道
I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's.

268
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,950
说不定她还会白送我芝士呢
And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.

269
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,880
但这可能是问题所在
But it could be part of your problem.

270
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
我举个例子吧
Let me give you an example.

271
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,890
我8岁时
When I was eight,

272
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,090
我的一个项目  "古典音乐有助青豆生长"
I won a ribbon at the science fair

273
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,760
在科技展上得了奖  授予了我一条勋带
for my project, "Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music."

274
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,030
但我妈妈却说
But my mother pointed out

275
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,960
这和我哥哥以前的研究  "摇滚乐有害于青豆生长"
that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,930
根本没差  只不过换汤不换药
"Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock 'n' Roll."

277
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,170
我倍受打击  于是把勋带退了回去
I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.

278
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,740
你感觉如何
And how did that make you feel?

279
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,710
糟透了
Terrible.

280
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,650
对那个研究我付出了很多心血
I worked really hard on that project.

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,080
我整晚都不睡  就对着青豆芽
I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,920
唱《丑角》里的咏叹调[莱昂卡瓦洛作曲]
to a lima bean sprout.

283
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,390
继续说
Go on.

284
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,390
这又不是我的错
It wasn't my fault.

285
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,990
我不知道我哥的研究
I had never seen my brother's project.

286
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,200
我妈之前本可以告诉我
And my mother could've told me before

287
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,430
她却在颁奖典礼上当着众人面说出来
instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.

288
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,840
这么说 你很生你母亲的气咯
So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.

289
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,940
当然气  我恨死她了
Damn right, I'm angry with my mother.

290
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,120
行行好嘛  我那会儿才8岁
For God's sake, I was eight years old.

291
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,020
她却这么当众羞辱我
She humiliated me.

292
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,920
就是在那之后  我又开始尿床
That's when the bed-wetting started again.

293
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,590
多谢了  莱纳德
Thank you, Leonard.

294
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,160
谢什么啊
For what?

295
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,960
像你这样受了如此打击
If someone as damaged as you

296
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,360
还能每天早上从床上爬起来
can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning,

297
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,870
我想小小一个颁奖典礼  应该不成问题
I think I can face a simple award ceremony.

298
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,370
等等  就这样吗 不是该有一整个小时的吗
Wait, that's it? I thought we had a whole hour!

299
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,840
女士们先生们  晚上好 我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

300
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,850
很荣幸向各位隆重介绍
and it is my very great honor to introduce

301
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,750
本年度大学科学奖得主
the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science

302
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,580
我的好友谢尔顿·库珀博士
and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

303
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,890
但在此之前
But before I do,

304
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,320
请允许我先宣读下谢尔顿母亲的来信
I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother,

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,990
很遗憾她今晚未能亲临
who couldn't be here tonight.

306
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,660
很温馨了  是吧  他妈妈给他写了封信
Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter.

307
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,570
他为自己儿子感到自豪  真想知道那会是什么感觉...
She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like...

308
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,070
亲爱的谢利  她都是这么叫他的  谢利  这是个昵称
"Dear Shelly." that's what she calls him. Shelly-- it's a pet name.

309
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,610
知道我妈给我取的什么昵称吗  莱纳德
You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard.

310
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,080
我又离题了
But I digress.

311
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,150
亲爱的谢利...
"Dear Shelly..."

312
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,090
天哪
Oh, dear.

313
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,090
你怎么了
What's the matter?

314
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,290
我有点晕
I'm getting dizzy.

315
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,620
别担心
Don't worry.

316
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,430
你的C战警们(精液 semen)都守护着你
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
我做不到
I can't do this.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,360
我要晕倒了
I'm going to faint.

319
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,300
给  喝点这个  能让你放松
Here, drink this.It'll relax you.

320
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,460
酒吗
Alcohol?

321
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,270
-我不喝酒的  -好吧  那你晕吧
- I don't drink alcohol. - Fine, faint.

322
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,510
没觉得有何不同  这酒根本没用
I don't feel different.This alcohol is defective.

323
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,780
给  看这个有没有用
Here, see if this one works.

324
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,920
首先 那是完全不同的实验主题
First of all, the projects were totally different.

325
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,090
我的实验证明  培植青豆时  给它们放古典乐
I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans

326
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,460
能促进它们生长  但我妈根本不听我的
and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me.

327
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,300
想知道精心培育能不能促进成长吗
If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth,

328
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,660
我想郑重指出  我哥哥比我高了整整八英寸[20cm]
I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.

329
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
我准备好了
I'm ready.

330
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,440
对了
right.

331
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,210
女士们先生们  欢迎我们的贵宾  谢尔顿·库珀博士
Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

332
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,510
谢了小矮人  下面我接手就行了
Thanks, shorty, I'll take it from here.

333
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,250
好了  大家准备好来点乐子了吗
All right, you people ready to have some fun?

334
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,850
你们都对微积分有基本认识
You have a basic understanding of differential calculus

335
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,050
并至少学过一年代数拓扑吧
and at least one year of algebraic topology?

336
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,990
好吧  下面是笑话时间
Well, then here come the jokes.

337
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,260
（[一个单侧曲面  "科学松鼠会"有过详细介绍]）
鸡为什么要穿过默比乌斯带
Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip?

338
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
为了回到同一侧  逗你玩呢
To get to the same side-- bazinga!

339
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,600
还有  一个中子走进家酒吧问道 酒多少钱一杯
All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, "How much for a drink?"

340
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,740
酒保回答  你买吗  免费(无电荷)
The bartender says, "For you, no charge."

341
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,710
有人在吗
Hello?

342
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,710
我知道你们在的
I know you're out there.

343
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,050
能听到你们代谢氧气  排出二氧化碳的声音
I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.

344
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,190
观众中好像不乏学术权威啊
Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience.

345
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,820
地质学系的兰德尔教授
Dr. Randall from the geology department--

346
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,560
（[跟take for granted谐音]）
唯一一位别人说他(研究花岗岩)"花岗岩脑袋"  他还得笑纳的人
only man who's happy when they take his work for granite.

347
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,730
巴扎嘿
Ba-da cha!

348
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,400
当然  我是在拿地质学家开涮
I kid the geologists, of course,

349
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,740
那只是因为我压根就没把那当回事儿
but it's only 'cause I have no respect for the field.

350
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,010
下面我们来谈点严肃话题
Let's get serious for a moment.

351
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,110
我们今天为何齐聚于此
Why are we all here?

352
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,010
因为我们是科学家
'Cause we're scientists.

353
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,950
科学家是研究什么的
And what do scientists study?

354
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,690
宇宙
The universe.

355
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,850
宇宙由何构成
And what's the universe made of?

356
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,390
很高兴你提这问题
I am so glad you asked.

357
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,430
有锑  砷  铝  硒
There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium
（[The Element's Song 化学元素周期表歌]）

358
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,700
有氢  氧  氮  铼
And hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium

359
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,230
还有镍  钕  镎  锗
And nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium

360
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,330
一起唱
Everybody!

361
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,340
还有铁  镅
And iron, americium

362
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,240
钌  铀  铕  锆
Ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium,

363
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,770
镥  钒
Lutetium, vanadium

364
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,770
亚洲人唱
Just the Asians!

365
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,580
还有镧和锇
And lanthanum and osmium

366
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,280
砹和镭
And astatine and radium...

367
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,830
佩妮  莱纳德
Penny, Leonard.

368
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,300
你们能不能帮我答疑解惑
Would you be able to answer some questions

369
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,500
昨天晚上我到底怎么回事
I'm having about the events of last night?

370
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,140
当然
Sure.

371
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,270
问题一
Question one...

372
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,280
我的裤子上哪去了
where are my pants?

373
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,780
你可以上YouTube看一下
You might want to check YouTube.

374
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,150
怎么找
What do I search?

375
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,850
已经缓冲好了  直接点开看吧
It's already loaded. Just hit play.

376
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,660
好了各位  让我们来聊聊数学吧
All right, people, let's get down to the math.

377
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,360
仅仅用三维的思考方式  会限制我们的想象力
It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination.

378
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,730
我能从头上脱了裤子吗
Can I take my pants off over my head?

379
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,030
当然不行
Of course not.

380
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,600
还有我身体挡着的  [视频名：物理学家斯文扫地]
My body's in the way.

381
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,810
但只要能进入更高维度
But if we had access to higher dimensions,

382
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,680
就能通过第四维度
we could move our pants around our bodies

383
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,910
让裤子绕着身体转圈
through the fourth dimension

384
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,920
以后就再没脱裤子这么一说了
and our days of dropping trousers would be over.

385
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
天哪
Oh, Lord...

386
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,660
真是丢人丢到家了
This couldn't be any more humiliating.

387
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,760
还没完呢
Give it a minute.

388
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,730
现在  在座的各位天文学家们
Now, for the astronomers in the audience,

389
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,620
准备好看看月亮背面吧
get ready to see the dark side of the moon.

390
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,810
还有天王星在此[Uranus 谐音your anus菊花]
And here's Uranus.
