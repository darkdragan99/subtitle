1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,190
每次看到格林奇的心脏[出自影片《圣诞怪杰》]
Oh, I always tear up

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,420
涨大三倍的时候  我都止不住要流泪
When the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,450
流泪是应该的
Tears seem appropriate.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,120
心肌的扩张
Enlargement of the heart muscle,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,490
或是肥大型心肌病  都是重病
Or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,550
会引起充血性心力衰竭
which could lead to congestive heart failure.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,090
你不喜欢他是吧  谢尔顿
You really didn't like it, Sheldon?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,590
不  正相反
No, on the contrary.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,090
我认为格林奇是个体贴又迷人的角色
I found the Grinch to be a relatable,engaging character.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,750
而且我十分赞赏
And I was really with him right up to the point

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,450
他屈从于社会习俗
that he succumbed to social convention

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,450
回赠礼物  拯救了圣诞节的行为
And returned the presents and saved Christmas.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,590
多么扫兴啊
What a buzz kill that was.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,450
我们看《圣诞雪人》的时候  他赞成出太阳
When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,090
请注意
Excuse me,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,850
太阳是万物之必需
But the sun is essential for all life on Earth.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,220
而圣诞雪人只是一个
Frosty is merely

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,620
冰雪构成的怪物  瞬息即逝  还戴着偷来的帽子
A bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,720
那是犯罪  而且居然从没有人为此指责他
A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
生活大爆炸第三季第十一集

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,430
我超爱装饰圣诞树
I just love decorating the Christmas tree.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
感觉自己又回到了小时候
It makes me feel like a little girl again.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,530
我小时候家里没有圣诞树
We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,060
真的吗  为什么
Really? Why not?

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,900
在我家
Mmm, in my family,

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,230
节日通常是用来研究人类社会中
Holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,730
它们起到的人类学和心理学意义
For their anthropological and psychological implications

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,060
而不是用来庆祝的
On human society.

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,060
真有节日气氛
Oh, sounds festive.

30
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,700
那你们总会互赠礼物吧
Did you at least give presents?

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,460
某种程度上
Mmm, in a way.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,530
我们互赠研究论文
We presented papers.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,230
然后分小组讨论  再相互评论
And then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,460
谢尔顿  你呢
Sheldon, what about you?

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,900
你家有圣诞树吗
Did you have a Christmas tree?

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,230
当然有
Oh, yes.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,760
有圣诞树  有马槽
We had a tree, we had a manger,

38
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,430
草坪上还有一个充气圣诞老人
We had an inflatable Santa Claus

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,760
身前站着一只塑料驯鹿
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,350
为了增添欢乐气氛
And to make things even more jolly,

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,700
房子的周围还有一闪一闪的灯光
there were so many blinking lights on the house

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,360
引得周围邻居纷纷来偷
They induced neighborhood-wide seizures.

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,260
所以我猜你不想帮我们装饰圣诞树咯
So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,460
不想
I do not.

45
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,960
但如果你坚持
But if you insist

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,430
把一个爬满蜘蛛的的易燃物放在我家
on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,930
我要求你把这个加上
I would request that you add this.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,260
那是什么
What is it?

49
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,930
你是在开玩笑吗
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,900
这是牛顿爵士的半身像
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

51
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,160
没错  是的
Oh, sure, sure.

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,430
很有圣诞气息
Very Christmasy.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,360
不  应该是比你挂在那棵树上的
Wait, excuse me, but it's much

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,930
其他东西都更有圣诞气息
more "Christmasy" than anything you've put on the tree.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,930
又开始了
Here we go.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,430
公历1642年12月25日
December 25, 1642,Julian calendar,

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,030
艾萨克·牛顿爵士诞生
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
而另一方面  耶稣其实夏天出生的
Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,030
他的生日被改到了
His birthday was moved

60
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,030
和异教徒某个传统节日的同一天
to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,860
那一天本该要点起篝火
that celebrated the winter solstice

62
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,630
屠宰山羊  庆祝冬至
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

63
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,260
老实说
Which, frankly,

64
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,730
那会比和我妈妈在教堂待上12小时
sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,230
然后回来吃水果蛋糕要有趣得多
followed by a fruitcake.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,860
祝大家"牛诞快乐"
Merry Newton-mas, everyone.

67
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,860
虽然说不上原因  但我觉得你这祝福并不真诚
I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.

68
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,700
没事的  牛顿爵士可以
No, it's fine. Look, Sir Issac can go

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,130
跟这个拐杖糖挂在一起
right next to this little candy cane.

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,960
不行  牛顿要放在树的顶端
No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

71
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,730
不  不行
No, he doesn't.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
我明白
I understand.

73
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,860
你是因为牛顿声称  是他发明了微积分而抵触他
You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus

74
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,900
你想要把莱布尼茨[德数学家]挂在树顶
and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,100
没错  被你发现了
Yeah, you got me.

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,430
我支持莱布尼茨
I'm a Leibniz man.

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,260
也许等你妈妈来了之后
Well, perhaps when your mother gets here,

78
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,800
她能启发你清醒一点
she'll talk some sense into you.

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,000
什么
What?

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,600
你妈妈要来  什么时候
Your-your mother's coming? When?

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,600
明天
Tomorrow.

82
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,360
那你打算什么时候告诉我
When were you going to tell me?

83
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,530
明天吧
Um... tomorrow?

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,130
你为什么要对我保密
Why were you keeping this a secret?

85
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
我只是  只是想
Well, I just-- I thought...

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,200
我能打断一下吗
If I can interject here,

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,030
很显然  莱纳德是担心
Obviously Leonard is concerned

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,430
怕他妈妈不会赞成你做他的伴侣
that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,260
为什么她会不赞成
Why wouldn't she approve of me?

90
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,900
我很招人喜欢啊
I'm adorable.

91
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,730
你确实是  只是
You are, it's just...

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,230
我能再打断一下吗
If I can interject again.

93
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,900
莱纳德的家人都很优秀  成绩斐然
Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family,

94
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,930
他们选择的伴侣也都很优秀
who have all chosen high-achieving partners.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,560
他可能是觉得
He probably feels

96
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,360
他妈妈很难认同
that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed

97
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,200
他跟一个  生平最高成就
with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement

98
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,130
就是背下芝士蛋糕工厂菜单的女人约会
is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,330
那可是份很长的菜单
Hey, it's a big menu.

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,500
光甜点就有两页
There's two pages just for desserts.

101
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,730
我知道
I know.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,930
还有每天一换的当日特餐
And those specials-- they change every day.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
好吧  我自己说起来就够废了
Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it.

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,430
-你还添油加醋就更差了  -好吧
- It's just ridiculous when you pile on. - Okay.

105
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,760
抱歉
Sorry.

106
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,760
你跟她说我们在交往  她是怎么说的
So what did she say when you told her we were going out?

107
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,960
嗯...
Um...

108
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,330
你没告诉她我们在交往  是吧
You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?

109
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,460
嗯...
Um...

110
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,960
为什么不告诉她
Why not?

111
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,300
-嗯...  -莱纳德
- Um... - Leonard...

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,900
冥想我并不擅长
I'm no expert on meditation,

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,530
但如果你想要冷静下来
but if you're trying to calm yourself down,

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,300
我想最好说"唵"[印度教咒语]
I believe the word is "Om."

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,060
你远道来机场接我
It was so nice of you

116
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,100
真是太贴心了
to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,460
这没什么的
No trouble at all.

118
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,530
是我开的车  妈妈
I drove, Mother.

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,660
现在也是我在开
I'm driving now.

120
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,200
没错  宝贝  你真是妈妈的骄傲
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,130
我一直很想感谢你
I've been meaning to thank you

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,360
为我的论文加的注解
for your notes on my paper

123
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,930
证明了量子脑动力学理论的荒谬
disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,130
我很荣幸
My pleasure.

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
作为非物理学家
For a non-physicist,

126
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
您对大脑水分子中的电偶极子
you have a remarkable grasp

127
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,030
难以形成玻色凝聚物的原因
of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules

128
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,830
理解得非常到位
could not possibly form a Bose condensate.

129
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

130
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,200
你什么时候给我妈论文加的注解
When did you send my mom notes on a paper?

131
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
8月16日
August 16.

132
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,260
就在她做完腕管综合症手术之后
Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.

133
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,330
-我谢过你送的花了吗  -谢过了
- Oh, did I thank you for the flowers? - You did.

134
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,030
其实我并不喜欢花
I don't really like flowers.

135
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
我也不喜欢  但那是社会习俗
Neither do I, but it's the social convention.

136
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,160
是啊  没错
It is, isn't it?

137
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,160
等等  你动过手术
Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

138
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,000
是的  谢尔顿还送了花
Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.

139
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,330
我听到了
No, I heard that.

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
那你还"等等"什么
Then what was all that "wait, wait, wait" about?

141
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,660
我只是没搞明白
I just don't understand

142
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,500
他怎么比我还了解你的生活
why he knows more about your life than I do.

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,130
我认为是由于我和谢尔顿
Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon

144
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
因共同的兴趣和对彼此的尊重而时常联系
and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect,

145
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,760
而你却因你那
while you avoid me,

146
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,230
无法释怀的童年阴影  总是躲着我
due to unresolved childhood issues.

147
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,560
我们认为正是这一点
It's what we think

148
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,960
引起了你的自恋型人格障碍
caused your narcissistic personality disorder.

149
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,360
我们上次视频聊天时详细地探讨了这个问题
We discussed it at length during our last video chat.

150
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,560
虽然不知道为什么会提到你
Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.

151
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,900
没错  既然我们又提到了
Yes, but we are on the subject,

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,600
所以我不得不问一下
so I'm obliged to ask.

153
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,930
莱纳德  最近过得怎样
Leonard, how are you?

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,360
挺好  妈妈  你呢
Fine, Mom. How are you?

155
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,730
我绝经了
Mmm, menopausal.

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,360
现在我不怎么好了
Now I'm less fine.

157
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,260
你弟弟订婚了  你听说了吗
Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?

158
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,760
没
No.

159
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,760
谢尔顿  你给我讲讲吧
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

160
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,600
是我的错
My bad.

161
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,200
不过我代表我们两人送了礼
I did send a gift from both of us.

162
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,000
她是个出众的女孩子
She's a remarkable girl.

163
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,000
新泽西州最年轻的上诉法院法官
The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,530
还两次获得奥运会铜牌
and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist.

165
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,560
那你肯定非常高兴
You must be very happy.

166
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,360
为什么  又不是我要娶她
Why? I'm not marrying her.

167
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,160
你最近怎么样
So, how about you?

168
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,900
跟什么有趣的人在交往吗
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

169
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
我不确定她是不是有趣  不过...
Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but...

170
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,860
谢尔顿  还不是时候
Not the time, Sheldon.

171
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,060
好吧
Very well.

172
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,760
我们更换话题
Shall we switch topics

173
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,800
谈谈牛顿或莱布尼茨吧[两人曾先后独立发明微积分]
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,630
没事的  谢尔顿
It's all right, Sheldon.

175
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,830
我会假装
I will just pretend

176
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,730
莱纳德没叫你瞒着我
that Leonard's not withholding information.

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,400
虽然我仍要指出  莱纳德
Although, I will point out, Leonard,

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,430
我是名训练有素的精神病学家
that I am a trained psychiatrist

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,260
你现在这偷偷摸摸欲盖弥彰的举动
and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics

180
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,530
跟你小时候学着手淫那会没什么两样
that accompanied your learning to masturbate.

181
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,500
莱纳德  她太了不起了
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,200
我真羡慕你
How I envy you.

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
霍华德
So, Howard,

184
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,830
你跟拉杰  终于鼓起了勇气
have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage

185
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,130
向彼此表白了你们潜在的同性恋情结吗
to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,530
什么  没有
What? No.

187
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,960
为什么没有
Why not?

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
因为我们彼此之间  并没有
Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings

189
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,360
潜在的同性恋情结
toward one another.

190
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,360
我明白了
I see.

191
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
不  我说真的
No, really.

192
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,030
我现在有女朋友了
I have a girlfriend now.

193
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,460
那她今晚在哪呢
And where is she this evening?

194
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,130
她有事出了城
She had to go out of town.

195
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,630
她祖母去世了
Her grandmother died.

196
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,730
我明白了
I see.

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,160
她祖母去世了
Her grandmother died.

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,230
我说真的
Honest to God.

199
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,400
莱纳德  告诉她我有女朋友了
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

200
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,300
你什么意思  不懂我在说什么
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?

202
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
告诉她我有女朋友了
Tell her I have a girlfriend!

203
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,730
好吧
All right.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,730
他"有女朋友了"
He "has" a "girlfriend."

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,330
她叫伯纳黛特  也在当女侍应
Her name is Bernadette. She's working as a waitress,

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,700
不过还同时上学  想成为微生物学家
but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.

207
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
霍华德  记住  你越是执着于
Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately

208
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,730
坚持这样的想法
you stick to this construct,

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,130
对你同伴的伤害  也就越大
the more you're hurting your partner.

210
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,460
你真以为对着我耳朵这么讲话有用吗
Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?

211
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,760
抱歉我来晚了
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

212
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,200
很高兴你来了  坐
Oh, glad you're here. Uh, sit down.

213
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,230
我去给你拿个碟子
I'll get you a plate.

214
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,560
妈  记得佩妮吧
Mom, you remember Penny.

215
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,430
当然  那个有着无法释怀的恋父情结的
Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress

216
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,660
女招待兼女演员
with the unresolved father issues.

217
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,930
他最终正视到
Has he finally come to terms

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,930
他家的小小击球手  胸部渐隆了吗
with his little slugger growing breasts?

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,960
他送了我个足球和棒球手套做圣诞礼物
Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas,

220
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,300
所以我想还是没有吧
So I'm going to say no.

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
如果这算安慰  我们都很垂涎你的丰胸
If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.

222
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,400
典型的过度代偿行为
Classic overcompensation.

223
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,400
说到父亲  莱纳德
Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,

224
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,430
我想起来了  我和你爸离婚了
That reminds me, I'm divorcing your father.

225
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,630
什么
What?!

226
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,030
他背着我出轨
Yes. He was cheating on me.

227
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,030
-不是吧  -就是  和一个什么
- No!  - Yes, with some waitress

228
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,660
大学餐厅里的女招待
From the university cafeteria.

229
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,860
难以置信吧
Can you believe it?

230
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,900
居然和一个女招待
A waitress?

231
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
无意冒犯  亲爱的
Oh, no offense, dear.

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,430
没事  不知怎的听起来更像称赞
No, it sounded like a compliment.

233
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,000
什么时候的事情
When did this happen?

234
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,300
让我想想
Mmm, well, let's see.

235
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,960
谢尔顿  我什么时候和他离婚的
Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
9月22日
September 22.

237
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,460
对了  想起来了
Oh, yes, that's right.

238
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,800
就在莱纳德的狗狗死后一周
The weekend after Leonard's dog died.

239
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
米琪死了吗
Mitzy's dead?!

240
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,400
她已经又老又瞎了  莱纳德
She was old and blind, Leonard.

241
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,230
我们也无能为力
What choice did we have?

242
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,360
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

243
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,000
为什么我是最后一个知道的
Why am I the last to know?!

244
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,160
不好意思  莱纳德  离婚的是我
Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce,

245
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,560
死的是米琪
Mitzy is the one who is dead.

246
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,800
你这么大惊小怪干嘛
Why are you the one making a fuss?

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,060
好吧
You're right.

248
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,100
我真是抱歉
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

249
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
过分的是我行了吧
I'm way out of line!

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,430
佩妮  你有什么新鲜事儿吗
So, Penny, what's new in your life?

251
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,460
没
Nothing.

252
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,200
鬼都没有
Not a damn thing.

253
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,840
谢谢你开车送我回酒店
Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.

254
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,340
没事儿
Oh, it's not a problem.

255
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
我本想让莱纳德送我
I was going to ask Leonard to do it,

256
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,700
但他似乎有点情绪波动
But he seemed a bit emotionally unstable

257
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,000
这样的人可不能操纵重型机械
And you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.

258
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,940
没错  我同意
No, you do not.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
你车上的"检查引擎"提示灯亮了
Your "check engine" light is on.

260
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,240
是啊  我真该贴张贴纸上去
Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that.

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
离婚一定让你感到伤心欲绝吧
So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.

262
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,340
一点也不
Oh, not at all.

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,370
倒是坐在一辆不进行例行维护的汽车里
But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle

264
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
让我感到有些焦虑
That's not subjected to regular maintenance.

265
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,440
等等  你的婚姻终结了
Come on, I mean, you're not upset

266
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,870
你却一点不难过吗
that your marriage is over?

267
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,220
一开始  我感到类似悲伤
Well, initially I felt something akin to grief

268
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,500
或近似生气的情绪
And perhaps anger,

269
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,600
但是在那不要脸的狗杂种背叛我之后
But that's the natural reaction of the limbic system

270
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,500
大脑边缘系统的自然反应
To being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.

271
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,540
很有理
Sure, sure.

272
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,770
但好在我已经8年没和他发生性关系了
Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact

273
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,300
这也多少减轻了打击程度
That I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.

274
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,140
居然有八年
Eight years?

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,670
这没什么
Oh, that's nothing.

276
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,140
自1982年来  性高潮问题都是我自行解决
I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.

277
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,070
欧耶
Yikes.

278
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,640
笑什么
What's so funny?

279
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,400
我性高潮时都用这个词儿  "欧耶"
That's exactly what I say during orgasms: "Yikes."

280
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,900
我现在真想喝一杯
You know what? I could use a drink.

281
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,400
顺道去喝一杯吗
Do you want to stop for a drink?

282
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,770
-我不喝酒  -有我教你呢
- Oh, I don't drink.  - I do, I'll teach you.

283
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,870
莱纳德
Leonard?

284
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,300
莱纳德
Leonard?

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,970
莱纳德
Leonard...?

286
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,100
干嘛
What is it?

287
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,240
我泡了茶
I made tea.

288
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,740
我不想喝茶
I don't want tea.

289
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,700
又不是泡给你喝的
I didn't make tea for you.

290
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,500
这是我的茶
This is my tea.

291
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,870
那你告诉我干嘛
Then why are you telling me?

292
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,500
这算是开场白
It's a conversation starter.

293
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,700
这开场白烂透了
That's a lousy conversation starter.

294
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,170
是吗  我们不是开始聊天了吗
Oh, is it? We're conversing.

295
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,740
将军  你输了
Checkmate.

296
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,340
你到底想要干嘛  谢尔顿
What do you want, Sheldon?

297
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
我想要从企业号星舰飞船上
What I want is to be departing the starship Enterprise

298
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,140
乘坐单人穿梭机前往由我统治的星球
In a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule

299
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,540
著名的谢尔顿阿尔法5号星球
Known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

300
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,070
这我也想
I want that too.

301
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,500
我问你来这里干嘛
Why are you here?

302
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,440
当然是来安慰你
To comfort you, of course.

303
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
哦不  这个位置一点也不好
No, that's not going to work at all.

304
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,740
我还是到那边去安慰你吧
I'll comfort you from over here.

305
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,500
莱纳德  你现在的心理状态
Leonard, what you're experiencing

306
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,800
是典型的荣格主义危机[著名瑞士心理学家]
Is a classic Jungian crisis

307
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,170
个体随着年龄的增长会哀悼
In which the aging individual mourns the loss

308
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,200
不可能实现的理想家庭成员的缺失
Of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.

309
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,840
多谢  真是倍感安慰
Thank you, that's very comforting.

310
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
我还没说到安慰部分呢
That's not the comforting part.

311
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,700
还没说到啊
It's not?

312
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,940
当然
No, no.

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,440
安慰部分是  对于你现在的感受
The comforting part is that the Germans

314
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,470
德国人提出了一个专业术语
Have a term for what you're feeling.

315
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,900
悲观主义
Weltschmerz.

316
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,600
意思是
It means

317
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,900
由假设与理想世界和现实世界之间
the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is

318
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,440
比较产生的落差从而导致的抑郁情绪
To a hypothetical, idealized world.

319
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,070
果不其然  我还真好受点了
You're right, I do feel better.

320
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,940
德国人在安慰方面还真有一套
Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people.

321
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,900
莱纳德  只要记住  即使你的亲生家人
Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family

322
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,270
有负于你  至少你还有我  你的替代家人
Has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.

323
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,340
你是我的替代家人
You're my surrogate family?

324
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,240
如果这算是安慰  我也没什么好高兴的
If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either.

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,640
晚安
Good night.

326
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,570
好了  这次来试试一口闷
Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.

327
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,940
欧耶
Yikes.

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,670
自2003年起  我就自行解决酒后兴奋的问题
I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003.

329
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,740
给我和我闺蜜再满上
Another round for me and my homegirl.

330
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,200
我感到一阵暖意扩散到四肢
I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.

331
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
只要别暖到让你
As long as you don't feel it

332
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,030
想脱裤子  就准没事
Running down your pants, you're fine.

333
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,230
这一下太猛了
Oh, that is fascinating.

334
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,870
我感觉自己一下就没了矜持
I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions.

335
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,030
比如说
For example,

336
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,900
我很认真地考虑起  去叫那打杂的
I'm seriously considering asking that busboy

337
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,130
让我边吃着芝士蛋糕  边在后巷强奸我
To ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake.

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,070
你怎么想
What do you think?

339
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,930
我们的芝士蛋糕很出名
Well, we are known for our cheesecake.

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,030
-给我们再来一杯  -对
- Hit us again.  - Yes.

341
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,830
如果喝一点感觉就这么爽  再喝一定更爽
If a little is good, more must be better.

342
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,530
-贝芙  你猜怎么着  -什么
- Hey, Bev, guess what?  - What?

343
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,530
我跟你儿子上床了
I'm sleeping with your son.

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,700
真的  哪个儿子
Really? Which one?

345
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,130
就是住在我家对面的那个
The one from whom I live across the hall... from.

346
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,300
那倒是很方便
Well, that's convenient.

347
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,230
他的小弟弟咋样
How did his penis turn out?

348
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,930
贝芙丽  我可不想跟我男友的母亲
Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother

349
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,530
-讨论他的小弟弟  -有道理
- About his penis.  - Oh, fair enough.

350
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
那你对那打杂的
What can you tell me, if anything,

351
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,630
他的小弟弟  有何见解
About that busboy's penis?

352
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,700
其实  我只吃过芝士蛋糕
Actually, I've only had the cheesecake.

353
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,630
再来一杯
One more time.

354
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,100
莱纳德不想告诉你我俩在交往
You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.

355
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,400
真的
Really?

356
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,100
这要不就意味着
Well, that means he's either

357
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,500
他对你们的关系感到尴尬
Embarrassed about the relationship

358
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,530
要不就是他不怎么在乎他老妈
Or he doesn't care enough about his mother

359
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,230
不想告诉她  他在跟人交往
To tell her he's in one.

360
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,330
不管是哪个原因  我俩总有个人受辱
Either way, one of us should be insulted.

361
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,270
咱去证实下  到底是谁受辱
Well, let's go find out who.

362
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,770
你先去拦辆出租
You go get a taxi.

363
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,930
我得去往那打杂的屁股兜里
I'm gonna slip my business card

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
塞张我的名片
Into that busboy's back pocket,

365
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,170
扯起他的制服  塞他右半边屁股兜里
Cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.

366
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,170
莱纳德
Leonard...?

367
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,670
小宝贝
Sonny boy!

368
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,800
快出来
Get out here!

369
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,170
你妈咪想跟你谈谈
Your mommy wants to talk to you!

370
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,830
到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

371
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,270
你麻烦大了
You're in trouble.

372
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,000
你干嘛不告诉我  你在追我的闺蜜
Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?

373
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,470
我这样说对吗
Did I say that right?

374
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,500
对  不错  很不错
Yeah, not bad, not bad.

375
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,270
你们俩喝醉了吗
Are you guys drunk?

376
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,600
我倒想的
Well, I hope so.

377
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,900
不然  我们干嘛停在Del Taco[著名快餐店]
Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco?

378
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,930
你怎么能不告诉我
Now, how could you not tell me

379
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,300
你在跟这么个可爱迷人的姑娘
You were in a relationship

380
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,770
谈恋爱呢
With this lovely, charming young woman?

381
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,030
-多谢夸奖  -不客气
- Oh, thank you.  - You're welcome.

382
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
是因为她没啥文化
Is it because she's uneducated,

383
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,170
又做的是低贱的服务生吗
Trapped in a menial service position?

384
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,330
你不是才说我可爱又迷人吗
What the hell happened to "lovely and charming"?

385
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,130
你怎么能不告诉我
How come you didn't tell me

386
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,300
你和爸离婚了
That you and Father were getting a divorce?

387
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,970
怎么能不告诉我  你动过手术
How come you didn't tell me you had surgery?

388
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,370
怎么能不告诉我  我的狗狗死了
How come you didn't tell me my dog died?

389
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,530
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

390
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,800
我知道你的意思了
What I hear you saying

391
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,170
你是想要更亲密的母子关系
Is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.

392
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,330
是的
I do.

393
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,300
好了  很晚了
There. It's late.

394
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,600
现在  上床睡觉去
Now, go to bed.

395
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,170
我感到一阵暖意  扩散到心头
I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.

396
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,070
那是因为Del Taco[快餐店名]
That's the Del Taco.

397
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,630
为什么莱纳德在用他的头
Why is Leonard softly banging his head

398
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,770
轻撞他卧室的门
Against his bedroom door?

399
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,670
说起暖意  过来
Speaking of warm feelings-- come here.

400
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,370
还不如去吻那打杂的呢
Now I'd rather have the busboy.

401
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,160
谢谢你送我去机场
Thank you for taking me to the airport.

402
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,800
不客气
You're very welcome.

403
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,900
我再次重申  是我在开车
Once again, I'm driving.

404
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,230
而且我就在这儿呢
I'm right here.

405
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,760
拜托  我宿醉未醒够难受了
Please, I am very hungover

406
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,430
没心情照顾到你想被肯定的心情
And in no mood to satisfy your need for approval.

407
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,400
谢尔顿  我真心希望你能谅解
Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me

408
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,630
谅解我昨晚的不当之举
For my inappropriate behavior last night.

409
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,760
我并不怪你
I don't blame you.

410
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,330
你只是喝醉了
You were intoxicated.

411
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,700
谢谢
Thank you.

412
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
我怪的是佩妮
I blame Penny.

413
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,200
我也怪佩妮
I blame Penny, too.

414
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,960
佩妮真坏
Bad Penny.

415
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,330
等等  你们在说什么
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

416

什么不当之举
What inappropriate behavior?

417
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,830
我想你最好不要知道

418
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,760
-我同意  -同意

你跟我之间交流不够吗
That you don't communicate with me enough?

427
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,960
