1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,090
粉色指甲油
Okay, Babydoll Pink,

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,120
看看你能不能把我爸遗传的大脚遮小点
let's see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad's feet.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,970
谢尔顿  就两度
It's just two degrees, Sheldon.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,050
我只想把恒温器调高两度
I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,910
让我像你指出  两度
Let me point out that two degrees

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,380
可以是水和蒸汽的差异
can be the difference between water and steam.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,460
我们又不是住在茶壶里
Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,420
你在室友协议中同意了这个温度
This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,620
去你的室友协议
Aw, screw the roommate agreement!

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,560
不许你鄙视室友协议
No, you don't screw the roommate agreement.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,570
室友协议鄙视你
The roommate agreement screws you.

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,040
跟你的恒温器下地狱去吧
You know what, go to hell and set their thermostat.

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,350
我根本不用下地狱
I don't have to go to hell.

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,230
调成73度  我已经在地狱了
At 73 degrees, I'm there already!

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,930
谁啊
Who is it?

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,320
莱纳德
Leonard.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,200
等等
Hang on.

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,190
我今晚能睡你沙发上吗
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,620
可以
Uh, well, you can try,

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,940
不过对门的人一直很吵
but the people across the hall are being very noisy.

21
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,040
你听到了吧
You heard that, huh?

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,020
显然  一个想调恒温器
Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat,

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,480
另一个又发疯了
then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.

24
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,050
你也觉得他是疯子吧
So you agree, he's nuts.

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,850
没会和他合租的人那么疯
Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,520
信不信由你  我刚认识他时他更疯
Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,040
我才不信呢
Oh, I do not believe that.

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,840
你太傻太天真了
You are so naive.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,510
就像七年前的我
Just like I was seven years ago.

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,880
我刚开始在大学工作
I'd just started at the university.

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,650
请问  谢尔顿·库珀家在哪
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

32
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,380
你是来看房的吧
Oh, I bet you're here to check out the room for rent.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,090
-对  -兄弟  快跑
- Yeah.  - Run away, dude.

34
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,060
什么
What?!

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,570
跑快点  跑远点
Run fast, run far.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,310
那应该是第一条线索
That should have been my first clue.

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,210
生活大爆炸第三季第二十二集

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,570
谢尔顿的前室友要你赶紧逃跑
So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,350
我当时只觉得他是个疯子
For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,420
他的样子很像疯子
He had this really deranged look.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,080
跟谢尔顿住能不疯吗
Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,200
现在明白也太迟啦
Sure, it makes sense now.

43
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,010
接着  我上楼敲门
Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,670
有事吗
Yeah?

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,220
你是库珀博士吗
Dr. Cooper?

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,030
你找的是对门的疯子
No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,190
回想起来  那是第二条线索
In retrospect, that was clue number two.

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,870
有事吗
Yes?

49
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,260
我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

50
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,010
我打过电话想看房  你说...
I called you about the apartment. You said...

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,960
我知道我说了什么
I know what I said.

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,860
我也知道你说了什么
I know what you said.

53
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,640
我还知道我妈在1992年3月5日说了什么
I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
第六惰性气体是什么
What is the sixth noble gas?

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,750
-什么  -你说你是科学家
- What?  - You said you're a scientist.

56
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,810
第六惰性气体是什么
What is the sixth noble gas?

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,830
氡?
Uh, radon?

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,130
你是问我还是回答我
Are you asking me or telling me?

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,220
回答你?
Telling you?

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,730
回答你
Telling you.

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,220
好  下一个问题
All right, next question.

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,480
柯克还是皮卡尔
Kirk or Picard?
[星际迷航中初代和下一代进取号的舰长]

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,410
好难抉择
Oh, uh, well, that's tricky.

64
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,070
初代比下一代好看
Um, Original Series over Next Generation,

65
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,680
但皮卡尔比柯克强
but Picard over Kirk.

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,520
正确
Correct.

67
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,400
你已通过室友关系第一关
You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood.

68
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,610
你可以进来了
You may enter.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,520
挺宽敞的嘛
Oh, this is pretty nice.

70
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,450
卧室在里面吧
Uh, the bedrooms are back there?

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
这得看情况
That depends.

72
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,920
我不明白
I don't understand.

73
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,460
卧室的存在有条件的吗
Their existence is conditional?

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,000
不  但对你来说卧室的存在是有条件的
No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,570
你要通过第二和第三关
on you passing the second and third barriers.

76
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,100
有三关啊
There's three?

77
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,120
一个比一个更具挑战性
Each more daunting than the last.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,220
请坐
Have a seat.

79
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,090
好
Okay.

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
不  这是我的专座
No! That's where I sit!

81
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,140
有区别吗
What's the difference?

82
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,110
这个位置正好
This seat is ideally located

83
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,700
能在冬天吹到暖气
both in relation to the heat source in the winter

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,100
夏天吹到对流风
and a cross breeze in the summer.

85
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,810
而且正对着电视机
It also faces the television at a direct angle,

86
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,940
我能专心看电视或者打机
allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play

87
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,860
不受谈话干扰
without being subjected to conversation.

88
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,330
因此  我把它置于永恒状态了
As a result, I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.

89
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,660
可能吗
Can you do that?

90
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,740
[拉丁语]
Cathedra mea, regulae meae.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,600
意思是"我的椅子  我做主"
That's Latin for "My chair, my rules."

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,880
你在电话里说
Now, you said on the phone

93
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,570
你的研究领域是物理
that your area of study is physics.

94
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,370
对  实验物理学
Uh, yeah, experimental physics.

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,630
那是什么
What is that?

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,830
跟你无关
Doesn't concern you.

97
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,580
你每天都会去大学吗
You'll be going to the university every day?

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
对
Yes.

99
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,870
-你有交通工具吗  -有辆车
- And you have a vehicle?  - A car, yeah.

100
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,280
你愿意载我吗
And you'll be willing to drive me?

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
你不会开车吗
Can't you drive?

102
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,330
我会
I can.

103
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,200
我不想开
I choose not to.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,930
那我可以载你
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

105
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,690
这点可以给我加加分对吧
That's a point in my favor, right?

106
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,340
我来写就可以了
Why don't you let me do this.

107
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,980
别这样  我问问而已嘛
Come on, I just asked.

108
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,240
最后一个问题
Last question.

109
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,240
身处一个后启示录的世界中
In a post-apocalyptic world,

110
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,800
你会最先考虑完成以下哪项工作
which task would you assign the highest priority?

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,750
找出可持续利用的食物来源
Locating a sustainable food source,

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,650
重建一个功能政府
reestablishing a functioning government,

113
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,420
生育  还是传承人类文化
procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?

114
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,320
我选  传承文化
Uh, I'm gonna go with... preserving the knowledge.

115
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,550
正解
That's correct.

116
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,220
供你参考  除了生育  其他答案我都接受
FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,210
来  我带你参观一下其他房间
Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.

118
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,190
太好了
Oh, good.

119
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,770
我通过关卡了
I passed the barriers.

120
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,760
只是第二关卡  别翘尾巴呢
The second barrier. Don't get cocky.

121
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,050
这里是浴室
This is the bathroom.

122
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,090
你周期正常吗
Are you fairly regular?

123
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,780
大概吧
Uh, I guess.

124
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,210
你不能给我模棱两可的答案
This isn't going to work if you're guessing.

125
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,120
你什么时候排泄粪便
When do you evacuate your bowels?

126
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,150
我憋不住的时候
When I have to.

127
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,000
你憋不住的时候
When you have to?

128
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,750
抱歉  我不租房间给嬉皮士
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

129
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,670
不好意思  是早上
I-I'm sorry, uh, in the morning.

130
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,740
8点左右
Around 8:00.

131
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,340
8点不行  你可以7点半用厕所
I can't give you 8:00. I can give you 7:30.

132
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,160
好  我同意
Fine. I'll take it.

133
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,310
通过第三关卡
Third barrier passed.

134
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,520
你赢得了参观你卧室的权利
You have won the right to see your room.

135
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,420
噢耶
Huzzah.

136
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,640
是这间吗
Is this it?

137
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,000
不  这是我的卧室
No, this is my room.

138
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,550
人们不能进我的卧室
People don't go in my room.

139
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,840
那你睡哪儿啊
So where do you sleep?

140
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,160
我没明白
I don't understand.

141
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,580
你说人类不能进去  你自己也是人类
If people don't go in there, and you're people, and...

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,900
你  是人类吧
You are people, aren't you?

143
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,140
我开个玩笑
Making a joke.

144
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,400
你经常这样吗
Do you do this often?

145
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,300
偶尔吧
On occasion.

146
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,480
你的卧室
Your room.

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
（"去死吧  谢尔顿"）

148
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,640
你还是重新刷漆吧
You may want to repaint.

149
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,710
他那么多事儿  你居然就搬进去了
And after all that, you just moved in?

150
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,580
才不是那么简单就搬进去
I didn't just move in.

151
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,530
首先我们得谈妥一些细节问题
First we had to iron out a few details.

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,600
室友同意在每周五晚上观看
"Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved

153
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,120
乔斯·威登最新导演的 惊世力作《萤火虫》
for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly."

154
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,120
这条也要放到协议里啊
Does that really need to be in the agreement?

155
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,240
最好是现在定下来  那可要播好几年呢
We might as well settle it now; it's going to be on for years.

156
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,080
在这里草签
Initial here.

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,750
好了  电视以及电影协议完成了
All right, that's television and movies.

158
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,470
第九部分  杂项
Section nine: miscellany.

159
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,320
公寓旗帜是一头
The apartment's flag

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,260
在天蓝色背景下两腿站立的金色狮子
is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.

161
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,390
咱还有旗子呢啊
We have a flag?

162
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,240
千万别弄反了
Never fly it upside down.

163
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,260
除非公寓面临危机
Unless the apartment's in distress.

164
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,930
下一条
And next.

165
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,010
如果我们之中任何一人发明了时空穿梭机
"If either of us ever invents time travel,

166
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,770
我们同意第一站就是回到今天这个会议
"We agree our first stop will be this meeting today

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,810
时间是5秒之后
in precisely five seconds."

168
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,290
好
Okay.

169
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,010
真可惜
That's disappointing.

170
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,830
你到底干嘛要同意那些协议啊
Why on earth did you agree to all that?

171
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,890
那是我见过最棒的公寓了
It was the best apartment I'd seen,

172
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,360
房租也很合理
the rent was very reasonable

173
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,760
而且在通过前三个关卡之后
and after you've passed the first three barriers

174
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,330
你就会不自觉地想一路前进了
you kind of want to take it all the way.

175
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,590
抱歉  莱纳德
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard,

176
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,790
我只能说 自作孽  不可活
it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

177
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,690
好吧  那这样吧
Okay, how about this?

178
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,180
我给你讲讲我第一次带姑娘回家的事儿
Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over.

179
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,370
莱纳德
Leonard?

180
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,450
嘘  假装我们不在
Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

181
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,210
莱纳德
Leonard?

182
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,400
他肯定一会就走了
I'm sure he'll go away.

183
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,980
你不回答我  我就一直敲
I'm just going to keep knocking till you answer.

184
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,060
莱纳德
Leonard?

185
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,530
莱纳德
Leonard?

186
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,110
莱纳德
Leonard?

187
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,200
你想干嘛啊
What do you want?!

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,690
我没说"请进"
I didn't say come in!

189
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,310
是你问我想干什么的
You asked what I wanted.

190
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,940
我想进来啊
I wanted to come in.

191
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,340
我来是因为你违反了我们的室友协议
I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement.

192
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,130
确切来说  是第八部分"宾客"里的
Specifically, section eight--

193
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,010
C小部分"女性"里的第四段  "交媾"
visitors, subsection C; females, paragraph four-- coitus.

194
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,850
在进行交媾之前  室友需要
"Roommates shall give each other

195
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,010
提前12小时通知对方
12 hours notice of impending coitus."

196
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,250
我俩认识还不到12小时呢
I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.

197
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,240
够了  老娘闪人了
That's it! I'm out of here!

198
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,770
乔伊斯  别走啊
But, Joyce, come on.

199
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,350
12小时
12 hours?

200
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,390
我的老天
Oh, my God.

201
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,160
现在觉得同情我了吗
Do I get some sympathy now?

202
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,850
有点儿
A little bit.

203
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,570
好  让我理下思路
Ok, let me get this straight.

204
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,930
你搬进来和他一起住
You move in with this guy,

205
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,090
他让你签了一份相当扯淡的室友协议
he made you sign a rediculous roommate agreement,

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,690
然后他在你和那个乔伊斯·金爱爱的时候
then he walks into your bedroom

207
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,370
走进了你的卧室
while you're doing this Joyce Kim

208
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,410
可你居然还没搬走
and you still stay.

209
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,190
其实乔伊斯·金这事也不能怪他
Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.

210
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,530
为什么
Why not?

211
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,130
当时我正致力于某些政府研究
Well, I was doing some government research at the time,

212
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,030
军用火箭燃料
you know, military, rocket fuel.

213
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,300
算是国家机密吧
It's kind of secret.

214
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,100
这和乔伊斯·金有毛关系
What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?

215
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,400
后来发现她是个朝鲜间谍
As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy.

216
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,770
好在我还没透露什么重要机密
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out

217
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,070
谢尔顿就把她赶了出去
before I revealed anything important.

218
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,540
我不是我说我肯定会透露
Which I-I'm not saying I would have.

219
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,170
就因为这样吗
So, what, that's it?

220
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
一直以来你忍受谢尔顿
You've stayed with Sheldon all this time

221
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,740
就为了感谢他让你免受牢狱之灾吗
because he kept you from going to federal prison?

222
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,350
这是理由之一
That was part of it.

223
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,790
理由之二和那电梯有关
The other part is what happened with the elevator.

224
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,260
我正想问呢
Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that.

225
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,870
你说你搬来时电梯还能用呢
You said it was working when you moved in.

226
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
之前是能用  但某天晚上  谢尔顿下班回来...
It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work...

227
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,210
这里是怎么回事
What is going on here?

228
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,990
好啊  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
这是霍华德和拉杰
This is Howard and Raj.

230
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,140
他们也在大学里工作
They work at the university, too.

231
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,080
-好  -好
- Hey. - Hey.

232
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,130
我一会儿找你算账
I'll get to you later.

233
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,460
你们坐的什么呢
What are you sitting on?

234
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,400
他们不好说  我正坐在屁垫上呢
I can't speak for these guys, but I'm sitting on my tushie.

235
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,230
我开个玩笑
It's a joke.

236
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,960
有点冷
Not a good idea.

237
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,140
屁垫就是屁股吧
"Tushie" Is buttocks, right?

238
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,350
-米错  -搞笑
- Right. - Hilarious.

239
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,210
这沙发是怎么回事
Explain the couch.

240
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,370
一楼的住户今天搬家
Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out,

241
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,770
他们100刀贱卖给了我
and they sold it to me for $100.

242
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,410
霍华德和拉杰帮我搬了进来
Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.

243
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,410
我们的家具怎么不好了
But what's wrong with the furniture we have?

244
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,560
就俩草坪椅而已
They're lawn chairs.

245
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,490
别人来就没的坐了
And there was no place for company.

246
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,910
你没意识到  我这是故意的嘛
Did it occur to you that was by design?

247
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,770
根据室友协议
According to the roommate agreement,

248
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,510
我有权使用 50%立方米的公共区域
I'm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.

249
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,850
但你没有发邮件事先告知我 所以还是违规了
But you didn't notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.

250
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,500
我告知你了
I did notify you.

251
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,460
是吗
Oh, you did, did you?

252
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,320
真见鬼
Oh, drat!

253
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,900
被垃圾邮件过滤器害惨了
Hoisted by my own spam filter.

254
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,940
干垃圾邮件过滤器毛事了
What am I doing in your spam folder?

255
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,310
自你上次发我一张弹钢琴的猫咪图
I put you there after you forwarded me

256
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,750
标题还说什么"很搞笑"  我就把你给扔垃圾邮件里去了
a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled "This is funny."

257
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,020
那个我看过
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

258
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,490
太搞笑了
That was hilarious.

259
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,450
这和电梯有什么关系
Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?

260
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,740
别急嘛  就说到了
I'm getting to it.

261
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,890
等到微软出了自己的播放器 到时你就等着后悔吧
I assure you, you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod

262
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,990
把钱浪费在一文不值滴苹果机上
when Microsoft comes out with theirs.

263
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,780
你对所有东西都有意见吗
Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?

264
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,230
对
Yes.

265
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,350
你还假设你永远正确吗
And you just assume you're always right?

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
这可不是假设  而是事实
It's not an assumption.

267
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,550
和我换个座位
Change seats with me.

268
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,220
-干嘛  -我不喜欢这个位子
- Why? - I don't like this spot.

269
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,680
讲话还得不停转头
I have to keep turning my head.

270
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,390
好吧
Fine.

271
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,740
哇哦  巴比伦5号开始了
Ooh, it's time for Babylon 5!

272
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,470
这里可不看巴比伦5号
We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.

273
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,320
为什么
Why not?

274
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,390
因为没人爱看
Because no one likes Babylon 5.

275
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
我就爱看
I like it.

276
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,990
-我也爱看  -我也是
- Me, too. - So do I.

277
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,350
得了  三比一
There you go-- three against one.

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,630
他们又没投票权
They don't get a vote.

279
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,810
所以应该是一比一
It's one against one.

280
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,480
而根据室友协议
And according to the roommate agreement,

281
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,760
如果平局就由我说了算
all ties will be settled by me.

282
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,640
但我没同意
But I said no to that.

283
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,100
可我同意了
And I said yes.

284
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,130
而平局则由我说了算
And I settle all ties.

285
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,880
和我换座位
Change seats with me.

286
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
干嘛
Why?

287
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,490
这里有穿堂风吹我脖子
There's a draft on my neck over here.

288
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,160
那我被吹了怎么办
So, I get the draft?

289
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,880
你穿高领套头衫呢  没事
You're protected by your turtleneck.

290
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,450
好吧
Fine.

291
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,520
这是件V领假衬衫
And it's a dickey.

292
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,550
还是觉得不自在
I'm still not comfortable.

293
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,280
难怪了
Of course.

294
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,480
人太多了
There's too many people here.

295
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,420
这容易解决
We can fix that.

296
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,500
我们撤
Let's leave.

297
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,800
就是  去我家好了
Yeah, we can go over to my place.

298
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,710
等下
Wait.

299
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,980
我去拿外套
Let me get my jacket.

300
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,440
-我们不带你一起  -为什么
- You're not going with us. - Why not?

301
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,910
我们就是为了摆脱你
You're the guy we're trying to get away from.

302
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,670
既然如此  外套就能免了
Well, in that case, I don't need my jacket.

303
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,930
强调一下句法错误
And for the record, the correct syntax is:

304
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,090
应该是: 我就是你们要摆脱的那个人
I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away.

305
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,080
这才对
Oh, yes.

306
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,490
这才是我的专属座位
This is definitely going to be my spot.

307
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,100
好吧
Okay.

308
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,190
你咋知道他说的什么  你都不在屋里了
How do you know he said that? You left the room.

309
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,120
到底想不想我给你涂完你的大脚丫了
Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?

310
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,360
好啦  说下去
Fine. Go ahead.

311
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,630
霍华德  你有小伙伴来玩吗
Howard, are you having a playdate?

312
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,440
才不是小伙伴
I don't have playdates!

313
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,310
是我同事
I have colleagues!

314
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,950
他们父母知道他们来这的吧
Do their parents know they're here?

315
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,790
不  但你继续吼的话  他们可能就能听到
No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they'll hear you!

316
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,790
那是你爸吗
That your dad?

317
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,130
她脸上再长点胡子的话  就差不多了
She grows any more hair on her face, yes.

318
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,600
天 那是两级火箭吗
Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?

319
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,310
三级火箭  我自己设计的引擎
Three. I designed the engine myself.

320
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,680
酷  速度能达一马赫以上吗
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

321
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,510
有可能的  只要政府正在研究的
Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel

322
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,490
那项新燃料项目被我弄到手
the government's been working on.

323
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,630
今天可能就是你的幸运日
Oh, this just might be your lucky day.

324
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,470
霍华德  我放柜子上的奥利奥饼干呢
Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!

325
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,690
我没见过你的奥利奥
I haven't seen your Oreos!

326
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,760
就别边吃边洗澡了
Just take your bath without them!

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
为什么说那天是他的幸运日
So, why was it his lucky day?

328
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,970
因为我公寓里 恰好就有一点火箭燃料
Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.

329
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,670
你公寓里放火箭燃料干嘛
What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?

330
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,970
乔伊斯·金对我的工作有点好奇
Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living,

331
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,400
我是想给她展示一下
and I was going to kind of show it to her.

332
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,810
那并不重要  重点是
It's not important. The point is,

333
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,850
我们仨回到了公寓
the guys and I went back to the apartment.

334
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,420
你到底讲不讲电梯的事啊
Are we ever going to get to the elevator?

335
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,450
马上就讲到了
Yeah, we're really close.

336
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,650
我们回到了公寓
Uh, uh, we're at the apartment.

337
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,230
诀窍在于要混入Tovex水胶炸药 以制造出一种易燃的凝胶
The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel

338
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,300
它能产生八百万牛顿以上的推力
that will generate over 8,000 kilo-newtons of thrust.

339
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,440
-好酷  -太棒了
- Cool. - Nice.

340
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,740
没用的
Won't work.

341
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,680
抱歉  我干这行可是很久了的
Excuse me, but I've been working on this a long time.

342
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,010
相信我  绝对管用
Trust me-- it'll work.

343
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,110
你还没发现自己的错误  是吗
You don't see your mistake, do you?

344
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,710
根本就没错误
There's no mistake.

345
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,450
那是给全尺寸火箭用的  而不是给模型用的
This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.

346
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,090
我已经调整过配方了
Well, I've adjusted the formula.

347
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,350
没调整对
Not correctly.

348
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,320
行了  我受够你了
Okay, I've had it with you.

349
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,610
你可能是专精于 理论物理和科幻节目
You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs

350
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,260
还有坐沙发哪个座位
and where to sit on a freaking couch,

351
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,060
但这是应用物理学范畴
but this is applied physics.

352
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,850
而说到应用物理学...
And when it comes to applied physic... uh-oh.

353
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,840
怎么回事
What's happening?

354
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,640
大事不妙  非常不妙
A bad thing. A very bad thing.

355
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,700
快开门
Get the door.

356
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,210
快开门  快开门
Get the door! Get the door!

357
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,580
快开门  快开门
Get the door! Get the door!

358
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,690
你还想等电梯
You're waiting for the elevator?!

359
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,560
哦  对哦
Oh. Right.

360
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,480
等等  电梯到了
Wait. It's here.

361
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,300
快给我
Give me that.

362
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,500
你这是干嘛  我有的是时间...
What'd you do that for? I had plenty of time...

363
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,780
不用谢
You're welcome.

364
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,510
谢尔顿不仅救了我一命
Not only did Sheldon save my life,

365
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,350
他还没向房东告发我
he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

366
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,520
或报警
Or the police.

367
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,820
或报告国家安全局
Or Homeland Security.

368
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,690
所以你就是害我
Okay, so, basically, you're the reason

369
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,520
不得不每天上上下下跑三层楼梯的人
I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?

370
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,790
我是干了件蠢事
So I did something stupid.

371
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,830
相信你年少无知时  肯定也干过蠢事
I'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger.

372
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,360
七年前你都在干些什么
What were you doing seven years ago?

373
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,000
说什么呀  那时我才是高中生
Excuse me, I was in high school.

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,030
就知道学习  洁身自爱
Studying, keeping my nose clean,

375
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,170
在社区做志愿服务
doing volunteer work for the community.

376
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,040
没怀孕
Not pregnant.

377
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,580
太好了
Yes!

378
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,890
乌班图
Oh, Ubuntu,

379
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,090
你是我最爱的Linux操作系统
you are my favorite Linux-based operating system.

380
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,430
怎么有甲基丙烯酸酯的味道
Why do I smell methacrylate?

381
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,700
我涂的透明指甲油 我做了个美甲
Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi.

382
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,600
男人也可以美甲
Men can get those.

383
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,570
不管怎样  我可能该跟你道歉
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

384
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,290
你还不确定这点吗
There's doubt?

385
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,510
我确实认可过自动调温器的设置
I did agree to the thermostat setting,

386
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,650
不该私自去改变它
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

387
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,550
这不是道歉
That's not an apology.

388
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,090
只是承认我是对的
Simply an acknowledgement that I was right.

389
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,890
好吧  我很抱歉
Ok,I'm sorry.

390
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,820
这就对了
There you go.

391
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,390
那我们就算和好了
So we are good?

392
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
什么和好
Good what?

393
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,870
算了
Never mind.

394
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,520
我看电视可以吧
Okay if I watch some TV?

395
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,800
看吧
Go ahead.

396
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,210
接下来播放《巴比伦5号》
Up next Babylon 5.

397
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,510
你甚至都没在看电视
You're not even watching!

398
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,870
但我听得到
I can hear it!

399
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,920
他们的对白又冒犯到你了
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

400
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,870
那简直不能成为对白
I would hardly call that dialogue!

401
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,720
你真是有病  你知道吗
You're insane, you know that?!

402
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,520
别逼我把那面旗再颠倒过来
Don't make me turn that flag upside down,

403
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,830
你知道我做得出来的
'cause you know I'll do it!
