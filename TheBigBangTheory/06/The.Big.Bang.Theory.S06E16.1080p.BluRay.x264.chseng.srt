1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,840
你绝对想不到我今天工作时遇上了什么事
You'll never believe what happened to me at work today.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,400
一个老头子吃东西噎到了  我救了他一命
This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,570
真的吗  你对他用了海姆立克急救法吗
You're kidding. Did you Heimlich him?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,030
没有  我说  天啊  我觉得他噎着了
No. I said, "Oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking,"

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,220
然后一个勤杂工对他用了海姆立克急救法
and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,960
你真是英雄
You're a hero.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,090
我就是这意思
Yeah, that was the point of the story.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,960
说到工作  你周四晚上
Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,260
是不是不用上班
if you have Thursday night off?

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,090
好像是  怎么了
Um, I think so. Why?

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,790
什么叫"怎么了"  那天是情人节啊
What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day.

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,890
对哦
Oh, right.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,550
我们可以约个会
Yeah, we can do something.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,860
你可以表现得更热情一点
You could be a little more into it.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,560
我很热情  我很热情
No, I'm into it, I'm into it.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,620
只是要想度过一个特别之夜压力好大
Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special,

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,220
而且结果总不尽如人意
and it never works out.

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,150
今年的情人节会有所不同的
Okay, well, this time it's going to be different.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,050
因为我就像一个浪漫忍者
Because I am like a romance ninja.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,640
出乎你意料  突然一下
You don't see it coming, and then bam!

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,930
浪漫  注意  心形  亲亲  爱情
Romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,910
有时我以为我把你改造得
You know, sometimes I think I've made you

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,300
比以前酷多了
so much cooler than you used to be,

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,160
然后你就会闹腾两下证明我错了
and then you go and do that.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,750
总而言之
So, in conclusion,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,480
我认为吃完辣椒后
I believe the painful sensation felt

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
排泄时感受到的痛苦
after passing a meal of spicy chilies

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,440
证明了直肠的确有味觉
is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,660
我同意  但你改变了话题
I concur, but you changed the subject.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,000
我们情人节有什么安排
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,850
被你发现了
Oh, you caught that, did you?

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,550
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十六集

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,990
好
Okay.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,000
行
Okay.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,930
可以
Okay.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,540
没问题
Okay.

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,400
好的啦
Okay!

38
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,340
好
Okay.

39
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,440
一切都还"好"吗
Everything okay?

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,340
妮妮有些暴躁
Bernie's a little cranky

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,820
因为她一天工作17个小时
since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,490
我也没闲着  因为我一直
And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,080
都在忙着玩《刺客信条》
busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,780
斯图尔特
Hey, Stuart,

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,810
你情人节有什么安排吗
you got anything going on for Valentine's Day?

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,530
没有
Not really.

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,260
只是把这里所有尖锐的东西都藏起来
Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here

48
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,110
然后紧张兮兮到天明
and white-knuckling it till morning.

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,760
你打算干什么
What do you got going on?

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,300
我本打算和我的小宝贝
Oh, well, I was going to spend the night

51
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,430
共度今晚  但是
with my special little lady, but, uh,

52
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,230
它长了寄生虫  所以我得送它去看兽医
she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,700
肯定能找到事情打发时间的
There must be something we can do.

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,780
不如你晚点关门
Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late,

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,530
我们举办一个派对
and we throw a party for all the people

56
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,100
邀请所有没约会的人
who don't have dates?

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,210
听起来真是个好主意
That actually sounds kind of nice.

58
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,740
派对主题是  一个男人所拥有的
Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,120
最伟大的爱就是对自己的爱
a man can have is the love he has with himself.

60
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,270
挺好
That's good.

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,420
或者换个听着不那么像打飞机的主题
Or maybe something a little less "Hand in the pants."

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,440
艾利克斯  太好了
Oh, Alex, excellent.

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,850
我有个研究问题
I have a research problem

64
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,760
我相信你能助我一臂之力
that I believe you can help with.

65
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,780
库珀博士  谢谢
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you.

66
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,300
我一直在等待一个机会
I've been waiting for an opportunity

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,780
为你的科研做出贡献
to contribute to your scientific work.

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,170
不不  没那可能  绝对没
Oh, no, no. That's not going to happen, no.

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,050
我是要你为我的女朋友
What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,010
挑情人节礼物
for my girlfriend.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,780
你知道我推掉了
You realize I passed up an opportunity

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,920
费米实验室的工作  而选择与你合作吧
to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.
美国最重要的物理学研究中心之一

73
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,900
看来那些小伙子们得找别人
Well, I guess those chaps will have to have

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,540
来给他们的女友买礼物了
someone else buy their girlfriends presents.

75
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,530
这里有
Now, here is...

76
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,000
瞧瞧
Let's see.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,230
这里
This is...

78
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,970
这里大概是两千块
This is about $2,000.

79
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,880
我觉得她喜欢猴子和灰色
Um, I think she likes monkeys and the color gray.

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,530
为我的科研做出贡献
Contribute to my work.

81
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,200
小孩子真是会胡扯
Ah, kids say the darnedest things.

82
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,600
去吃中饭吗
Hey, you coming to lunch?

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
稍等片刻
Yeah, one second.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
过来  给你看个东西
Come here. I want to show you something.

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,790
你在看什么呢
What you looking at?

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,920
我想送个非常浪漫的
Well, I was trying to come up with something

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,580
情人节礼物给伯纳黛特
really romantic to give Bernadette

88
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,250
因为她最近
for Valentine's Day since she's been

89
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,710
真的很讨厌
such a pain in the ass.

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
找不到上面写着"你很讨厌"的贺卡吗
You can't find a card that says that?

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,220
来看看
Check it out.

92
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,750
我动用了材料科学实验室的
I used the atomic force microscope

93
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,280
原子力显微镜  在沙粒千分之一大小的心形上
in the material science lab and wrote our initials

94
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,930
刻上了我俩姓名首字母
in a heart 1/1,000 the size of a grain of sand.

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,780
太帅了
Oh, that's cool.

96
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,920
给微生物学家准备的"微小"情人节礼物
A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.

97
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,760
她"微小"的丈夫送的
From her micro-husband.

98
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,060
太棒了
That is amazing.

99
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,390
你花了多长时间
How long did this take you?

100
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,660
大概12个小时
Mmm, about 12 hours.

101
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,650
我忙活了整个通宵
I pulled an all-nighter.

102
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,770
我知道  我的游戏时间
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite

103
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,010
惨遭侵占
out of my video game time.

104
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,030
你和佩妮打算干什么
What are you and Penny doing?

105
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,280
我打算带她去高级餐厅共进晚餐
Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.

106
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,380
还不错  但从浪漫的角度来说
Oh, that's not bad, but as far as romance goes,

107
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,210
我觉得我的礼物完全胜过了...
I think my gift hits it right out of...

108
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,680
-想和我们共进晚餐吗  -带上我吧
- Want to come to dinner with us? - Yes, please.

109
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,210
好
Okay.

110
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,150
艾米马上就会到
Amy will be here shortly,

111
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,720
她在期待超赞的情人节礼物  所以
expecting the perfect Valentine's gift, so...

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
该你了丫头
you're up kid.

113
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,380
尽请支招吧
Dazzle me. Go.

114
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,030
我确实有几个妙招
Okay, I think I have some really great choices.

115
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,450
我到艾米的Facebook主页上
I went on Amy's Facebook page

116
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,700
了解了一下她的喜好
and read up on her interests.

117
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,740
瞧吧  我就绝对想不到这样做
Now, see, I never would have thought to do that.

118
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,640
很明显  把此事交给你来办
Clearly, I made a good choice

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,750
真是太英明了
farming this out to you.

120
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,320
你得知道
But I am telling you,

121
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,360
艾米找到我做男朋友可真是中了头奖
Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.

122
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,610
总之  我脚上有袜子
Anyway, my socks are on.
knock socks off 给人惊喜

123
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,530
快快把它们吓掉吧
Let's knock them off.

124
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,550
我知道她喜欢弹竖琴
Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp,

125
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,840
所以我找到了这个精致的音乐盒
so I found this beautiful music box

126
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,600
弹奏的是她最喜欢的曲子
that plays one of her favorite songs.

127
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,330
可是艾米已经有真正的竖琴了
Now, Amy already has a real harp.

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,970
那玩意可以弹任何曲子
And it can play any song.

129
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,180
这一招的高明之处在哪
What are you trying to pull here?

130
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,170
-不  我只是觉得这个  -下一个
- No, I just thought it would be... - Next.

131
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,920
好吧
Okay.

132
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,930
我知道她很喜欢《坎特伯雷故事集》
Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales,
英国诗人乔叟的著名诗体短篇小说集

133
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,150
所以我找到了
so I found...

134
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,120
这张很酷的地图
this cool map

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,410
上面标明了书中人物在英国的旅行路线
that illustrates the characters' journey through England.

136
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,910
我们可以选个漂亮的框子裱起来
I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.

137
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,890
但她的手机里装了谷歌地图
But she's got Google Maps on her phone.

138
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,290
我词穷了
I don't know how to respond to that.

139
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,870
我希望还有第三个不错的选择
Well, I hope it's with a third good option,

140
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,790
这前两个也太逊了
because these first two... blah.

141
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,070
好吧
Okay.

142
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,560
幸运的是  我把最好的留在最后了
Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last.

143
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,150
艾米是个神经学家
Since Amy's a neuroscientist,

144
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,960
我做了点调查  发现
I did some research and found out

145
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
圣地亚哥·拉蒙尼·卡哈尔
that Santiago Ramony Cajal,

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
现代神经科学之父
the father of modern neuroscience,

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,710
曾绘制过许多脑细胞的手绘图
did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.

148
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,320
而我想办法拿到了
And I managed to find

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,640
这幅有其签名的版本
this signed print.

150
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,400
这个可真了不起
Oh, this is truly remarkable.

151
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
谢谢
Thank you.

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,760
我自己收下了
I think I'll keep it for myself.

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,250
那你的女朋友呢
What about your girlfriend?

154
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,450
太晚了  我说了这个归我了
It's too late. I call dibs.

155
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,760
这家餐厅真是不错
This place is really beautiful.

156
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,620
浪漫忍者
Wah... romance ninja.

157
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,880
抱歉迟到了
Sorry we're late.

158
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,330
没关系  我们刚坐下
No problem. We just sat down.

159
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,910
想来点红酒吗
Mmm, would you like some wine?

160
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,670
好  给我倒上
Yeah, fill her up.

161
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,980
叫你停再停
I'll tell you when to stop.

162
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,230
一切都还好吗
Is everything okay?

163
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,250
好极了  没法再好了
Terrific. Couldn't be better.

164
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,150
你奈我何
Oh, bite me.

165
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,230
我们今晚还是可以开开心心的
Look, we can still have a nice night.

166
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,420
告诉我在哪就行了
Just tell me where it is.

167
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,690
你要是能说到做到  我就会告诉你了
Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I'd tell you.

168
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,270
什么东西在哪
Uh, where what is?

169
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,820
她像对付小孩一样  把我的游戏机藏起来了
She hid my XBOX like I'm a child.

170
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,110
那可是我妈妈给我的生日礼物
Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday,

171
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,280
你要是不还给我  我就告状去
so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.

172
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,110
我每天都工作到很晚
I've been working late every night.

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,040
我只不过是要求他
All I asked was that he

174
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,010
把家里收拾干净  洗一次衣服
clean the apartment and do one load of laundry.

175
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,050
但他做了吗  没有
But did he do it? No.

176
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,220
他就那么心安理得地玩那蠢游戏
He just kept on playing that stupid game.

177
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,540
你这么喜欢按按钮
You like pushing buttons so much,

178
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,910
干嘛不按按洗衣机的按钮
try pushing them on the washing machine.

179
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,310
我道过歉了
I said I'm sorry.

180
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,960
道歉可洗不了我的内裤  哥们
Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.

181
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,460
我跟你说过了  翻过来穿就行了
I told you, turn them inside out.

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,340
然后我说我不愿意你奈我何
And I told you to bite me.

183
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,330
我们还想度过美好时光呢
Trying to have a magical night here, guys.

184
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,810
-见鬼  -怎么了
- Oh, son of a bitch. - What?

185
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,550
没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,920
说嘛
No, tell me.

187
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,460
那是我的前男友
It's just this guy I used to date.

188
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,780
后来他背着我和我的朋友格雷琴偷腥
Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen,

189
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,850
也就是和他在一起那女的
who's here with him now.

190
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,290
不是吧
You're kidding.

191
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,150
她好像瘦了不少  可恶
And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.

192
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,260
我知道他们的出现让你不开心
I know it's not ideal,

193
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,810
但没必要让他们毁了我们的夜晚
but don't let them ruin our night.

194
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,620
对  你说得对
No, you're totally right.

195
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,760
她可能是因为快死了所以这么瘦
She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.

196
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,810
这么想就对了
That's the spirit.

197
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,130
管他们的呢
You know what, screw them.

198
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,450
我们的夜晚会比他们的难忘许多
Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.

199
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,890
对
Yeah.

200
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,960
怎么了
What?

201
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,280
逗姐玩呢是吧
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

202
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,350
天啊  我愿意
Oh, my God, yes.

203
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,340
我愿意嫁给你
Of course I'll marry you.

204
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,920
谁说我们不行了
Two can play this game.

205
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,670
-佩妮  -给我起来
- Penny... - Get up.

206
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,040
好
All right.

207
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,840
所有在情人节没有伴侣的单身人士
It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day

208
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,800
能来这里聚聚真好
can come here tonight and be together.

209
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,590
是啊  我很期待
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

210
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,320
事实上  我就想待在这里  哪也不想去
In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.

211
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,920
除非有任何人愿意和你约会
Except on a date with anybody.

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
真的任何人都可以
Literally anybody.

213
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,670
我们在一起总是很开心
You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out.

214
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,570
如果你是个女孩的话
If you were a girl,

215
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,590
我们所有问题就迎刃而解了
all our problems would be solved.

216
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,700
什么
What?

217
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,790
你仔细想想
Oh, yeah, think about it.

218
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,260
我们可以总在一起玩
We'd hang out,

219
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,660
可以一起看漫画  一起看电影
we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.

220
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,590
这算得上是世间最美妙的关系了
It'd be like the best relationship ever.

221
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,080
听起来是挺好的
That does sound nice.

222
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,760
然后我送你回家  脱下你的小黑裙
Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress

223
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,840
把你搞到七晕八素分不清南北
and just pile-drive you into oblivion.

224
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,210
什么
What?

225
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,930
真不敢相信
Oh, I can't believe

226
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,410
他要和破坏我们感情的小三结婚了
he's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.

227
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,750
这不是挺美好的吗
Isn't it kind of nice?

228
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,150
他曾经爱上了错误的对象
I mean, he was with the wrong person,

229
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,530
如今终于找到他的真爱
and now he found the right person.

230
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,120
怎么  我成了错误的对象吗
What, so I'm the wrong person?

231
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,880
那你是不是也想和格雷琴在一起啊
Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.

232
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,180
他们看起来挺开心的
They do look happy.

233
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,360
就算是今晚开心
Yeah, maybe tonight.

234
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,350
但一年以后  他就会
But a year from now, he'll be

235
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,090
潜伏在水槽底下摸寻他的游戏机了
crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox.

236
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,050
他肯定会的
Well, he will.

237
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,200
算了吧  何不忘掉他们
You know what? Why don't we just forget about them

238
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,140
好好享受我们自己的情人节
and enjoy our Valentine's Day?

239
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,380
好的  没问题
Yes, absolutely.

240
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,750
现在他们居然玩那种假到爆的
Now they're doing that phony

241
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,120
交杯酒把戏
link-arm-drink thingy.

242
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
这一招还是我教他的呢
I totally taught him that.

243
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,850
我以为我们说好不管他们了
I thought we were letting it go.

244
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,000
当然  只是  这太不公平了  好吗
We were; it's just... it's not fair, okay?

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,280
他们不是什么好人
They're bad people.

246
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,610
不配拥有幸福大结局
It's not supposed to end happy for them;

247
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,740
明明应该是我找到最后的幸福
it's supposed to end happy for me.

248
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,430
你已经找到你的幸福了啊
It did end happy for you.

249
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,300
你现在和我在一起
You're here with me.

250
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,010
是  是  我知道
Yeah, yeah, I know.

251
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,170
你这么敷衍的样子  很难不让我受伤
Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.

252
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,630
得了  别又扯到你身上去了
Oh, come on, don't make this about you.

253
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,390
不是我  这是你的问题
Oh, I'm not. It's about you.

254
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,560
随便怎么都好  行吗
Yeah, well, whatever, okay?

255
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,190
我告诉过你  情人节就没好事
I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.

256
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,550
这个情人节不好过  而你就是罪魁祸首
This one does, and you're the reason why.

257
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,890
什么
What?

258
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,800
和他们比起来
You know, compared to them,

259
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,780
我觉得我们俩还过得挺不错的
I'm feeling pretty good about us.

260
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,720
我也这么觉得
Me, too.

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,570
不如我们不吃甜点  早点回家
How about we blow off dessert, go home early...

262
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,960
然后我把衣服都洗了
I'll do that laundry.

263
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,230
谢谢你
Thank you.

264
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,080
我爱你
I love you.

265
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,620
我也爱你
Love you, too.

266
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,490
你到底把游戏机藏哪里了
So where'd you hide it?

267
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,620
你永远想不到去看的地方
Where you'd never look.

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,420
见鬼  原来是藏在洗衣机里了
Damn it, it's in the washing machine.

269
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,670
你好
Hello.

270
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,030
你好
Hello.

271
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,680
情人节快乐
Happy Valentine's Day.

272
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,070
好的
Okay.

273
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,610
我们去吃饭吧
Shall we go to dinner?

274
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,740
等一下
Hang on.

275
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,320
你知道  我原本计划了传统式的浪漫之夜
As you know, I had planned a traditional evening

276
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
还有互赠礼物
of romance and gifts.

277
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,950
是的
Yes,

278
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,090
而你也知道
and as you know,

279
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,680
我计划全程假装乐在其中
I planned to pretend to enjoy it.

280
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,560
我已经练习这种面部表情一整天了
I've been working on this facial expression all day.

281
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,410
我感谢你的努力
And I appreciate your effort,

282
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,930
但仔细一想
but upon contemplation,

283
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,170
我觉得自己太自私了
I decided I was being selfish.

284
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,350
所以  我取消了晚餐订位
So, I canceled our dinner reservations

285
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,860
想到了另一个更好的办法
and came up with an even better way

286
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,100
来庆祝情人节
to celebrate Valentine's Day.

287
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,300
什么办法
What is that?

288
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,960
就是什么都不干
By doing none of it--

289
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,810
不吃什么晚餐
no dinner,

290
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,760
不要什么浪漫  不送任何礼物
no romance, no gifts.

291
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,340
我们留在家里  点个披萨外送
We stay here, order a pizza

292
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,070
看一部你最爱的
and watch one of your beloved

293
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,380
星际大战之类的片子
Star War Trek things.

294
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,140
你说真的吗
Really?

295
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,390
这才是你真心最爱的  不是吗
Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?

296
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,000
胜过世上的一切
More than anything.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,390
好吧
Well, then...

298
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,280
那我们就这么做吧
that's what we're going to do.

299
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,890
我不知该说什么了
Well... I don't know what to say.

300
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,410
这可是我收到过的所有礼物中
This is the most thoughtful gift

301
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,430
最有心的一件了
that anyone's ever given me.

302
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,170
比我上午送给自己的
And that's including an amazing gift

303
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,470
一件超级棒的礼物还要好
that I gave myself earlier today.

304
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,840
我是你的女朋友  这是我的责任
I'm your girlfriend. That's my job.

305
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,070
我知道挑礼物这事总是让你倍感压力
And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you,

306
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,010
所以不管你准备了什么给我  你都可以退掉它
so whatever you got me, you can return.

307
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,500
不行
No.

308
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,480
不  就因为今晚你什么都没为我做
No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight,

309
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,240
我希望你收下这个礼物
I want you to have it.

310
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,040
这是什么
What's this?

311
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,370
读读看
Read it.

312
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,020
谢尔顿·库珀
"Sheldon Cooper,

313
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,690
加利福尼亚理工大学员工资料
Caltech University employee information"?

314
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,160
读读下面
At the bottom.

315
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,290
一旦发生紧急情况  请与
"In case of emergency, please contact...

316
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,770
艾米·菲拉·福勒联系
Amy Farrah Fowler."

317
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,490
还有我的电话号码
And there's my phone number.

318
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,950
这真是你给我的最美好的礼物了
This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.

319
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,900
反正我想
Well, I thought,

320
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,680
如果我中风  或者得了肾结石
if I have a stroke or a kidney stone,

321
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,270
我会愿意和谁分享这件事呢
who would I want to share that with?

322
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,730
而你选择了我
And you picked me.

323
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,280
就像你刚才说的
It's like you said--

324
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,150
你是我的女朋友
you're my girlfriend.

325
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,500
谢尔顿
Oh, Sheldon.

326
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,440
可以了
Okay.

327
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,180
别扫情人节的雅兴  快给我叫披萨外送
Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.

328
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,050
-晚安  -好的
- Night. - Yep.

329
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,790
知道吗
You know what?

330
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
你刚才真够差劲的
That was pretty crappy of you.

331
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,880
我只想给你一个浪漫的情人之夜
I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night,

332
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,630
而你却竭尽所能地搞破坏
and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.

333
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,770
没错
Yeah, I know.

334
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,740
我就是一个贱人
I'm a total bitch.

335
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,530
-我没这么说  -我是的
- I'm not saying that. - Well, I am.

336
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,690
好吧  拗不过你  你是贱人
Fine, you win. You're a bitch.

337
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,930
我们为什么不能好好过一个情人节
Why couldn't we just have a nice time?

338
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,550
我不知道
I don't know.

339
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,640
也许是因为最近我们进展太顺利了
Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately

340
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,880
我真的很开心
and I've been really happy.

341
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,200
好吧  你这解释让我更混乱了
Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.

342
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,780
显然  我有承诺恐惧症
Obviously, I have some commitment issues.

343
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,720
有眼睛的人都看得出来  继续说
Glaringly obvious. Go on.

344
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,250
只要我们继续顺利交往下去
As long as things keep going great between us,

345
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,640
你会不断向我求婚
you'll keep asking me to marry you,

346
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,240
最终我会答应
and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes,

347
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,910
然后我们就会天长地久
and then we're gonna be married forever,

348
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,830
整件事让我想起来就头皮发麻
and the whole thing just freaks me out.

349
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,100
好吧
Okay.

350
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,510
我知道我这人有喜欢求婚的毛病
I know I propose a lot.

351
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,840
你看这样行不行
So how about this?

352
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,430
我发誓  我再也不会向你求婚
I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.

353
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,410
你这是什么意思
What... what do you mean?

354
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,650
你是要和我分手吗
Are you breaking up with me?

355
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,420
不
No.

356
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,330
不是的
No, no, no, no.

357
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,700
但如果有一天你想结婚
But if someday you decide you want to get married,

358
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,650
你得向我求婚
you have to propose to me.

359
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,220
-真的吗  -是的
- Really? - Yes.

360
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,950
主动权在你
It's all on you.

361
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,980
不过我得提醒你  真到了那个时候
But I got to tell you, when the time comes,

362
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,910
你一点也不能含糊
I want the whole nine yards.

363
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,190
你得给我单膝跪地  满地鲜花
I want you down on one knee, flowers.

364
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,560
你得把我哄得芳心犹如小鹿乱撞
I want to be swept off my feet.

365
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,390
没问题
Yeah, you got it.

366
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
我不反对来个惊喜
And I'm cool with surprises.

367
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,450
但千万别来个大屏幕求婚
But nothing on a Jumbotron.

368
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,330
我不想满球场的人看着我泪如雨下
I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.

369
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,970
好的
Okay.

370
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,450
知道吗
You know what?

371
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,330
可能酒劲上来了
This might be the wine talking,

372
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,380
我有个非常重要的问题问你
but I have a very important question to ask you.

373
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,440
是吗
You do?

374
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,080
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
Leonard Hofstadter...

375
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,390
什么事
Yes?

376
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,500
你愿做我今夜的情人吗
...will you be my valentine?

377
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,570
抱歉  咱们明年再说吧
Sorry. Maybe next year.

378
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,140
开个玩笑
I'm just kidding!

379
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,610
浪漫忍者杀到  咱上床去吧
Romance ninja. Let's have sex!

380
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,060
多谢你们办这场派对
Thank you, guys, for doing this.

381
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,800
很高兴你能来
We're glad you could make it.

382
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,810
通常我在情人节这天是悲伤寂寞的
Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone.

383
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,720
今年  我只是悲伤而已
This year, I'm just sad.

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,800
你说这个节日怎么就令大家这么不开心呢
What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?

385
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,750
就是说啊
I know.

386
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,390
大多数时候  我都挺讨厌自己的
I hate myself most of the time,

387
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,800
但今晚  我知道其他人也好不到哪里去
but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.

388
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,730
我觉得你挺酷的
I think you're cool.

389
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,040
多谢你看得起
Great.

390
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,820
我跟你们说
I got to tell you,

391
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,720
我们不能再这样自我折磨了
we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this.

392
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,150
各位  不好意思
Excuse me, everybody.

393
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,430
请大家听我说几句
Can I have your attention, please?

394
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,030
今晚我们齐聚一堂是因为
We're all here tonight because...

395
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,070
我们没有另一半相陪
we have no one to be with.

396
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,960
但这样并不代表我们是异种
But... that doesn't make us mutants.

397
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,670
这里真正的异种全在漫画书里
The only mutants here are in these comic books.

398
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,520
我们不能再以是否有恋爱对象
We've got to stop defining our self-worth

399
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,550
来定义我们的自我价值
by whether or not we're in a relationship.

400
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,360
知道我放眼过去看到什么吗
You know what I see when I look around?

401
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,570
我看到一屋子了不起的人
I see a room full of great people.

402
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,710
我们别再跟自己过不去了
So let's give ourselves a break.

403
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,180
我们是一个联盟
We are a community,

404
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,650
只要我们团结在一起
and as long as we have each other,

405
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,800
我们就不是寂寞的
we're never truly alone.

406
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,590
真是不错
That was cool.

407
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,060
你说的那些话
What you said.

408
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,660
你真这样想吗
You really think so?

409
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,910
是的
Yeah, I do.

410
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,230
谢谢
Thank you.

411
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,980
你想不想
Would you like to, uh...

412
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,210
去喝杯咖啡
get a cup... A cup of coffee or...?

413
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,860
好的
Okay.

414
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,190
哥先走一步了  废柴联盟
Later, losers!

415
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,090
喂
Hello?

416
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,200
又是急诊
Another medical emergency?

417
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,040
这次他又怎么了
What's wrong with him now?

418
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,430
我严重怀疑他是不是真被虎纹捕鸟蛛咬了
I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider.
直译名为中国鸟蜘蛛

419
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,760
一个肿块怎么可能有亚洲感
