00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,240
Xbox 360 Kinect游戏  《舞蹈中心》 歌曲  -  YMCA

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,250
跟上舞步啊  霍华德
Try to keep up, Howard!

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,910
哥舞力全开呢
I'm killing it!

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,390
真希望我们在舞厅跳舞时
Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,430
跟现在一样帅
as we do right now.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,310
别担心  你们在舞厅跳舞时
Don't worry, this is exactly how you look

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,200
就是你们现在这副样
when you're dancing in clubs.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,690
女士们  不用谢
You're welcome, ladies.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,870
超大新闻啊  男士们
Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen!

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,330
兄弟
Dude!

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,840
我正要上前舞翻那骚妞呢
I was about to Bollywood this bitch.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,040
早先
Earlier today,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,310
我邀请了史蒂芬·霍金教授与我玩
I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,550
风靡网络的小游戏《填字游戏》
in the popular online game Words with Friends.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,840
跨平台的知名线上填字游戏
游戏名字还有  与朋友谈话/吵架[填字]的意思

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,900
他刚刚同意了我的游戏邀请
Moments ago, he accepted my request.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,290
你们知道这代表什么意思吗
Do you understand what that means?

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,270
霍金教授正在地球上的某处说着
That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying,

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,060
"靠
"Damn it.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,250
我本来是要按拒绝的"
I meant to click no."

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,730
我来解释给你们听吧
I'll walk you through it.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,430
这游戏可不是叫"与陌生人玩填字"
The game is not called Words with Strangers.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,000
也不是叫
No, it's not even called

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,780
"与相识的人玩填字"
Words with Acquaintances.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,910
而是叫"与...
It is called Words with...

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,090
我才不接你的话
I'm not finishing your sentence.

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,270
哥舞翻全场时  你居然关我游戏
You pulled the plug on my funk.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,150
"与朋友"
Friends!

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,850
是"与朋友玩填字"游戏
It's Words with Friends!

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,260
代表着我与霍金正式成为朋友了
Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are.

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,950
只要再拥有个双层床与溜滑梯
Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide;

32
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,350
我六岁时就许下的愿望
I'll have everything I've ever wanted

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,020
就全都圆满了
since I was six years old.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,860
谢尔顿  那挺好啊
That's really nice, Sheldon.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,770
我也替你开心
I'm happy for you.

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,590
我也替你开心
And I'm happy for you, too.

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,090
因为你现在成了
You are now friends with someone

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,560
史蒂芬·霍金朋友的朋友
who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
慢慢乐吧  同志们
Enjoy it, boys.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,310
可能是你们人生的最高点啊
You may have peaked.

41
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,100
谢尔顿  我也认识史蒂芬·霍金
Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking.

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,000
我与他共事过
I worked with him.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,770
等哪天出了款
And if they ever come out with a game called

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,440
"与曾共事过的人玩填字"的游戏
Words with People You Once Worked with,

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
才轮你上场
you'll be off to the races.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,880
谢尔顿  玩个游戏也不代表...
Sheldon, I don't think this actually means...

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,490
话别说太早
Hold that thought!

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,250
"霍金教授下了一步"
Professor Hawking has made a move.

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,670
哎哟妈呀
Boy, oh boy.

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,470
要不了多久
Oh, it's only a matter of time

51
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,480
我们俩就会开始互取好玩绰号了
before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other.

52
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,370
他喊我"鸡笼弟"
I'll be Coop.
库伯Cooper的coop  也有笼子  鸡笼的意思

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,230
我叫他"轮子哥"
He'll be Wheels.

54
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,640
前提是他不介意的话啦
If he's okay with that.

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
好的
All right.

56
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,630
开大空调吧
Crank up the AC, boy!

57
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,710
哥要热翻全场啦
It's gonna get hot in here!

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,450
生活大爆炸 第六季第六集

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,410
今早我洗了个澡
So, I was taking a shower this morning,

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,620
洗完出来  就拿起了旁边
and when I got out, I started to dry off with

61
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,930
看似浴巾的东西擦身子
what I thought was a towel

62
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,010
结果发现那是霍华德他妈的内裤
but turned out to be Howard's mom's underwear.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
害我得重洗了一次澡
I had to take another shower.

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,570
但洗了也没用
It wasn't enough.

65
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,250
洗得了身子  洗不去创伤
Nothing will ever be enough.

66
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,770
有一次我瞧了谢尔顿的内裤抽屉
I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer.

67
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,110
被他骂了
He yelled at me.

68
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,700
但那份内裤的记忆将永存我心
But now I know what it looks like

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,990
他收不回也抢不走
and he can never take that away.

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
这下面有本书呢
There's a book under here.

71
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,490
我自己捡吧
Oh, I'll get that.

72
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,090
-不用  我捡到了  -别  那是...
- I got it. I got it. - No, no, it's...

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
你怎么会有一本历史课本啊
Why do you have a history textbook?

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,600
没什么啦
It's not a big deal.

75
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,720
我就去了帕萨迪纳社区大学上课嘛
Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.

76
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,860
这很好啊
That's great.

77
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,460
我都不知道你还想再读书
I didn't know you wanted to go back to school.

78
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,930
只是上个历史课啦
It's just one history class.

79
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,060
当年没读完大学
Look, I didn't finish college,

80
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,270
就想说再试一下
so I thought I would give it a try.

81
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,690
反正你的演艺事业
Not to mention, your acting career

82
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,900
也如同佘曼将军  一路向南[失败]
is going south like Sherman.
威廉·特库姆塞·佘曼
美国南北战争中的北部联邦军将领

83
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,120
翻你的历史课本就懂了
Read about it in your book.

84
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,780
为什么不好意思告诉我们呢
Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,880
不是的  我是不想让任何人知道
No, I'm not embarrassed. I just didn't want anyone to know

86
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,600
我还没告诉莱纳德嘛
because I haven't told Leonard yet.

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,070
那你为什么不告诉他呢
Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?

88
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,040
他听到他女朋友重回学校
Because it's me going back to school,

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,300
肯定会说"你行的"  "我怎么帮你呢"
and he's gonna be all "You can do it," and "How can I help?"

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
以及"我超以你为荣"
and "I'm so proud of you."

91
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,260
真不敢相信
I just can't believe you could

92
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,860
这么大的事情  你居然瞒着他
keep something like that from him.

93
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,550
你们绝对是我认识最怪的一对情侣了
You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.

94
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,500
是吗
Really?

95
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,080
你想不到更怪的了吗
You can't think of anyone weirder?

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,860
可以啊
I can,

97
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
不过那人就坐在那里呢
but she's sitting right there.

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,640
很好
Yes!

99
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,330
我拼Quiver[箭袋]  配合一个3倍加成
I play the word "Quiver" with a triple letter

100
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,930
以及一个2倍加成  得72分
and a double word score for 72 points.

101
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,270
把你的轮椅胎给打爆了吧  霍金
That ought to let the air out of your tires, Hawking.

102
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,460
我的男朋友与史蒂芬·霍金是朋友
Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking

103
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,110
我的新去屑洗发水味道也不是柏油味
and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar.

104
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,770
真是守得云开见月明了啊  艾米
Everything really is coming up, Amy.

105
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,130
的确挺光荣
It is glorious.

106
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,580
当代最具智慧的人之一
One of the greatest intellects of our time

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,000
同意与我进行智力上的君子之争
has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,970
而且我还虐翻了他
And I'm spanking him so hard

109
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,490
估计他带的研究生也要被他虐翻了
his grad students won't be able to sit down.

110
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,130
当一名男性彻底压制另一男性时
You know, when one male dominates another,

111
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,890
他的睾丸酮会上升
his testosterone level rises.
睾丸酮是一种雄性激素
有维持男性第二性征和性欲的作用

112
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,770
说这个干嘛
What's your point?

113
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,990
想到你会有睾丸酮就兴奋嘛
It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.

114
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,650
我的好友史蒂芬
My friend Stephen

115
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,470
拼了Act[行动]  得18分
just played the word "Act" for 18 points.

116
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,340
是的  我现在直呼他名字
That's right, I call him Stephen now.

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,710
我问过他了  他不接受"轮子哥"的绰号
Because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,310
你可以把他的Act连成Extract[提取]
Oh, you could turn his "Act" into "Extract,"

119
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,530
这样的话分能加倍
and it would be for double points.

120
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,760
艾米
Amy.

121
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,420
你干嘛直接告诉我一个答案呢
Why would you give me a word?

122
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,440
如果我拼了这个字  我就是作弊
Now, if I play "Extract," it would be cheating.

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
抱歉
Sorry.

124
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,740
不过我可以填一个完全不相关的
Although, I could play the completely unrelated

125
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,140
更好字眼Extract[萃取物  一字多义]
and better word "Extract."

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,610
成功避免道德难题
Ethical conundrum avoided.

127
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,770
谢谢你  大脑
Thanks, brain.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
意大利面好吃吗
Spaghetti okay?

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,790
很"脆"
It's crunchy.

130
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
我就爱这样的
Just the way I like it.

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
好啦  那水我也觉得没烧开
Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
挺好的  我很喜欢啦
It's great. I love it.

133
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,450
听着  我有事情要告诉你
Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you.

134
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,880
我考虑重返校园有一段时间了
I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now.

135
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,020
所以一个月前
So a couple months ago,

136
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,850
我在一家社区大学报读了历史课
I started taking a history class at the community college.

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,970
这真是太棒了  棒极了  超棒的
That's great! Great, great, great!

138
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,810
干嘛拖这么久才告诉我呢
Why wait so long to tell me?

139
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,650
因为我不想你小题大作
I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.

140
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,380
你为什么会这样想我呢
Why do you think I'd be like that?

141
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,470
我懂  你报了一门课  很好啊
I get it, you're taking one class. It's nice.

142
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,250
如果一切顺利
Maybe if it goes well,

143
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,760
可以再报一门  然后变成全日制学生
you take another, you enroll full-time.

144
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
对了  记得注意下
Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,460
哪些学分是能转修成四年制大学的
which credits transfer to a four-year college.

146
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,660
你现在就是在小题大作
You're making it a big deal.

147
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,390
抱歉  那随便吧
Sorry. Whatever.

148
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,820
都好
It's all good.

149
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,350
总之  就是这样
Anyway, that's it.

150
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,930
我就觉得该知会你一声
I just thought you should know.

151
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,190
我能问问课上得怎么样吗
Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?

152
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,160
相当不错
It's really good.

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
我们在学有关奴隶的起源
We've been talking about the origins of slavery.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
明天就要上交我第一篇论文
Turn in my first paper tomorrow.

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
好主题  我可以帮你
Great topic. I can help with that.

156
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,900
你可以从很多不同的观点来论述
There are lots of different perspectives you can take:

157
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,760
比如经济  社会  政治
economic, sociological, political...

158
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,590
喂  这是我的论文
Hey, this is my paper.

159
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,490
我的观点就是  奴隶是坏事
And my perspective is that slavery is bad.

160
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,480
我的教授是黑人
Oh, and my professor's black,

161
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,670
所以我确信这就是正确的答案
so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.

162
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,150
-我能看看吗  -不行
- Can I take a look? - No,

163
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,750
莱纳德  这是我的东西
Leonard, this is my thing.

164
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,290
-好吧  我知道了  -多谢理解
- Okay, I get it. - Thank you.

165
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,430
这像我开始练引体向上时
It's like when I started doing chin-ups;

166
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,610
做不到一个前  我都没脸让你看
I didn't want you to see until I could do one.

167
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,210
顺便说一声  差点就成功了
FYI, really close.

168
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,230
谢谢
Thank you.

169
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,860
现在给我乖乖地吃饭
Now behave yourself and eat your dinner.

170
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,970
晚点  运气好的话
Maybe later, if you're lucky,

171
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,840
你或许可以跟一个大学生上床哟
you get to sleep with a college girl.

172
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,910
真的吗
Really?

173
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,110
我念了四年大学
'Cause I went to four years of college

174
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,720
五年研究生院  这种好事一次都没发生过
and five years of grad school, that never happened once.

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,050
下次我跟在印度的客服中心讲话时
I think the next time I have to speak to a call center in India,

176
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,640
我要试着用美国口语
I'm going to try using an American accent.

177
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,330
为什么
Why?

178
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,480
因为用正常声音说话
Because when I use my regular voice,

179
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,760
我会觉得我好像在逗他们玩
I feel like I'm making fun of them.

180
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,810
这理由太可笑了吧
That's ridiculous.

181
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,930
而且你的美国口音烂死了
Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.

182
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,840
伙计  我的口音超棒的
Dude, my accent is brilliant.

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,450
我白皮肤的美国朋友们
Hey, my snow-white American friends,

184
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,320
让我们把牛肉放上烤肉架
let's put some cow meat on the barbecue

185
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,770
然后猛吃  直到吃成死胖子
and eat it until we're all obese.

186
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,150
你其实是像这样
This is what you sound like.

187
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,590
我觉得我在用美国口音说话
I think I'm talking in an American accent,

188
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,810
但听起来却是
but it really sounds like

189
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,860
我正戴着一副不合嘴的假牙说话
I'm wearing a set of giant dentures.

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,820
谢尔顿  我听起来真的像那样吗
Sheldon, do I really sound like that?

191
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,120
告诉他就是那样
Tell him he sounds like that.

192
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,060
谢尔顿  你没事吧
Sheldon, you okay?

193
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,170
这都三天了
It's been three days.

194
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,000
为什么史蒂芬·霍金还没拼一个字
Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?

195
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
那家伙是天才
The guy's a genius.

196
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,890
或许你对他来说  挑战性不够
Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.

197
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,100
不够挑战性
Not challenging?

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,930
我把他虐爆了好吗
I was humiliating the man.

199
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,600
我还在想出一本书  名叫
I was thinking of writing a book called

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,920
《时间简史之
A Brief History of the Time
《时间简史》的作者为霍金本人

201
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,810
我让史蒂芬·霍金痛哭流涕》
I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.

202
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,670
这就是问题所在
There's the problem.

203
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,510
你不能这样打败霍金
You can't beat Hawking like that.

204
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,750
他讨厌输
He hates to lose.

205
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
大家都知道他脾气跟小孩一样
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,620
他不应该坐轮椅  他应该坐婴儿车才对
I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.

207
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,470
真的吗
Really?

208
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,360
有次我跟他共事时
One time when I was working with him,

209
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,370
他说强尼·戴普有参演《黑客帝国》
he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix.

210
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,280
我告诉他记错了  可他仍死命坚持
I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting.

211
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,780
于是我把再网上查出来的结果给他看
So I looked it up online and showed him.

212
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,590
然后第二天  他举办了个披萨派对
Well, the next day, he had a pizza party,

213
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,150
大家都被邀请了  唯独我没有
and everyone got invited but me.

214
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,740
然后他就说
And then he was all,

215
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,950
"可能你的邀请函丢在母体里了吧"
"Your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."

216
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,030
上帝啊  我都做了什么啊
Good Lord, what have I done?

217
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,220
上帝啊  我都做了什么啊
Good Lord, what have I done?

218
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,320
烂死了
Terrible.

219
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,960
好吧  高手  那你说印度口音试试
All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.

220
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
我不能坐上那头大象
I can't sit on that elephant,

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,790
因为吃了咖喱  我火烧火燎地想拉肚子
my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.

222
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,690
好吧  说得真好
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

223
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,550
拜托是篇好论文
Please be good.

224
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,550
拜托是篇好论文
Please be good.

225
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,060
好吧
Okay.

226
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,960
她写作煮饭一样烂
She writes like she cooks.

227
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,140
拼字
Play.

228
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,570

你在干嘛
What are you doing?

232
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,860
试图用绝地念力
Trying to use a Jedi mind trick

233
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,470
来控制斯蒂芬·霍金
to control Stephen Hawking.

234
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,570
拼字
Play.

235
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,660
他肯定头戴着防念力锡纸帽什么的
He must be wearing a Tin foil hat or something.

236
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,570
我做了件坏事
I did a bad thing.

237
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,880
-会影响到我吗  -不会
- Does it affect me? - No.

238
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,830
那你默默忍受吧
Then suffer in silence.

239
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,590
拼字
Play.

240
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,790

241
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,000
史蒂芬·霍金...
Stephen Hawking...

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,070
史蒂芬·霍金...  史蒂芬·霍金
Stephen Hawking... Stephen Hawking.

243
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,570
佩妮报读了一个班
Penny started taking a class.

244
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,460
她写了篇论文  但不给我看
She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it,

245
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,330
但我背着她偷偷看完了
I went behind her back and I read it anyway.

246
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,550
史蒂芬·霍金讨厌我
Stephen Hawking hates me.

247
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,170
我不知道怎么办才好
I don't know what to do.

248
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,940
她那论文写的糟透了
I mean, the paper's terrible.

249
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,990
但如果我告诉她  她就知道我看过了
But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it

250
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,430
她一定会很生气
and she'll get really mad.

251
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
我把他虐得太惨
I was beating him so bad,

252
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,470
他不想跟我做朋友了
he doesn't want to be friends anymore.

253
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,580
大家都喜欢我  为何史蒂芬·霍金不这样呢
Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?

254
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,620
咱俩讨论的貌似不是同一件事吧
Is it possible we're having two different conversations?

255
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,410
我怎么知道  我又没听你说什么
How would I know? I'm not listening to you.

256
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,880
等一下
Hang on.

257
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,970
有了
Okay.

258
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,920
我们接下来这么干
Here's what we're gonna do.

259
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,050
赛棋钟
Chess clock.

260
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,470
我们每人有5分钟说自己的麻烦
We each get five minutes to talk about our problems.

261
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,220
轮流说
We'll take turns.

262
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,900
每一轮包括自我陈述
Each turn will consist of a statement

263
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,980
以及朋友提出的有益建议
and a helpful response from the friend.

264
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,730
计时开始
Begin.

265
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,650
我在《填字游戏》中虐了史蒂芬·霍金
I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends.

266
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,800
结果他不玩了
He stopped playing.

267
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,460
现在我们已不再是朋友了
And now we're not friends anymore.

268
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,450
他可能很忙呢
He's probably busy.

269
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,520
你没必要担心
You're worried about nothing.

270
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,430
再给他几天时间
Give it a couple more days.

271
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,190
他会玩的  你就会发现一切都没事
I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine.

272
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,780
到我了
My turn.

273
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,740
我不能让佩妮交这么一篇烂论文
I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper,

274
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,530
但我如何告诉她这件事
but how do I tell her it's bad

275
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,630
又不让她知道我已经看了呢
without letting her know that I read it?

276
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,650
这难倒我了  现在...
Beats me. Now...

277
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,590
我知道霍金根本没在忙
I know Hawking's not busy

278
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,640
因为我能看到他在跟其他人玩呢
because I can see he's playing other people right now.

279
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,650
也许你太强了
Maybe since you're so good,

280
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,210
他得花时间去思考该怎么下
he's taking his time to meet the challenge.

281
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,700
我希望佩妮能享受在学校...
I want Penny to enjoy school...

282
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,950
沃罗威茨告诉我他是个大孩子
Wolowitz told me he's a big baby!

283
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,350
但我又不知道这事
But I didn't know that,

284
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,470
我连成了"Extract"这个词  得了82分
and I played "Extract" for 82 points.

285
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,760
都是艾米的错  她让我拼这词的
It's all Amy's fault. She told me to play it.

286
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,690
我得跟她割席断交
I have got to cut her loose.

287
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,200
谢尔顿  我还没说完呢
Sheldon, I wasn't done talking.

288
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,250
她明天就要交论文了
She hands in the paper tomorrow.

289
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,180
我知道我帮得了她
I know I could help her.

290
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,610
她是我女朋友...
And she's my girlfriend...

291
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,410
她  她应该准我帮她
I-I should be allowed to help her.

292
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,850
为什么就不准我帮她呢
Why aren't I allowed to help her?

293
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,460
我懂你的烦恼  兄弟
Yeah, I hear you, brother.

294
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,730
不行
No.

295
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,450
你需要给我点建议
You need to give me some advice.

296
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,360
行啊  女人嘛  是吧
Fine. Women, huh?

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,090
不行...
No...

298
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,080
要针对我的情况给建议
Specific to my situation.

299
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,720
金发女人嘛  是吧
Blonde women, huh?

300
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,450
设身处地的建议
Empathetic!

301
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,930
-算你倒霉呗  -我不玩了
- It sucks to be you. - I quit.

302
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,260
莱纳德  等下  不要嘛
Leonard, wait. No.

303
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,470
我都听完了你的蠢事
I listened to your dumb thing.

304
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,620
莱纳德  快回来
Leonard, come back.

305
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,810
莱纳德  快回来
Leonard, come back.

306
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,210
莱纳德  快回来
Leonard, come back.

307
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,520
-干啥  -难怪呢
- What? - Oh, of course,

308
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,450
只有意志薄弱的人才会被操控
it only works on the weak-minded.

309
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,510
早安  阳光小美女
Good morning, sunshine.

310
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,830
莱纳德
Leonard.

311
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,560
才早上8点
It's 8:00 a.M.

312
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,910
相当于三更半夜啊
It's like the middle of the night.

313
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,940
我知道  但我得去上班了
I know, but I have to go to work,

314
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,870
我给你做了早餐
and I made you breakfast.

315
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,770
哇哦  这太贴心了
Oh, wow, that's so sweet.

316
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,080
-这是什么  -在你打开之前
- Hey, what's this? - Uh, before you open that,

317
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980
我想问你  听过一个童话叫
um, are you familiar with the story of

318
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,270
"精灵和鞋匠"吗
"The Shoemaker and the Elves"?

319
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,530
精灵吗  拜托  莱纳德
Elves? Come on, Leonard.

320
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,620
-现在看《指环王》也太早了吧  -不  不
- It's too early for Lord of the Rings. - No, no.

321
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,740
听我说
Listen, um...

322
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,630
很久很久以前  有一个鞋匠
Once upon a time, there was this shoemaker

323
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,450
他晚上上床睡觉后
and when he went to bed at night,

324
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,830
精灵们会偷偷地
elves would sneak in

325
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,100
趁他入睡时  做漂亮的鞋子给他卖
and they would make all these amazing shoes for him.

326
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,930
当鞋匠第二天一早醒来时
And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning,

327
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,130
他...他会非常开心
he-he would be super happy,

328
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,140
一点也不责怪小精灵们
not mad at the elves at all.

329
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,810
打开吧
Open it.

330
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,030
好吧
Okay.

331
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,740
1619至1865年  南北战争前
"An examination of the economic, cultural,

332
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,540
从经济  文化  政治分析
and political roots of slavery

333
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,090
旧南方地区奴隶制度的根源
in the Old South: 1619 to 1865."

334
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,650
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell is this?

335
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,790
别问我  是一个小精灵做的
Don't ask me. A little elf did it.

336
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,950
让我理理清楚
So let me get this straight.

337
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,180
你没看就猜我的文章会很糟
You just assumed my paper would be bad

338
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,550
所以你写了份新的给我吗
so you wrote one for me?

339
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,440
不  我猜你的文章会很棒  所以我看了
No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.

340
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,340
-什么  -不是  我...
- What?! - No, I...

341
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,340
我是说  的确不错
I mean, it was good.

342
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,610
只是还有点地方需要稍加润色
There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.

343
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,920
-什么啊  你把每个词都改了  -那不是事实
- W... You changed every word. - That's not true.

344
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,340
"奴隶制"
"Slavery."

345
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,470
"1619年"
"1619,"

346
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,900
还有上面你的名字  都是你写的呀
your name at the top-- that's all you.

347
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,690
你真是个混蛋
You are such an ass.

348
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,190
这就是为何我报读时
This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you

349
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,990
没第一时间告诉你的原因
I was taking a class in the first place.

350
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,690
请别生气  我只是...
Please don't be upset. I-I just...

351
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,930
我只是不希望你得分太低
I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade

352
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,900
然后灰心丧气  就不再想
and get discouraged and give up on the idea

353
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
继续学业了
of going back to school.

354
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,230
是哦  因为我上学
Right, because me being in school

355
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,730
对你来说太重要了
is so important to you.

356
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,940
这样的话  你约会的对象就不仅仅
That way, you wouldn't have to be dating someone

357
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,310
是个服务员
who's only a waitress.

358
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,940
拜托  你知道我不是这个意思
Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

359
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,480
是吗  听好了
Do I? Listen to me.

360
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,140
读书这事得靠我自己
I need to do this on my own.

361
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,280
挂科就挂科  及格就及格
If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass.

362
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,350
你明白了吗
Do you get it?

363
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,070
抱歉  我只是想帮忙
I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.

364
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,040
下次别帮了
Yeah, well, next time don't.

365
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,020
还有  既然你这么喜欢讲故事
Oh, and since you like stories so much,

366
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,150
这不是《鞋匠与精灵》  明白吗
this is not "The Shoemaker and the Elves," okay?

367
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,260
这是  "给人一条鱼  他就吃了
This is, "Give a man a fish, he eats it.

368
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,710
教会他捕鱼  他...
Teach a man to fish, he...

369
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,710
会卖鱼什么的"  随便啦  我不知道
sells it or something." Whatever, I don't know!

370
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,060
那也比你强多了  你个大混蛋
It's just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!

371
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,090
霍金那边有消息吗
You ever hear back from Hawking?

372
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,850
没有
No.

373
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,140
看来我失去他这朋友了
It would appear as if I've lost him.

374
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,130
笨大脑
Stupid brain.

375
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
没事的
It'll be okay.

376
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,210
怎么会没事
How can it be okay?

377
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,860
史蒂芬·霍金是天才
Stephen Hawking's a genius

378
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,730
说话又跟机器人一样
and he talks like a robot.

379
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,520
这可是我理想中的完美朋友
It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend.

380
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,160
但如果他这人输不起
Yeah, but if he's a sore loser,

381
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
没这个朋友也罢
maybe you're better off without him.

382
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,350
有道理
You're right.

383
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,260
我想我只有尽力把你俩变成柠檬水了
I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you.
生活给了你柠檬[苦难] 你就把它变成柠檬水[幸福]

384
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,540
他拼字了  他拼字了
He played! He played!

385
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,830
鸡笼弟和雷霆之轮哥又和好了
Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again.

386
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,410
他对这个绰号没意见
He was okay with that nickname.

387
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,490
你现在只要放水让他赢就行了
So, now all you have to do is let him win.

388
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,800
早想到了
Way ahead of you.

389
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,280
我会拼"At"[在]
I will play the word "At"

390
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,050
获得微不足道的两分  输掉比赛
for two measly points, throwing the game

391
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,560
以巩固我和
and thus securing my friendship

392
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,550
世上最聪明的人的友谊
with the smartest man in the world.

393
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,200
你等什么呢  提交答案啊
What are you waiting for? Hit "Send."

394
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,470
下不了手
I can't.

395
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,190
故意放水是智慧上的欺诈
Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.

396
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,130
那就别这样
So don't do it.

397
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,040
可我想做霍金的朋友
Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.

398
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,340
那就快发啊
So do it.

399
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,280
但如果这样做  我就是个伪君子
No, but if I do, I'll be a phony,

400
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,410
没节操
a sellout,

401
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,170
像好莱坞明星一样假
a Hollywood poser.

402
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,350
那就别这样做
Then don't do it.

403
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,460
我不会
I won't.

404
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,950
这样感觉才对
This feels right.

405
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,810
我妈总是说  对自己要诚实
My mother always said, "to thine own self be true."

406
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,920
好样的
Good for you.

407
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,630
她也告诉我全世界的动物
'Course she also told me that every animal in the world

408
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,710
上了一条船  她懂什么呀  发送
got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.
诺亚方舟

409
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,200
几天没见到你了
Haven't heard from you in a couple days.

410
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,210
你还在生我的气吗
You still mad at me?

411
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,440
没
Nope.

412
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,510
我没有理由
I have no reason to...

413
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
生你的气[谐音be mad at you]
"B" mad at you.

414
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,710
B-
Minus.

415
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,650
没错  我的论文
That's right. On my paper.

416
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,380
不是你的  是我的得了B-  你这个混蛋精灵
Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.

417
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,390
我不知道说什么好
I don't know what to say.

418
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,840
这样说
Hmm, how about,

419
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,610
"老天  佩妮  你比我想象中要聪明
"Gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought.

420
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,240
虽说上学的是你
You may be the one in school,

421
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,330
但学到一课的是我
but I'm the one who learned a lesson.

422
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,100
我好蠢  佩妮  真滴"
I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh..."

423
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,140
她学你学得惟妙惟肖啊
She sounds exactly like you!

424
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,250
莱纳德有啥反应
How'd it go with Leonard?

425
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,350
我想他不会再犯这种错误了
I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.

426
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,390
太好了
Good.

427
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,450
我知道我这是多此一举
So, I know this goes without saying,

428
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,820
但如果你们告诉莱纳德
but if either of you tell Leonard

429
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,020
你们帮我重写了论文
you helped me rewrite this paper,

430
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,270
我会用一袋橙子打爆你们俩
I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.

431
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,010
-知道  -明白
- Got it. - Understood.

432
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,650
姐妹们  这次论文得了B-
Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper.

433
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,300
我认为如果我们一起努力
I think if we put our heads together,

434
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,570
下次就会得个A
on the next one we could get an "A."

435
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,540
可我们是故意让你得B-的  这样才可信
Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.

436
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,740
可信
Believable?

437
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,280
你是说我不聪明吗
You saying I'm not smart?

438
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,740
-不是  -你很聪明
- No, no! - You're smart.

439
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,290
这还差不多
That's better.

440
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,160
感觉我又回到了高中
I feel like I'm in high school again.

441
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,100
对  帮舞会皇后做功课  这样她才喜欢我们
Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.

442
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,000
是啊
I know.

443
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,650
这招终于管用了
It's finally working.

444
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,400
是史蒂芬·霍金
It's Stephen Hawking.

445
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,500
快接  我想听
Answer it. I want to hear.

446
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,840
霍金教授
Professor Hawking,

447
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,570
很高兴你打电话过来
how nice of you to call.

448
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,600
你好
Hello.

449
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,620
我玩游戏玩得很开心  库珀博士
I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.

450
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,280
我也是
Oh, me, too.

451
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,110
还是该叫你窝囊废博士呢
Or should I say Dr. Loser?

452
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,750
哈哈哈
Ha, ha, ha.

453
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,540
是的  恭喜你
Yes, congratulations.

454
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,510
你是实至名归的赢家
You won fair and square.

455
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,600
非常厉害  先生
Uh, very impressive, sir.

456
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,580
你喜欢"脑筋急转弯"吗
Do you like brain teasers?

457
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,400
我爱玩"脑筋急转弯"
Oh, I love brain teasers.

458
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,370
谢尔顿·库珀
What does Sheldon Cooper

459
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,750
与黑洞有什么共同点
and a black hole have in common?

460
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,930
都很烂[吸力]
They both suck.

461
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,270
气死你  气死你
Neener neener.
