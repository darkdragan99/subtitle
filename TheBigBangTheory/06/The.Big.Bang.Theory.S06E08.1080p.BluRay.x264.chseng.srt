1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,150
你在画什么呢
What are you drawing over there?

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,830
设计能为通往平行宇宙的
A hypothetical containment field

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,930
飞盘大小的虫洞
for a frisbee-sized wormhole

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,940
做为防护措施的安全禁锢场
that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,940
你个小笨蛋呆瓜
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,580
许多科学家认为
You know, a lot of scientists believe

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,310
与其他生命体有接触
that making contact with other life-forms

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,510
可能对人类造成巨大灾难
would probably not end well for us.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,800
莱纳德  飞盘大小的虫洞而已
It's a frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,780
用飞盘就能堵上了  别紧张
You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,780
你是想我帮你造出来吗
Do you expect me to build this?

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,530
我是想你擦擦嘴角的布丁  大家再见
I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,530
你们有注意到谢尔顿每天
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,250
都会准时在2点45分不知去向吗
always disappears every day at 2:45?

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,220
是吗
Really?

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,780
他可能只是去拉大号吧
He probably just goes to the bathroom.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,780
他拉大号的时间是早上8点
Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at 8:00 A.M.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,940
没拉干净  则下午1点45再一趟
With optional follow-ups at 1:45

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,600
周五吃高纤维  晚上7点10分还拉
and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,630
你居然都能记得了  真悲哀
It's sad that you know that.

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,030
这只是我悲哀的冰山一角呢
Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,950
我在看他公布的行程表
I'm looking at his public calendar.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,940
2点45到3点05  没行程
2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,530
昨天同一时间  没行程
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,890

Last week, nothing.

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,130
上个月  这时间也没行程
Last month, nothing.

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,900
他总是把这段时间给空出来
He never has anything booked during that time.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,900
每天都有着不为人知的20分钟
20 minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,870
我们应该查查他到底上哪了
We should figure out where he goes.

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,770
好兴奋刺激哦
Ooh, this is exciting.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,830
跟我举办的
Like one of my classic

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,770
神秘谋杀游戏晚餐派对一样
murder mystery dinner parties.

33
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,500
是啊  那派对谋杀了我
Right, the case of who murdered

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,920
三个美好的周六夜晚
three Saturday nights of my life?

35
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,190
库萨帕里上校在厨房中用橄榄渣杀的人
Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
谋杀推理桌游中  大家要猜出凶手  凶器  以及行凶地点

36
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,820
是高档橄榄酱
It was tapenade

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,890
你们俩去死吧
and you guys suck.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,240
生活大爆炸 第六季第八集

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,050
今天工作如何
So, how was work today?

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,950
我整个下午都忙着在生成
Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing

41
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,720
同位素纯水晶来探测微中子
isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,140
听起来很有意思啊
That sounds like fun.

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,000
是啊  没错
Yeah, it was.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,080
那就好  我猜对了
Oh, good, I guessed right.

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,370
在跟谁发消息呢
Who you talking to?

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,240
就学校的一个同学啦
Oh, just this guy I met at school.

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,800
行  我们还是情侣  对吧
Oh, great. We're still dating, right?

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,980
别乱想  只是朋友而已
Relax. He's just a friend.

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,350
我们要一起做口头报告
We're doing an oral report together.

50
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,370
他人很好啦
He's really nice.

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,360
抱歉  你刚说什么
I'm sorry, what was that?

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,180
我刚听到"口"字  微中风了一下
I had a little stroke after "oral."

53
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,590
你别乱想了
Would you stop?

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,770
人家只是刚从伦敦搬来啦
Look, he just moved here from London, okay?

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,050
他还没什么其他朋友
He doesn't really know anybody.

56
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,210
爽了  有英国腔的
Oh, good, an English accent,

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,770
-史上最性感的腔了  -才没有
- the sexiest accent you can have. - No.

58
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,670
才不是这样呢
That's not true.

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,610
还有法国腔  意大利腔
There's French, there's Italian.

60
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,570
好啦  你说得对  英国腔最棒
No, you're right, it's the best.

61
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,390
跟他说你有男朋友了吗
Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?

62
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,870
没谈到这话题
It didn't come up.

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,230
你跟他说嘛
Well, maybe you should tell him.

64
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,790
你要我怎么突然开口啊
What am I supposed to say?

65
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,340
就说  "现在没空聊
Say, "can't talk right now.

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,620
跟我男人在一起
hanging with my boyfriend.

67
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,160
英国去死  你去死  美国第一"
England sucks, you suck, USA number one."

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,770
行
Fine.

69
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,040
"跟我男人在一起
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

70
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,730
之后聊"  满意了吗
Talk to you later." Happy?

71
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,900
满意  谢谢
Yes. Thank you.

72
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,410
-他回了什么  -没什么
- What did he say? - Nothing.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,980
说啊
What?

74
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,380
"是你男人逼你打出那段话的吗"
"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

75
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,180
我讨厌这臭家伙
I hate this guy.

76
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,890
别这样嘛
Don't be like that.

77
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,820
拜托  相信我  他肯定是在泡你
Come on, trust me, he's hitting on you.

78
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,290
他才没泡我  我们只是朋友
No, he's not. We're just friends.

79
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,650
跟他搭档你会不开心吗
Look, is this gonna be a problem?

80
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,320
约好了他明天过来弄报告呢
Because he's supposed to come over tomorrow to work.

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,620
不是吧  来你家啊
Really? Here?

82
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,330
如果你会心里不舒坦  我可以换搭档
If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch partners,

83
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,060
虽然下周就得上台报告
even though the thing's due next week

84
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,080
而且大家都选好了固定搭档了
and everyone already has a partner

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
但为了你  挂科就挂科吧
and I'll probably end up failing the class.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
太好了  谢谢你啊
That'd be great. Thank you.

87
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,540
2点44分  分秒不差
2:44, right on schedule.

88
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,890
谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

89
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,450
你们好啊
Oh, hello.

90
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,360
拉杰跟我要去基因实验室
Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,370
摸摸夜光小兔子
to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

92
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,140
-想跟我们一起去吗  -不用了  谢谢
- Want to come with us? - No, thank you.

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,650
你确定吗  关上实验室灯光
Are you sure? They turn off the lights,

94
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,930
那就是小型激光秀呢
and it's like a cute little laser show

95
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,950
差别只是它们会到处拉屎
that poops all over the place.

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
我确定  先走啦
I'm quite sure. Good day.

97
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,260
你要去哪啊
Well, where are you going?

98
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,760
-你们要去哪呢  -才刚告诉你啊
- Where are you going? - We just told you.

99
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,460
-我也才刚告诉你们  -你压根没说
- I just told you. - No, you didn't.

100
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,670
公说公有理  婆说婆有理  法庭见吧
Well, it's your word against mine; see you in court.

101
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,580
我们该跟踪他吗
Should we follow him?

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,240
不知道啊  我好纠结啊
I don't know, I'm torn.

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
既想知道他都上哪去
I want to know where he's going,

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,580
可又好想去摸摸小兔兔
but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,920
你们好啊
Hi, guys.

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,980
艾利克斯  你知道你老板上哪去了吗
Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?

107
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,730
不知道
No.

108
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,160
你应该知道他的行程吧
Don't you know his schedule?

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,560
他只交代  灯芯裤摩擦声太吵
All I know is corduroy makes too much noise

110
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,030
让我去换件"安静点的裤子"
and I have to go find "quieter pants."

111
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,530
来吧
Come on.

112
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,390
我愿意付出一切
Boy, what I wouldn't give

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,100
只求她能脱下裤子
to get her out of those pants...

114
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,550
换上一件更潮的裤子
and into something a little more stylish.

115
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,180
他就是来这里啊
This is where he goes?

116
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,590
里面有什么啊
What's in there?

117
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,680
这是旧储藏间吧
I think it's an old storage room.

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,800
什么事能让他每天躲在里面弄20分钟啊
What could he be doing in there every day for 20 minutes?

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,550
肯定不是"20分钟练腹肌运动"
Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs,

120
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,440
他要是有做的话  腹肌绝对好很多
because if he were, he would have way better abs.

121
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,000
-能听到什么吗  -没呢
- Can you hear anything? - Not yet.

122
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,050
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

123
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,070
我也听啊
I'm listening.

124
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,540
你不能脸朝另一边听吗
Can't you face the other way and listen?

125
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,980
我做什么你都看不顺眼  是吧
I can't do anything right for you, can I?

126
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,110
他到底躲里面干啥呢
What the hell is he up to?

127
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,810
他是个怪人
He is kind of a weirdo.

128
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,480
说不定把伦纳德·尼莫伊五花大绑在里面
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there.
伦纳德·尼莫伊  星际迷航中的主要演员

129
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,540
或比尔·盖茨
Or Bill Gates.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,270
甚至是史提芬·霍金呢
Or Stephen Hawking.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,460
史提芬·霍金有什么好五花大绑啊
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

132
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,310
霍华德  你不能因为人家是残疾人
Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently

133
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,010
就差别待遇啊  歧视是不对的
just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

134
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,440
你要是对于
If you're wondering why

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,540
我为何要直盯着窥视孔外有疑惑
I've been staring through the peephole,

136
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,690
我是要看看那个
I'm trying to get a look at this guy

137
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,340
要来佩妮家的男人
who's coming over to Penny's.

138
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,620
老实说  我都没注意到你在那边
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,410
不是什么大事啦
It's not a big deal.

140
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,790
他只是她历史课的同学
He's just in her history class.

141
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,260
他们要一起弄报告
They're working on a project together.

142
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,730
我干嘛这么紧张兮兮啊
I don't even know why I care.

143
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,000
好吧  我不管了
You know what, I don't care.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,820
自欺欺人而已
You think you don't care.

145
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,010
这样太蠢了
This is silly.

146
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
我没什么好担心的
I have nothing to worry about.

147
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,560
这可说不准
Oh, I don't know.

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,130
从数据上来看
Statistically speaking,

149
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,230
我肯定你的确有要担心的事
I'm sure you have something to worry about.

150
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,610
什么意思
What do you mean?

151
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,040
假设你的外貌是算中等
Well, if we assume your looks are average,

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
随便一算
right off the bat,

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,110
地球上有一半的男人比你还有魅力
50% of men on Earth are more attractive than you.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,780
代表着有15亿帅气男子在等着
That's 1.5 billion handsome lads standing by,

155
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,360
浇熄你们的爱火呢
waiting to rain on your parade.

156
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,060
但爱情不是只看外貌啊
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.

157
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,590
我也有很多部分是高于平均值啊
I'm way above average in a lot of other things.

158
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,680
绝非在身高  视力  运动能力
Not height, vision, athleticism,

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
或消化乳制品这几个领域吧
or ability to digest dairy products.

160
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,610
我是重要的项目赢别人啊
I'm talking about important things

161
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,800
例如感情成熟度
like emotional maturity.

162
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,940
你刚还从那小孔想探查你女友
You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.

163
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,140
我还是比较喜欢你以为我不在那会
I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.

164
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,420
我也不是说你就没有吸引人的优点
I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities.

165
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,660
你的择友能力无懈可击
Your choice of friends is impeccable,

166
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,150
睡觉安稳不吵闹
you're a good sleeper.

167
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,550
再提一点
And last but not least,

168
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,980
你懂得买我喜欢的那种葡萄
you buy the grapes I like.

169
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,030
你也算是乘龙佳婿了
You're a real catch

170
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,810
大胜那些睡觉打鼾
compared to some snoring guy

171
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,440
满冰箱垃圾葡萄的人了
with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,900
无所谓啦
None of this matters.

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,610
我相信佩妮在乎我
I trust that Penny cares about me,

174
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,670
她也不会跟这男的有什么
and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

175
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,320
如果他是催眠大师  那可说不准
Well, unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

176
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,490
什么
What?

177
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,450
虽然很难碰上  但也不是不可能啊
While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility.

178
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,680
她现在可能正
She might be performing

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,380
无意识的与他发生性行为呢
sexual acts with him and not even know it.

180
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,800
你扯过头了吧
Now you're just being ridiculous.

181
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
你确定吗
Am I?

182
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,570
人的意识是很神奇的  莱纳德
The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

183
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,110
那男的可能正一边"爽歪歪"
He could be having the time of his life

184
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,850
而佩妮只以为自己是吃玉米的鸡呢
while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.

185
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
瞧咱俩  大半夜鬼鬼祟祟的来这里
Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night

186
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,400
像是一对飞贼一样
like a couple of cat burglars.

187
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,370
我们比较像忍者吧
I think we're more like ninjas.

188
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,600
我不想当忍者  人家想当飞贼
I don't want to be a ninja; I want to be a cat burglar.

189
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,110
行  我当忍者  你当飞贼
Fine, I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.

190
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,970
不行  咱俩得一样
No, we both have to be the same thing.

191
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,750
好吧  我们都是忍者
Okay, we're ninjas.

192
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,280
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,020
但下次我们要一起当飞贼哦
But next time, we'll be cat burglars.

194
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,420
-上锁了  -你确定吗
- It's locked. - Are you sure?

195
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,960
我当然确定
Yes, I'm sure.

196
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,730
你去把风  我来...
Now, you stand guard, I'm going to...

197
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,300
锁上了
It's locked.

198
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,070
去把风就行了
Just keep an eye out.

199
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,040
我很快就能弄开了
I'll have this open in a minute.

200
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,110
你什么时候学的开锁啊
When did you learn how to pick locks?

201
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,170
我中学那会开始学的魔术嘛
When I was starting to do magic in junior high,

202
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,750
当时我想当个逃脱魔术师
I thought I could be an escape artist

203
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,520
像逃脱大师胡迪尼一样
like Harry Houdini.

204
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,550
后来如何了
How did that work out?

205
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
挺不错啊
Pretty good.

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
朋友  人缘  以及我家方圆12英里内
I managed to escape friends, popularity,

207
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,720
所办的任何派对  都"逃脱"我而去了
and every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
开了  准备好进去了吗
There. Ready?

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
-慢着慢着  -干嘛
- Hold on, hold on. - What?

210
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,900
谢尔顿是个非常聪明的人
Sheldon is a very smart man,

211
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,060
而且显然他想守住这个秘密
and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

212
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,410
是啊  那又怎样
Yeah, so?

213
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,280
万一有机关陷阱怎么办
What if it's booby-trapped?

214
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,010
别担心  我早就想到了
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

215
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,510
那好  你有什么计...
Great, what's your pl...

216
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,820
没事吧
Are we good?

217
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,690
没事
Yeah.

218
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,370
43
Forty-three.

219
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,900
这到底是什么意思呀
What the hell does that mean?

220
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,400
我不知道
I don't know.

221
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,220
方程式的答案吗
The solution to an equation?

222
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,470
可能是
Maybe.

223
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,890
它是质数
It's a prime number.

224
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,080
加密系统就是基于素数的函数
Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.

225
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,440
谢尔顿有什么秘密是需要加密的啊
What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?

226
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,070
他的鸡蛋沙拉啊
He's always been very cagey about

227
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,160
他一直对让其美味的秘方三箴其口
what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

228
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,020
其实就是红辣椒
It's paprika.

229
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,940
真的吗
Really?

230
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,360
好吧  解决了一个谜题
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

231
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,130
晚安
Okay, good night.

232
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,990
谢谢啦  科尔
Thanks, Cole.

233
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,570
-学校见  -再见
- See you at school. - See you.

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,610
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

235
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,360
我以为你早走了呢
I thought you left a long time ago.

236
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,450
你好吗
What's up?

237
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,670
你要搬到五楼的公寓住吗
You moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?

238
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,270
不  我是来看朋友的
No, I was just visiting a friend.

239
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,310
好吧
Oh, cool.

240
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,970
那个四楼的金发美女吗
That cute blonde on four?

241
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,110
对  你认识她吗
Yeah. You know her?

242
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,290
我见过她
I, well, I see her around.

243
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,530
我习惯跟她保持距离
I like to keep my distance

244
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,900
因为她男人超可怕的呢
because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.

245
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,970
-真的吗  -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

246
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,550
他是帮派份子
He's ganged up.

247
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,840
她跟我说  他是一名科学家
She told me he's a scientist.

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,380
那是他帮派的名字
That's the name of his gang.

249
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,330
"科学家"
The Scientists.

250
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,220
他们丧心病狂啊
They are crazy.

251
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,840
谢谢你的忠告
Well, thanks for the tip.

252
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,980
别客气  兄弟  别轻举妄动哦
No problem, brother. Stay frosty.

253
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,320
我们还是情侣  对吧
We're still dating, right?

254
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,940
你好呀  霍夫斯塔德博士
Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,040
艾利克斯  叫我莱纳德吧
Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard.

256
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,570
霍夫斯塔德博士是我爸
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

257
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,910
还有我妈
And my mother.

258
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,640
我姐
And my sister.

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,930
跟我们家的猫
And our cat.

260
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,220
虽然我很确定
Although, I'm pretty sure

261
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,550
靴猫·霍夫斯塔德博士的只是荣誉学位
Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary.

262
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,220
能一起坐吗  莱纳德
May I join you, Leonard?

263
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,090
-当然  -谢谢
- Sure. - Thanks.

264
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,560
艾利克斯  我问件事
Hey, Alex, let me ask you something.

265
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,430
我女朋友在学校认识个男的
My girlfriend knows this guy at school.

266
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,900
他有英国腔
He's got an English accent.

267
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,220
我爱死英国腔了
Ooh, I love English accents.

268
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,300
是啊  你们女人都爱
Yeah, you all do.

269
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,120
总之我觉得他在追她
Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.

270
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,020
她说他只是待人友善而已  让我相信她
She says he's just being nice and that I should trust her.

271
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,680
应该没事的
It's probably harmless.

272
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,430
你也懂的嘛
You know how it is.

273
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,830
我相信您肯定常有人追
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

274
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,930
是啊
Right.

275
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,140
因为女孩子都会这样
Because girls are always like,

276
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,250
"那家伙有两套《星际迷航》的制服
"Ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms

277
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,610
而且耳部还经常受感染
"and gets a lot of ear infections.

278
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,780
我得把他搞到手啊"
I got to get me some of that."

279
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,630
我不知道
I don't know,

280
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,380
我敢说肯定常有人暗恋你
I bet it happens more than you realize.

281
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,880
相信我  真的没有
Trust me, it doesn't.

282
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,270
你确定吗
You sure?

283
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,270
你可爱又风趣
You're cute, you're funny.

284
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,990
说不定正有人追你  你却浑然不知
Maybe you're getting hit on, and you don't even know it.

285
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,460
真的吗
Really?

286
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,090
我挺确定呢
I'm pretty sure

287
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,070
好了  我得回去干活了
Okay, I got to get back to work.

288
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,560
谢谢你听我说
Thanks for listening.

289
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,670
没关系
No problem.

290
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,820
希望不会有妹子在半路冲上来把我扒光啊
Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.

291
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,090
快想  我们都是聪明人
Come on, we're smart guys.

292
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,650
-我们一定能想出来  -43
- We can figure this out. - Forty-three.

293
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,160
什么是43
What is 43?

294
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,420
除了我妈妈脖子的尺寸
Besides my mom's neck size.

295
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,210
是锝的原子序数
It's the atomic number for technetium.

296
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,480
那玩意有放射性
That stuff's radioactive.

297
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
你觉得他是在造炸弹吗
Do you think he's building a bomb?

298
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,750
他花了两年时间才拼好
It took him two years to put together

299
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,600
乐高的积木死星  我不担心这个问题
that Lego Death Star; I'm not worried.

300
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,030
会不会是这个呢
Ooh, this could be something.

301
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,290
43是半杯
43 is the number of calories

302
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,150
无脂肪酸奶的卡路里数
in half a cup of fat-free yogurt.

303
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,630
你为什么会知道这个
Why would you know that?

304
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,350
抱歉
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,340
不是每个人胡吃海喝  都能像你那样不长肉
We can't all eat whatever we want and still stay thin.

306
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,340
等等  在《银河系漫游指南》中
Wait, in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,
英国作家道格拉斯·亚当斯的著名科幻小说

307
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,180
生命  宇宙和一切问题的答案
isn't 43 the answer to the question

308
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,280
不正好是43吗
of life, the universe, and everything?

309
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,280
那是42  蠢货
That's 42, dumb-ass.

310
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,050
好伤人哦
Feelings.

311
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,860
我们别再猜了
We should stop.

312
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
-我已经精疲力竭了  -我也是
- I'm exhausted. - Yeah, me, too.

313
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,430
我们还有更重要的事要做
We've got more important things to do.

314
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,190
谁在乎这个傻逼43是什么意思
Who cares what stupid 43 means?

315
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,450
-我不在乎  -我们回家吧
- Not me. - Let's go home.

316
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,900
想去吃点东西吗
You want to get something to eat?

317
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,590
好主意
Sounds good.

318
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,400
43到底是个啥玩意
What the balls is 43?!

319
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,680
老子一定要猜到
I have to know!

320
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,380
你不是应该和你的帮派混在一起
Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang,

321
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,460
在大楼的墙上涂鸦方程式吗
spray painting equations on the side of buildings?

322
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,380
别这样  对不起
Come on, I'm sorry.

323
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,960
我只是不敢相信你居然不信任我
I just can't believe you don't trust me.

324
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,570
我当然信任你
I do, of course I do.

325
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,500
那为什么让我在朋友面前丢人
Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend,

326
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,060
对了  他完全知道你是谁
who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?

327
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,060
-真的吗  -你的照片就贴在我家冰箱上
- Really? - Your picture's on my refrigerator.

328
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,660
我真的开始讨厌这家伙了
You know, I'm really starting to not like this guy.

329
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,990
你什么毛病啊
What is your problem?

330
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,530
上班时把脑子用没了
Do you use up all your thinking at work

331
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,800
回家后就只剩空脑壳了吗
and then have none left over for when you get home?

332
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
我不知道
I don't know.

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,690
有时候真的挺难受的
It's hard sometimes.

334
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,060
你去哪里
Everywhere you go,

335
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,050
都有男人想追你  哪怕我就站在旁边
guys hit on you, even if I'm standing right there.

336
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,390
而且他们都比我高
And they're all taller than me.

337
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,730
为什么每个人都比我高
Why is everyone taller than me?

338
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,280
这种事在我脑子里挥之不去
You know what, this is all in my head.

339
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,970
这是我的问题  不是你的
It's my problem, not yours.

340
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,650
莱纳德  你怎么总是这样
Leonard, why do you always do this?

341
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,520
听我说  我是和你在一起
Listen to me, you're the one I'm with.

342
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,750
你知道我爱你  别胡思乱想
You know I love you, so will you please relax

343
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,780
我快被你逼疯了
because you're driving me crazy.

344
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,470
这是你第一次说你爱我
You know that's the first time you ever said that you love me.

345
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,450
是的
Yeah.

346
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,890
我们要装作没什么大不了的吗
We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal?

347
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,520
这
That's...

348
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,230
正是我们要做的  因为
exactly what we're gonna do because...

349
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,190
你害我要哭鼻子了
you're about to make me cry,

350
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,000
我们都知道  如果我开始哭
and we both know if I start crying,

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,510
你也会开始哭
you're gonna start crying.

352
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,550
-没错  你该走了  -好的
- You're right, you should go. - All right.

353
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,120
她爱我
She loves me.

354
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,020
"你好  我是艾利克斯
"Hey, it's Alex.

355
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,200
很高兴和你一起喝咖啡
Nice having coffee with you.

356
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,980
如果你想继续聊天  我随时有空
If you want to talk more, I'm always available.

357
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,380
笑脸  笑脸"
Smiley face, smiley face."

358
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,620
这女生真友善啊
What a friendly girl.

359
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,240
有画面了
Okay, picture's up.

360
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,040
摄像头运作正常
Looks like the camera's working.

361
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,580
视频的清晰度真高啊
That's good quality video.

362
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,950
那当然  这是"火星漫游者"的备用摄像头
It better be. It's the spare camera for the Mars rover.

363
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,250
你是怎么弄到手的
How did you get your hands on that?

364
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,950
百万元的摄像头
Million dollar camera--

365
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,750
十块钱的锁
ten dollar lock.

366
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,960
我的天  他来了
Oh, my God, here he comes.

367
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,690
答案即将揭晓
This is it.

368
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,900
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell is that thing?

369
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,170
不知道
I don't know.

370
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,710
我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

371
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,670
实验日志
Experimental log.

372
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,410
虫洞制造器第44次测试
Wormhole generator test 44.

373
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,250
虫洞制造器测试
Wormhole generator test?

374
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,370
之前的43个平行宇宙
The first 43 parallel universes

375
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,160
经我查证空空如也
I've checked proved to be empty.

376
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,710
我看没原因怀疑
I see no reason to suspect

377
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,730
第44号宇宙会有任何的不同
universe number 44 will be any different.

378
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,770
上帝啊
Oh, my God!

379
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,680
我的老天爷
Holy crap!

380
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,540
它在吃我的脸
It's eating my face!

381
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,290
那个东西在吃他的脸
It's eating his face!

382
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,550
我发现了摄像头  调包了视频讯号
I found your Webcam and replaced the video feed.

383
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,840
你们俩应该为自己的行为感到羞耻
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

384
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,460
谢尔顿  真的对不起
Sheldon, we're really sorry.

385
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,570
真的对不起
Yeah, really sorry.

386
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,940
对不起
Sorry?

387
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,370
你们可能没意识到
You may not realize it,

388
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,900
但我每天的生活  都有不易驾驭的方面
but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life.

389
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,640
得理解讽刺的言语
You know, understanding sarcasm,

390
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,210
假装对他人的事感兴趣
feigning interest in others,

391
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,050
不能随心所欲地谈论火车
not talking about trains as much as I want to.

392
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,320
这让我心力交瘁
It's exhausting.

393
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,280
正因如此  每天有20分钟
Which is why, for 20 minutes a day,

394
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,080
我要去那个房间
I like to go down to that room,

395
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,420
什么都不想
turn my mind off

396
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,790
做自己喜欢的事来充电
and do what I need to do to recharge.

397
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,890
但你都在里面干嘛呢
But what are you doing in there?

398
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,490
43到底是什么意思
And what does 43 mean?

399
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,930
你们不需要知道
You don't need to know,

400
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,460
你们不配知道
you don't deserve to know,

401
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
你们永远都不会知道
and you will never know.

402
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,400
至少我知道你的鸡蛋沙拉是怎么做的了
Yeah, well I know how to make your egg salad now.

403
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,260
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four,

404
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,400
五  六  七  八
five, six, seven, eight...

405
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,290
见鬼
Drat.

406
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,700
看来是再也踢不到43下了
I'm never going to get to 43 again.

407
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,720
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four...

408
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,640
讨厌
Rats.
