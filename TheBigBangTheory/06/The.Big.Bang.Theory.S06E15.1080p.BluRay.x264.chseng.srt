1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,870
真不知道我这些年来
I don't know why I avoided

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,270
为什么不看哈利波特系列小说
the Harry Potter books for so long.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,550
写得很不错啊
These are great.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,170
我刚开始看第六册
I just started number six.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,720
那本挺好看的
That's a good one.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,660
邓布利多在这一本里死了
Dumbledore dies in that one.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,150
我懂你的感觉  我当初也没料到
Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,570
你干嘛说出来啊
Why would you say that?

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,830
你开始了一个话题
You brought up the subject.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,290
然后我回以与话题有关的有趣讯息
I contributed an interesting fact on that subject.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,530
这就叫聊天的艺术啊
It's called the art of conversation.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,190
换你说了
Okay, your turn.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
你这是超级大剧透啊
That was a huge spoiler.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,130
灰常好
Good.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,710
你这人有病啊
What is wrong with you?

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,980
换做是我剧透  你肯定会叽歪一整周
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,160
不是吧  莱纳德
Oh, really, Leonard?

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,270
你的小暴脾气又要发作了吗
Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,160
小暴脾气  我有小暴脾气吗
Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,790
没错  而且我还得出个推论
Yes, and I have a theory why.

21
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,320
因为你的乳糖不耐症
Because of your lactose intolerance,

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,040
所以你用豆奶替代牛奶
you switched over to soy milk.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,670
而大豆含有类雌激素的化合物
Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds.

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,950
你的可可球加豆奶早餐
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs

25
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,230
把你变成了一个歇斯底里的八婆
are turning you into a hysterical woman.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,540
你还真够极品啊
You are unbelievable.

27
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,060
我干嘛要这么忍你
I don't know why I put up with you.

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,100
又是控制狂  又超级欠扁
You're controlling, you're irritating...

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,270
又开始叽叽歪歪了  叽叽  歪歪  叽歪
There you go again-- nag, nag, nag.

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,400
越叽歪越显得我说得对哦  小三八
You're only proving my point, little lady.

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,310
谢尔顿  滚你丫的
You know what? Screw you, Sheldon.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,770
你是我这辈子见过最烦人的人了
You are the most annoying person I have ever met.

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,170
什么  我哪里烦人了
What? I'm annoying?

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,440
明明是你整天对我的言行意见超多
You criticize my behavior all the time.

35
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,530
"谢尔顿  吃早饭时别提你排便的事"
"Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast."

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,460
"谢尔顿  我们大学校长
"Sheldon, when the president of the university

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,010
在丧礼上念悼词时
is giving a eulogy at a funeral,

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,550
别打哈欠外加指手表催他"
don't yawn and point at your watch."

39
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,510
"谢尔顿  不要觉得我衣服难看
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts

40
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,680
就把它们拿去丢了"
'cause you think they're ugly."

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
你才难搞好吗
You're impossible.

42
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,910
够了  我没必要...
That's it. I don't...

43
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,100
我没必要忍这些极品事
I don't have to put up with this.

44
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,550
事实上  从你在室友协议上签名的那天起
Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement

45
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,080
你就注定得忍受
that says you do.

46
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,170
这就是我对室友协议的意见
Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.

47
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,730
-你马上给我捡起来  -不要
- You pick that up right now. - No.

48
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,180
室友协议第27章  第五段写明
Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5:

49
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,170
室友协议书  与美国国旗一样
The roommate agreement, like the American flag,

50
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,210
都不许落地
cannot touch the ground.

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,970
懒得鸟你
I don't care.

52
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,180
我才懒得管你说了哪些屁话呢
I don't have to do anything you say because...

53
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,340
我以后不想住这里了
I don't think I want to live here anymore.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,540
-你要上哪去  -去跟佩妮住
- Where are you going? - To live with Penny

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,990
不跟你这傻逼混球住了
and not you, you crazy bastard.

56
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,130
-你骂我傻逼混球  -没错
- Crazy bastard? - Yes.

57
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,040
-莱纳德  等等  -干嘛
- Leonard, wait. - What?

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,180
小精灵多比在第七册也死了
Dobby the elf dies in book seven.

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,150
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十四集

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,770
还你
Here you go.

61
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,520
太好啦  进来吧
Great. Come on in.

62
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,840
连句谢谢都不说吗
What, you don't say thank you?

63
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,240
这本来就是我的
It's my suitcase.

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
我两年前借给你的
I lent it to you two years ago.

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,720
行  那我告诉你吧
Well, then, I should tell you

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
我把轮子跟手把都弄坏了
I broke the wheel and the handle.

67
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,400
伯纳黛特全公司的人
So, is everyone from Bernadette's company

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,340
都要去赌城玩吗
going to Vegas?

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,440
没  就我跟她  以及一些高层
No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,550
-这是她公司的额外奖励啦  -不错
- It's part of a bonus she got. - Cool.

71
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,580
她是研发出某种疾病的解药之类的吗
Did she discover a cure for something?

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,670
不算是啦
Not exactly.

73
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,570
他们公司砸大钱研发出一种治疗头皮屑的药
They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication

74
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,920
而那个药的副作用是导致严重拉稀
that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,770
难道拉稀还能是好事吗
Is there a good anal leakage?

76
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,820
反正是妮妮的主意
Anyway, it was Bernie's idea

77
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,750
让公司把这药物当成治便秘的药物销售
to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,410
好一条赚钱路子[做柠檬水]啊

79
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,740
靠人家做巧克力软糕[拉屎]赚钱
You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,570
-我有件事想请你帮忙  -说吧
- Hey, I got a favor to ask. - Sure.

我妈被之前好上的那牙医抛弃之后
My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck

82
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,570
心情就落到了谷底  郁郁寡欢
since that dentist she was dating dumped her.

83
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,050
抛弃她  得用叉车才能吧
Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift?

84
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,810
对不起
Sorry.

85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,760
不应该取笑病态肥胖的人
There's nothing funny about morbid obesity.

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,890
她肥爆了  是很好笑啦
She's huge. It was funny.

87
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,820
我是希望呢
Anyway, I was just hoping

88
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,910
你明晚能去她那里  看看她
that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night

89
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,560
确保以下她没事
and make sure she's doing okay.

90
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,980
兄弟  我可是黄金单身汉
Dude, I'm a single man.

91
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,350
周六夜是我的狂欢夜呢
Saturday night is my party night.

92
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,810
是吗  你有什么安排
Really? What do you got going on?

93
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,870
不知道  可能开车去好莱坞那里
I don't know, maybe drive down to Hollywood,

94
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,590
去几个泡妞圣地转转  看有无妹子上钩
hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.

95
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,990
告诉我这个场景你是否似曾相识
Okay, tell me if this sounds familiar.

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,690
你花了15块停车费
You pay $15 to park,

97
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,450
然后站在人行道一个小时犹豫
you stand on the sidewalk for an hour

98
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,940
直到你忍不住  然后给了门卫
until you break down and give the bouncer

99
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,090
20块门票费  让你进去
20 bucks to let you in.

100
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,230
你努力挤到吧台
You push your way to the bar,

101
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,710
喝杯18块的大都会鸡尾酒
where you drink an $18 cosmopolitan,

102
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,030
然后盯着一个美女
then you stare at a pretty girl

103
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,800
在脑海中幻想你们一起的美好人生
and imagine your perfect life together.

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,310
幻想你们的孩子  孙子
Your children, grandchildren.

105
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,740
然后看着她被自称是电影
Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims

106
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,900
《比佛利拜金狗》编剧的男人给泡走
he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

107
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,890
然后你就自暴自弃
Then you give up on anyone ever loving you,

108
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,320
跑去连锁派店买了个派
go to Marie Callender's, buy a pie

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,990
然后回到停车场  在车上默默吃掉它
and eat it in your car in the parking lot.

110
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,970
我明天该几点到你妈家来着
What time should I be at your mother's?

111
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,530
我跟她说你晚上7点到
I told her around 7:00.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,270
我发誓  那家伙是我这辈子见过
I swear, that man is the most egotistical,

113
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,860
最傲慢自大  最难以忍受的人类
insufferable human being I have ever met.

114
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,380
话是没错  但你们这对很有爱呢
Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple.

115
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,170
《芝麻街》的两个木偶角色
同住在一起  虽然经常吵架但又很快和好
就像伯特和厄尼
Like Burt and Ernie.

116
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,580
你们俩甚至还教我词语和数字

《芝麻街》是美国家喻户晓的儿童教育节目
教授基础阅读算术 颜色的名称 字母和数字等基本知识

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,090
我受够了  真的够了
Well, I've had it. I am done.

118
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,380
我连跟他同住多一分钟都忍不了
I can't... I can't live with him for one more minute.

119
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,210
那你打算去哪里住
Where are you going to go?

120
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,250
来这里跟你住啊
I was thinking here with you.

121
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,580
有问题吗
That a problem?

122
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,950
没有  完全没有
No, not at all.

123
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,620
真没  这样很好啊
No, it's-it's great.

124
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,750
简直太棒了
It's terrific. I...

125
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,970
我只是忍不住替谢尔顿难过而已
You know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon.

126
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,820
我是觉得...
I mean...

127
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,900
他没有你怎么活啊
how's he going to get by without you?

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,180
厄尼
Ernie.

129
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,100
他现在有艾米了
He's got Amy now.

130
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
的确  但不一样的啦

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,790
为什么
Why?

132
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,380
好吧  这么说吧

Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,800
而抛弃哈利啊
dating Ron's sister?

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,500
哈利和金妮在一起了啊
Harry and Ginny get together?

137
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,950
抱歉  剧透警告
Sorry. Spoiler alert.

138
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,660
我的重点是  尽管我很想跟你住在一起
My point is, as much as I want to live with you,

139
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,360
但谢尔顿需要你  我不能这么自私
I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
拜托  他唯一需要我的地方是
Please, the only thing he needs me for

141
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,770
当他的替罪羔羊
is to be his whipping boy,

142
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,070
他的傀儡和出气筒
his-his stooge, his doormat.

143
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,660
人家不是都说 "不要没事找事嘛"
Well, you know what they say: if it ain't broke...
源自谚语"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
意思是不要随便改变现状  小心弄巧成拙

144
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,370
听起来似乎你不想咱俩住在一起
It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.

145
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,160
不  不是  我想
No. No, no, I do.

146
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,770
我当然想  只是...
I do. It's just...

147
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
这可是很重要的一步
I mean, it's a really big step.

148
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
是吗
Is it?

149
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,070
我们总是在一起
We're together all the time.

150
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,660
钱方面来看  同住好处多多啊
Financially, it makes great sense.

151
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,780
你能想出一个我们不该住在一起的理由吗
Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?

152
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,880
这个嘛...
Well... um...

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
-我突然有点口渴  -喝吧
- I'm just a little thirsty. - Yeah.

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,030
想不到
I got nothing.

155
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,690
很好  我去收拾东西
Great. I'll go get my stuff.

156
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,420
好
Good.

157
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,220
好吧  别慌别慌
Okay, all right, don't freak out.

158
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,950
你能搞定这件事的
You can make this work.

159
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,530
你能帮我在浴室整理出一个架子放东西吗
Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom?

160
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,670
我每天要吃超多药
I take a lot of medicine.

161
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,060
拜托一定要有抗焦虑的药
Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.

162
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,400
准备好要吃甜点了吗
Are you ready for dessert?

163
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,390
不了  谢谢  沃罗威茨太太
No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.

164
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,870
老实说  我撑得都要抱着肚子走出去了
As it is, I'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here

165
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,780
就像消防员小心翼翼地救出婴儿那样
like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.

166
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,180
拜托
Oh, please.

167
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,270
你是个又高又瘦的帅阿三
You're a tall glass of brown water.

168
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,570
吃了甜点再走吧
Have dessert.

169
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,200
我真的吃不下了
Well, I-I really couldn't.

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,690
但我今晚过得很开心  边吃你炖的牛胸肉
But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket

171
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,880
边听你说你这些年从自己身上
and hearing about the things you've had removed

172
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,310
切除下来的各种东西
from your body over the years.

173
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,970
真不知道原来肿瘤里能长出瘤中瘤
Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.

174
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,780
医生说它们就像俄罗斯的套娃一样
The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls.

175
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,820
如果你坚持要走
Well, if you have to go,

176
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,080
那我把东西打包到一起让你带走吧
how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,420
那真是太好了  谢谢你
That would be lovely. Thank you.

178
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,080
沃罗威茨太太
Mrs. Wolowitz, uh...

179
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,460
你没事吧
are you okay?

180
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,920
别理我
Don't mind me.

181
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,390
我一觉得孤单
I just cry when I'm lonely

182
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,000
没什么活头  就会想哭
and have nothing to live for.

183
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,780
要不...
I, uh...

184
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,260
-要不我吃完甜点再走吧  -太好了
- I suppose I could stay for some dessert. - Great.

185
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,600
-你喜欢吃巧克力碎乳酪蛋糕吗  -喜欢
- You like chocolate chip cheesecake? - Sure.

186
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,770
那我做一个
I'll make one.

《超人漫画》里面的角色

194
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,560
莱纳德和我一起买的
Oh... Leonard and I bought that together.

195
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,020
这是个伦理难题
That's a bit of an ethical conundrum.

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,230
算了  我留着吧
Eh, I'll keep it.

197
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,720
你接下来有什么计划
So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,320
估计我得找一个新室友  然后教化他
Uh, suppose I'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate.

199
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,240
这是一项多么艰巨的任务啊
What a task that will be.

200
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,830
你知道莱纳德一开始进来住的时候多没教养吗
Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?

201
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,620
不知道
No.

202
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,220
废了好大功夫  才让他有固定的如厕时间
Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule.

203
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,310
他以前只要感觉一来  想去就去
He would just go whenever the mood struck him.

204
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,900
-就像小狗整天拉撒  -完全正确
- Like a dog-boy. - Exactly.

205
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,970
假设你能找到一个室友
What if you could find a roommate

既是科学家

207
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,680
同时熟悉并喜欢你的生活方式
and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?

208
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,160
那当然最理想啦
That would be ideal.

209
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,950
如果真有那么一个人存在
If a person like that existed,

210
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,090
我会什么都不问  立马签协议
I would sign on, no further questions asked.

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,010
太好了  那个人近在眼前
Great. Here I am!

212
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,610
等等
Wait.

213
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,600
那个人是谁  眼前是哪里
Here who is where?

214
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,130
我啊
Me.

215
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,720
我难道不是最佳室友人选吗
Aren't I your perfect roommate?

216
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,750
好好想想  谢尔顿
Think about it, Sheldon.

217
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,000
我既不是陌生人
I'm not a stranger,

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,440
我们的智商又是同一等级
we're intellectually compatible,

219
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,610
我愿意开车载你满城转
I'm willing to chauffeur you around town,

220
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,020
还有你个性怪癖
and your personality quirks,

221
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,250
别人会觉得厌恶或烦人
which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing,

222
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,140
而我却觉得超级可爱
I find cute as a button.

223
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,180
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

224
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,930
告诉我一个你觉得这主意不棒的理由
Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.

225
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,570
看  你想不到吧
See? You can't.

226
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,150
我去看看莱纳德的房间
I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room

227
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,570
够不够放我的水床
is big enough for my water bed.

228
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,800
好兄弟莱纳德  好兄弟莱纳德
Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard.

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,730
好兄弟莱纳德
Good buddy Leonard.

230
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,230
干嘛
What do you want?

231
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,220
好兄弟  你好啊
Hey, good buddy.

232
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,300
我刚和艾米聊了聊
So, uh, I was just talking to Amy,

233
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,960
她让我意识到
and she made me realize

234
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,110
我和你这次的小纠纷
that this little dust-up between you and me

235
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,090
根本就不足挂齿
is much ado about nothing.

236
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,810
-是吗  -是的
- Is that so? - Yes.

237
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,000
我原谅你了  回家来吧
All is forgiven, so come back home.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,490
我给你做一杯热巧克力豆奶
I'll make you some soy hot chocolate,

239
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,740
然后再给你说说我们激动人心的

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,260
想拉就拉的如厕新政策
devil-may-care bathroom policy.

241
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,350
-别拐弯抹角了  谢尔顿  -好吧
- Cut to the chase, Sheldon. - Okay.

242
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,360
艾米说要搬进来住
Amy's decided she wants to move in with me,

243
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,450
所以我需要你回家  你个可爱的小调皮
so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp.

244
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,810
头上抹好多东西啊
That's a lot of product.

245
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,690
-怎么了  -是这样的
- What's going on? - Oh, get this:

246
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,490
谢尔顿突然又想让我回去了
suddenly, Sheldon wants me back

247
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,230
因为艾米想搬进去和他一起住
because Amy wants to move in with him.

248
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,450
是吗  真有意思
Really? Interesting.

249
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,360
太晚了  伙计  我哪也不去
Well, too late, pal. I'm not going anywhere.

250
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,430
佩妮和我在一起非常幸福快乐
Penny and I are very happy living together.

251
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,820
对吗
Isn't that right?

252
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,900
就像是幸福要赖在这公寓里不走了呢
It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.

253
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,810
莱纳德  拜托了
Leonard, please.

254
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,290
你知道艾米搬进来就意味着我们要面对
You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy

255
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,920
我们压根没准备好的亲密关系
our relationship isn't ready for.

256
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,120
没错  这事真有其事
Yes! That is a real thing.

257
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,740
这不代表你们不在乎彼此
And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other;

258
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,180
只是这种节奏
it just means things are moving at a pace

259
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,520
让你感到不安  这很正常
you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.

260
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,450
如果他不想和她一起住
Well, if he doesn't want to live with her,

261
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,510
那他就应该当面讲清楚
then he should tell her how he feels.

262
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,690
也许他是不知道要怎样说
Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it

263
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,310
才能不伤害她的感情
without hurting her feelings.

264
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,180
感情
Feelings?

265
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,430
你以为我是嬉皮士在谈情说爱啊  不是的
What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No.

266
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,060
问题是
The problem is,

267
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,030
她说出了一系列我根本无法反驳的
she laid out a series of logical arguments

268
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,100
逻辑论证
that I couldn't refute.

269
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
-这样最糟糕了  对吗  -没错
- That is the worst, isn't it? - Yes.

270
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,530
抱歉  谢尔顿  我无能为力
I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you.

271
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,580
剧透警告
Oh, spoiler alert:

272
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,890
这门要摔你脸上了
this door's about to slam in your face.

273
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
你在这啊
Oh, there you are.

274
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,010
我什么时候能拿到"我们家"的钥匙呀
When do I get a key to our apartment?

275
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,040
你好
Hello?

276
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,450
是我  昨晚和我妈处得怎么样
Hey. How'd it go last night with my mom?

277
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,000
挺好的
Okay, I guess.

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,430
你什么时候走的
What time did you leave?

279
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,150
事实上我还在这
Actually, I'm still here.

280
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,460
什么  你在我家过夜了啊
What? You spent the night?

281
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,420
是啊
Yeah.

282
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,250
晚饭后  我们看了《罗克福德档案》的重播
After dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files,

283
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,830
上世纪70年代的知名电视剧
然后她开了一瓶
and then she opened a bottle

284
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,990
奶油雪利酒  然后不知不觉
of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know,

285
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,840
她就把我哄上你的床睡觉了
she was tucking me into your bed.

286
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,610
你穿的是我的睡衣吗
You wore my pajamas?

287
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,630
你平时到底怎么睡的啊
How do you sleep in these things?

288
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,470
真丝睡衣配绸缎床单
Silk pajamas on satin sheets?

289
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,680
我滑下床三次了都
I slid out of the bed, like, three times.

290
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,910
拉杰什
Rajesh!

291
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
你起来了吗
You up?

292
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,300
准备好吃早饭了吗
You ready for breakfast?

293
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,410
这么好  有早饭
Oh, boy. Breakfast.

294
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,750
拉杰  听我说
Okay, Raj, listen to me.

295
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,870
你得马上走
You need to get out of there.

296
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,570
但我的奶油酒宿醉还没退
But I have a cream sherry hangover

297
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,980
而且我还闻到薄饼卷的味道了
and I smell blintzes.

298
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
如果你现在不走
If you don't leave now,

299
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,810
她就会利用食物和你的愧疚感
she'll use food and guilt

300
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,960
让你后半辈子一直困在那
to keep you there for the rest of your life.

301
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,150
霍华德  别说了
Oh, Howard, stop.

302
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,380
相信我  你不是犹太人
Trust me, you're not Jewish.

303
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
犹太人就是这么收服人的
That's how they get you.

304
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,340
你别说傻话了
You're being silly.

305
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,290
我想什么时候走就能什么时候走
I can leave whenever I want.

306
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,900
是吗  那你的衣服和鞋在哪呢
Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?

307
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,320
在椅子上呢  就在...
They're on the chair, right over...

308
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,760
糟糕[犹太人用语]
Oy vey.

309
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,350
你好  家庭破坏者
Hello, home wrecker.

310
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,100
我怎么了
What did I do?

311
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,310
你给了莱纳德退路
You gave Leonard somewhere to go.

312
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,810
就因为你
Thanks to you,

313
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,750
艾米现在去买情侣浴巾了
Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels.

314
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,370
就好像我真会用上面写有
Like I'd ever dry myself with something

315
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,710
所有格代名词的东西擦身子似的
that has a possessive pronoun on it.

316
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,660
听我说
Okay, listen.

317
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,820
其实我根本不想跟他住
The truth is I don't want him living with me.

318
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,460
太好了  那把他赶出来
Great. Kick him out.

319
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,370
伤他的心  皆大欢喜
Break his heart. Everybody wins.

320
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,240
不  我不想伤他的心
No, I don't want to break his heart.

321
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,150
我爱他
I love him.

322
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,700
但他搬过来让我很措手不及
This is just happening too fast.

323
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,330
这就叫措手不及啊
You think this is fast?

324
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,140
要不了多久我的洗澡间
It's just a matter of time

325
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,120
就能看见艾米掉的腿毛了
before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.

326
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,770
我可见过她的腿
Yeah, and I've seen those legs.

327
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,890
你最好准备点管道疏通剂
You might want to get some Drano.

328
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,380
等一下
Hold on.

329
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,130
如果你不想和莱纳德一起住
If you don't want to live with Leonard,

330
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,360
那你为什么不跟他直说
why don't you just tell him?

331
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,660
你知道他这个人
Well, you know how he is.

332
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,250
又敏感  又感性
He's sensitive and emotional.

333
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,680
那是因为他喝太多豆奶了
That's because he drinks too much soy milk.

334
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,660
不过除了告诉他们事实
Well, I don't know what else we can do

335
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,450
我也想不出其他办法了
but tell them the truth.

336
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,950
看来我们必须得
I suppose there's no choice

337
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,780
面对他们泪如雨下  怒发苛责
but to face the crying, angry accusations

338
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,320
以及尖声绝望的哀嚎
and the high-pitched wails of despair.

339
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,360
对啊
Yeah.

340
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,730
而艾米的反应就不知道了
And who knows how Amy will react.

341
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,530
冰来了
Here's some more ice.

342
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,960
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

343
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
我们脑子进水了吗
What were we thinking?

344
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,690
按正常方式来做不就行了嘛
We should have just done it the regular way.

345
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,670
太阳马戏团里的中国杂技演员
Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil

346
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,770
做起来感觉超轻松啊
made it look so easy.

347
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,000
不过说实话  如果我的腰能弯成那样
Honestly, if I could bend that far,

348
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,290
我还用得着你吗
what would I need with you?

349
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,730
如果你的腰能弯成那样  那咱俩省事多了
If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor.

350
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,120
拉杰  还好吗
Hey, Raj. What's up?

351
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,240
你太对了
You were right!

352
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,470
我逃不掉了
I can't get out of here!

353
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,610
你还在我妈家吗
You're still at my mother's?

354
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,610
我被困在这里了
I'm trapped.

355
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,320
我的衣服已经洗了一整天了
My clothes have been in the laundry all day,

356
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,990
而且钥匙也被她藏起来了
and she hid my keys.

357
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,400
我觉得有可能在她的文胸里
I think they might be in her bra,

358
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,110
因为她走起路来叮当响
because she jingles when she walks.

359
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,040
我该怎么办
What do I do?

360
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,450
你不是希望生命中有个女人吗
Hey, you wanted a woman in your life.

361
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,830
现在如愿啦
Now you got one.

362
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,720
拜托  霍华德  救命啊
Come on, Howard, help me.

363
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,770
拉杰什  宝贝  洗澡水放好了
Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.

364
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,510
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

365
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,560
她不会想帮我洗澡吧
She's not gonna bathe me, is she?

366
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,380
老天  我真希望能告诉你她不会
Gee, I wish I could tell you no.

367
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,750
好吧  再次多谢你帮忙
All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.

368
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,270
但是  霍华德
But, Howard...

369
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,800
我们应该回去救他吗
Should we go back and rescue him?

370
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,540
太迟了
It's too late.

371
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,680
他成人礼[13年后]的时候我们再见吧
We'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.

372
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,620
给你
Here you go.

373
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,580
我买了中式餐回来  跟莱纳德以前买的一样
I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.

374
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,360
-这是宫保鸡丁吗  -是的
- Is it kung pao chicken? - Yes.

375
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,190
-糙米  不是精米吧  -不是
- Brown rice, not white rice? - Yes.

376
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,570
-韩国熟食店买的辣酱吗  -是的
- Spicy mustard from the Korean deli? - Yes.

377
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,720
-我很厉害吧  -没错
- I did good, right? - Yes.

378
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,820
艾米
Amy,

379
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,480
你有没有担心我们住在一起
are you worried that us living together

380
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,310
会令我们之间的神秘感消失呢
will take the mystery out of our relationship?

381
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,050
没有
No.

382
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,840
也是  你哪可能啊
Yeah, why would you?

383
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,210
还有  看这个
Oh, and, uh, check this out.

384
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,630
我擅自作主
I took the liberty of scripting

385
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,470
为我们写了电话答录机留言
a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.

386
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,330
"你好  我是谢尔顿"
"Hello. This is Sheldon."

387
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,730
"我是艾米"
"And this is Amy."

388
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,190
"我们现在不在家"
"We're not home right now."

389
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,190
"因为我们忙着教育大家呢  小子[说唱常用语]"
"'Cause we out dropping science, son."

390
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,150
"请留言"
"Leave a message."

391
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
哔
Beep.

392
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,290
你不能住在这里
You can't live here.

393
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,190
什么  为什么呀
What? Why?

394
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,610
你不喜欢这个留言吗
Is it the message?

395
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,050
我使用都市俚语是为了显得咱们不好惹
I only used urban slang to sound tough

396
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,500
-这样人家不会来偷东西  -不是
- so people wouldn't break in. - No.

397
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,030
不关留言的事
It's not the message.

398
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,470
那是因为什么
Well, what is it, then?

399
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,540
我都是按照你喜欢的方式来做事的
I did everything just the way you like it.

400
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,140
-是的  -那他妈的是怎么原因  谢尔顿
- You did. - Then what the hell, Sheldon?!

401
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,550
我们恋爱超过两年了
We have been going out for over two years,

402
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,850
我对你还不够有耐心吗
and I have been nothing but patient with you!

403
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,570
我看你喜欢的傻缺太空电影
I watch your dopey space movies.

404
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,300
我签署你那荒谬的恋爱合约
I signed your ridiculous contract.

405
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,060
我甚至不再擦润唇膏  因为你说
I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said

406
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,540
那样我的嘴唇看起来太滑了
it made my mouth look too slippery.

407
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,520
你再也找不到
I am the best girlfriend

408
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,870
比我更好的女朋友了
you're ever gonna have.

409
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,850
给我一个为什么我不能住这里的好理由
You give me one good reason why I can't live here.

410
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,780
全是佩妮的错
It's Penny's fault.

411
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,310
什么
What?

412
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,330
她不想和莱纳德一起住
She doesn't want to live with Leonard,

413
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,960
所以他必须回来和我住
so he has to come live here again.

414
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,990
她是我们伊甸园里的毒蛇
She's the snake in our garden.

415
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,850
她是我们不能做亚当夏娃快乐生活的元凶
She's the reason we can't be happy.

416
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,160
艾艾
Hey, Ames. Yeah.

417
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,430
别跟我套近乎
"Hey, Ames," Nothing.

418
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,920
我都已经准备好搬去谢尔顿家了
I was all set to move in with Sheldon,

419
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
现在我知道不行
and now I hear I can't

420
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,890
-因为你不想和莱纳德一起住  -什么
- 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard. - What?

421
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,820
谢尔顿  你说了什么
Sheldon, what did you say?

422
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,250
我说了实话
I said the truth.

423
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,360
你不想和莱纳德一起住  你心知肚明
You don't want to live with Leonard, and you know it.

424
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,920
你什么时候开始不想和我一起住
Since when don't you want to live with me?

425
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,840
别冲我发火
Oh, don't get all huffy.

426
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,420
是你自作主张决定搬进来
You're the one who decided to move in

427
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,800
问都没问过我是否准备好了
without even asking me if I was ready.

428
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,440
我认为应该好好说说这点
Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

429
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,530
既然你这么喜欢说出真相
And since you love the truth so much,

430
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,330
你为什么不告诉艾米你不想和她一起住
why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her

431
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,000
别用我做替罪羊
instead of blaming it on me?

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,580
我以为我们在说另一件事
I thought we were talking about the other thing.

433
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,980
你是个胆小鬼
You're a coward.

434
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,330
好吧  证据的确支持这一论点
Well, the evidence does support that.

435
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,850
来吧  艾米  我们去喝点红酒
Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine

436
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,410
然后吐槽下我们的男朋友有多混蛋
and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.

437
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,710
知道怎样才能让他们明白吗
You know what would show them?

438
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,950
我应该搬来和你一起住
I should move in here with you.

439
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,060
你想不想
Do you want to...

440
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,130
追几集新的《行尸走肉》
catch up on some Walking Dead?

441
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,920
好吧
Okay.

442
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,360
你有看过洛丽死的那集吗
Have you seen the one where Lori dies?

443
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,680
没有
No.

444
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,590
也许她没死呢
Or maybe she doesn't.

445
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,390
咱们来看看吧
Let's find out.

446
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,560
-你想去哪里  -不要
- Where you going? - No!
