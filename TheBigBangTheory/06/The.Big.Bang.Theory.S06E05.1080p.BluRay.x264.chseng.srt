1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,260
斯图尔特
Oh, hey, Stuart,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,580
我有个太空之旅的纪念品要送你
I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,640
霍华德  你真好
Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,940
难说哦  先打开看看吧
Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,910
我的宇航局官方肖像画哦
It's my official NASA portrait.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,920
"致斯图尔特  你的漫画店是店上之店
"To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,970
就像画里的人是人上之人 一样"
Just like the guy in this picture was."

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,810
他还觉得沃尔格林[连锁药店]
For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,530
以及干洗店也是店上之店呢
and the dry cleaners are out of this world.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,950
此言差矣
That's not true.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,020
在沃尔格林时
At the Walgreens,

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,050
我称赞他们的药  "甩众店于九霄云外"
I was "over the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,660
斯图尔特  你开始为万圣节派对做准备啦
Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,410
这可是我每年的泡妞时节呢
Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,990
希望第九次可以手到妞来
Ninth time's the charm.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,700
需要我帮忙吗
Would you like me to help?

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,540
置办派对  我可是有不少锦囊妙计哦
I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,840
谢了  "锦囊妙计"我付不起
Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,950
单纯"妙计"要多少钱
How much for just quois?

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,870
不用担心钱
You know, you don't worry about money.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,380
-钱的事交给我  -真的吗
- I'll take care of everything. - Really?

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,790
对啊  库萨"派"里  顾名思义就是办派对之王啊
Yeah, you'll love it. Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,860
你们知道什么绝不算派对吗
But you know what wasn't a party?

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,540
火箭发射前的一晚
That hotel in Kazakhstan

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,870
我被安排入住哈萨克斯坦的酒店
they put you up in before the launch.

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,830
那可是我待在地球的最后一晚
I mean, it's your last night on Earth.

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,840
还以为会送个黄片频道看看呢
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,280
你发现霍华德可以把任何话题
Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,920
都拿来炫耀去过太空吗
and use it to remind you that he went to space?

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,370
这假设有意思
Interesting hypothesis.

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,920
套用科学的方法
Let's apply the scientific method,

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,190
-做实验证明吧  -没问题
-perform an experiment. -Okay.

33
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,740
霍华德  今晚想去哪里吃饭呀
Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,600
哪里都行  别去太空站就好
Anywhere but the Space Station.

35
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,480
运气好时  也就一包肉饼
On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,250
不过去那里  不为美食
But, hey, you don't go there for the food,

37
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,110
只为美景嘛
you go there for the view.

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,430
太厉害了
It's fascinating.

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,450
让我再试试  看结果是否相同
Let me see if I can duplicate the result.

40
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,810
霍华德  我一直觉得
Howard, I've always thought

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
人们太看轻柠檬了
the lemon was an underrated fruit.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,060
有何高见
Care to weigh in?

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,150
其实还真没有
Not really.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,550
遗憾啊
Oh, well.

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,790
有人笑过联合号太空舱像颗柠檬
You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon.

46
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,190
但好歹它带我上过天  又平安返航
But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.

47
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,710
生活大爆炸 第六季第五集

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,840
能在起司工厂度过闺蜜之夜
Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory.

49
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,090
还有比这更美好的时刻吗
Does it get any better than this?

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,740
希望会有
I hope so.

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,120
提问
Question.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,670
你觉得你丈夫对高领衣服的热爱
Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks

53
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,840
是在缅怀被犹太割礼掉的包皮吗
is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
看样子是没有
It's not getting any better.

55
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,830
是莱纳德
Uch. It's Leonard.

56
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,960
想拉我去买万圣节化装服
He wants to go costume shopping later.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,470
-你不是喜欢过万圣节的吗  -是啊
- I thought you liked Halloween. - I do, it's just

58
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,770
但他想去那个漫画店的派对
he wants to go to that party at the comic book store.

59
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,150
在那里混的很多男的都怪怪的
A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,570
-比如我老公嘛吗  -以及我男朋友吗
- Like my husband? - And my boyfriend?

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,220
艾米  抱歉
I'm, I'm sorry, Amy.

62
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,520
你刚说到霍华德的包皮什么来着
You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,480
少来了  你必须参加那个派对
Nice try, but you have to go to that party

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,290
-因为我们俩都会去  -我会去啊
- 'cause we're going. - Yeah, I'm gonna go.

65
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,400
只是那里并非我心中的欢乐派对
It's just not my idea of a good time.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,170
莱纳德也常牺牲自己  哄你开心啊
Leonard does thing he doesn't like to make you happy.

67
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,500
他是我男朋友  这是他的义务
Yeah, he's my boyfriend. Isn't that, like, his job?

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,740
那你的义务是什么
Then what's your job?

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
给他哄我开心的机会啊
Letting him make me happy.

70
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,330
我觉得感情上
I just think in relationships

71
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,240
你付出多少才能得到多少
you get back what you put into them.

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,690
也不是永远都这样
That's not always true.

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,960
昨晚我对谢尔顿施展了我的迷魂眼
Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look,

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,410
结果他对我解释了
and he responded by explaining how

75
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,550
人类种植稻米的起源
wheat came to be cultivated.

76
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,420
我是可以努力试试啦
I guess I could probably try a little harder.

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,040
你可以从对他的工作表现出兴趣开始
You could start by taking an interest in his work.

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,150
-那有点难度啊  -为什么
- Yeah, that's kind of a problem. - Why?

79
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,350
我搞不懂他做什么工作啊
Not really clear on what he does.

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,260
他是个实验物理学家
He's an experimental physicist.

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,960
这我也不太理解是什么
Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
他提出假设  然后设计实验
He takes hypotheses and designs protocols

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,460
从而验证其正确性
to determine their accuracy.

84
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,650
很好  现在我更搞不懂了
Yeah, you're really just making it worse.

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,460
你想喝什么茶
What kind of tea would you like?

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,190
我想喝  绿茶混柠檬活力茶
I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,590
两茶一杯吗
Two tea bags in one cup?

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,340
又不是在狂欢派对
You're not at a rave.

89
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,500
谢尔顿  我在想件事
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking,

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,870
这次是我们确定关系后
since this is gonna be our first

91
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,040
首次共度的万圣节派对
Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend,

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,330
我想我们准备一套情侣化装服会不错吧
I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.

93
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,500
完全同意
I couldn't agree more.

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,700
真的吗  这不像是
Really? I find that inconsistent

95
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,870
我认识的你会说的话啊
with everything I know about you.

96
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,280
这次恰恰相反
Oh, oh, on the contrary.

97
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,880
情侣化装服可是当情侣少有的
Couples costumes are one of the few benefits

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,690
好处之一呢
of being in a relationship.

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,250
想象一下
Now imagine this:

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,120
你我一同步入斯图尔特的派对
you and I entering Stuart's party

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,280
众人目光聚焦在全美最有爱
and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,660
-最迷人的情侣身上  -是吗
- and glamorous couple. - Yeah?

103
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,950
R2-D2与C-3PO
R2-D2 and C-3PO!
电影《星球大战》里的两个知名机械人角色

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,330
我要扮3PO
Dibs on 3PO.

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,020
谢尔顿  我说情侣化装服
Sheldon, when I said couples costume,

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,430
是指像罗密欧与朱丽叶
I meant like Romeo and Juliet

107
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,540
或是灰姑娘和白马王子
or Cinderella and Prince Charming,

108
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,730
而不是两个机器人
not two robots

109
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,020
而且我根本不喜欢那部白痴电影
from some silly movie I don't even like.

110
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,900
小心说话啊  同志
Okay!

111
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,360
这次我放过你
I'm gonna let that slide

112
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,750
就当你是要喝双茶包而昏了头
because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.

113
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,600
我总是为你牺牲自我
I make compromises for you all the time.

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,850
但就这一次
Just this once,

115
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,940
我们不能找个两个人都满意的方案吗
can't we find something that we're both happy with?

116
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,560
好吧  那打扮成20世纪
Fine. How about one of the most beguiling

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,580
最有吸引力和影响力的一对如何
and influential couples of the 20th century?

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,590
比尔·休利特和戴维·帕卡德是惠普(HP)公司创始人
两者均为男性
休利特和帕卡德
Hewlett and Packard.

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,870
我要扮休利特
Dibs on Hewlett.

120
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,890
干嘛  你想扮休利特吗
What, you want to be Hewlett?

121
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,500
有人在吗
Anybody home?

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,510
稀客稀客啊  你来干嘛
Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing here?

123
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,850
我只顺路过来跟你打声招呼
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.

124
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,650
真是个美好惊喜呀
Oh, what a nice surprise.

125
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,650
你从来没见过我的实验室吧
I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.

126
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,960
对啊  早就该来了
No, I know. It's long overdue.

127
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,760
那你在干嘛呢
So, what ya doing?

128
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,930
最好不是在造机器人女友
Better not be building a robot girlfriend.

129
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,320
当然不是
No.

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,460
不过霍华德在遇见伯纳黛特前
Although Howard was making some real strides

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,570
的确在那领域取得了不少进步
in that area until he met Bernadette.

132
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,880
-什么  你在开玩笑吧  -没有
- What? You're kidding. - Nope.

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,210
电子丽莎3000现在正乖乖待着箱子里
Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box

134
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,000
等着主人来电呢
waiting for the phone to ring.

135
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,520
哇  这里面是什么呀
Ooh! What's going on in here?

136
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,110
别别别  千万别打开看
Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.

137
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,180
干嘛  是秘密吗
What, is it secret?

138
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,930
不  是氮激光器
No, it's a nitrogen laser.

139
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,860
看一眼  你的眼珠就会变成半熟的鸡蛋
It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.

140
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,210
或许你该在箱子上标记一下
Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.

141
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,570
标记在这里
Sign right there.

142
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,100
"危险"  没错  没错
Ah. "Danger," sure, sure.

143
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,120
那个又是什么
Yeah. What's, what's that?

144
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,690
那是集成离子阱
Uh, that is an integrated ion trap

145
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,640
和飞行时间质谱仪
and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

146
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,740
哇  高科技含量
Wow. High-techie-techie.

147
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,210
那这个小玩意是什么
What's this little box?

148
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,000
那是削铅笔机
That is a pencil sharpener.

149
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,760
哦  低科技含量
Ooh, low-techie-techie.

150
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,110
那你现在在研究什么呢
So, what are you working on right now?

151
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,650
-其实还蛮了不起的哦  -是吗
- It's actually pretty neat. - Yeah?

152
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,120
是啊  这是正投影全息显示
Yeah. It's a front-projected holographic display

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,650
加上手指激光跟踪器
combined with laser-based finger tracking.

154
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,030
来  我给你演示
Here, I'll show you.

155
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,930
我们把铅笔放在这里
We'll just put this pencil over here.

156
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,890
削得很尖  刚才的小玩意挺管用
Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.

157
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,010
非常好
Very good.

158
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,540
然后激光会映射出反射面
And then a laser will map the reflective surface...

159
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,290
瞧瞧
and voil?

160
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,650
哇  真是太不可思议了
Wow. That is amazing.

161
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,480
弦理论中  有个基本概念
You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,430
此观点由美国量子物理学家和科学思想家戴维·玻姆提出
宇宙可能是一张全息图
that the whole universe may be a hologram.

163
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,260
这话什么意思
What do you mean?

164
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,840
全息原理提出的观点是
Well, the holographic principle suggests that

165
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,860
人类每天在三维空间感受的一切
what we all experience every day in three dimensions

166
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,540
可能只是宇宙最遥远的地方的
may really just be information

167
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,130
全息投影
on a surface located

168
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,470
我们感受到的宇宙其实是外界的信息
at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.

169
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,970
所以有可能我们的生活
So it's possible that our lives are

170
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,020
真的只是在宇宙这张
really just acting out a painting

171
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,320
最大的画布上表演绘画而已
on the largest canvas in the universe.

172
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,490
怎么了
What?

173
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,670
有时我会忘了你有多聪明
Sometimes I forget how smart you are.

174
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,520
你真应该经常来
You should visit more often.

175
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,250
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

176
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,910
把衣服脱掉
Take off your clothes.

177
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,690
现在啊  在这里吗
What? Here? Now?

178
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,710
-对  你有意见吗  -没有没有
- Yeah. You got a problem with that? - No, no.

179
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,130
真是疯狂啊
It's kind of crazy.

180
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,820
我从来没再实验室搞过
I've never fooled around in the lab before.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,200
-真的没有吗  -有
- Really? Never? - No.

182
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,180
我跟电子丽莎试过
I did have a shot with the Lisatronic,

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,710
但是她的电源延长线不够长
but the extension cord wasn't long enough.

184
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,860
趁我还没忘  我想听听你们
Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus

185
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,030
对万圣节菜单的意见
I've prepared for the Halloween party.

186
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,990
主题是"怪兽食物"
The theme is "Food that goes bump in the night."

187
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,230
"黑森林火腿湖怪兽"
"Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon."
源自恐怖电影《黑湖妖谭》

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,010
酷斯拉芝麻面包
On Sesame seed Bunzillas.

189
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,730
"死蓉面包之夜"
"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?

190
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,840
笑点在"面包"音似"死亡"[英语]
It's funny because "bread" sounds like "dead."

191
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,310
抱歉  但这些都是普通的食物
I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods

192
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,140
不过是名字换成无聊的双关语
with the names bent into tortured puns.

193
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,110
菜色本身完全没有万圣节的感觉
The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.

194
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,590
万圣节的感觉[万圣香肠]
Ooh, Hallow-weenies!

195
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,050
这双关取得不错
That's a good one.

196
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,070
这个跟我的"吸血鬼通心粉"很搭
They'll pair nicely with my "Draculoni and Cheese."

197
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,640
我真是天才啊
How do I do it?!

198
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,680
我突然想起  我打算
That reminds me, I was thinking about

199
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,370
穿我的太空衣去
wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume.

200
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,650
但我觉得大家可能会说
But then I realized everyone would be, like,

201
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,590
"你的化装服呢
"Where's your costume?

202
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,350
为什么你穿工作服来啊  傻子"
Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"

203
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,470
伙计们  好呀
Hello, boys.

204
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,770
你在笑什么
What are you smiling at?

205
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,780
没什么
Nothing.

206
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,620
你们知道哪里什么都没有吗
You know where's there's a lot of nothing.

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,410
太空嘛
Space.

208
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,860
天啊  睡在床上不浮起来的感觉真好
Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again.

209
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,020
我有告诉过你  某晚我的牙保持器
Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out

210
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,910
飘出我的嘴巴  飘进密封舱里吗
of my mouth and into the air lock?

211
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,700
有  你提过一两次吧
Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

212
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,070
我们终于团聚
So, here we are,

213
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,100
好一对新婚小夫妻
just a couple of young newlyweds.

214
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,490
做点什么好呢
What to do?

215
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,380
对  你  做  点  什  么  好
What to do to you?

216
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
宇航员沃罗威茨  上床报到
Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty.

217
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,920
"推进器"准备
Preparing thrusters.

218
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,000
"火箭"成功升空
We have liftoff.

219
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,510
睡袍是否能"脱离"了
Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?

220
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,170
够了  我们得谈谈了
Okay, we need to talk.

221
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,830
谈什么
What?

222
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,450
华仔  我知道你登上了太空
Howie, I know you went to space.

223
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,400
我由衷地为你骄傲
I'm incredibly proud of you.

224
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
可你最好不要
But you might want to try

225
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,460
老把这件事挂在嘴边
and not bring it up every minute.

226
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,010
我没有总是提这事啊
I don't talk about it every minute.

227
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,430
今晚吃饭时你就聊了整整一个小时
Tonight at dinner you went on about it for an hour straight.

228
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,250
那不然聊什么
What was I supposed to talk about?

229
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,100
那餐馆叫约翰"火箭"啊
We were eating at Johnny Rockets.

230
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,890
我是说  大家都有点厌倦这话题了
I'm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.

231
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,970
所以我完成了如此壮举
So, I did this amazing thing

232
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,680
还不准我念叨两句了吗
and I'm never allowed to mention it?

233
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
你当然可以提
Of course you can.

234
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,340
但更好的方式是
But maybe a good rule would be

235
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,580
等别人先提起这件事
to wait for people to bring it up.

236
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,570
好  没问题
Okay, no problem.

237
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,740
我不会再主动聊了
It won't happen again.

238
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,270
我爱你
I love you.

239
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,610
我也爱你
I love you, too.

240
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,140
你都不知道我做过多少次
I can't tell you how many times I dreamed

241
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,910
和你同床的梦  当我在...
I was in bed here with you when I was...

242
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,390
你懂的
you know.

243
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,280
怎么  连指一下也不行吗
What, I can't even point?

244
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,140
总的来说  这就是所谓的磁悬浮技术
So, basically, this is what's called maglev technology.

245
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,520
运用超强的电磁体
It uses very powerful electromagnets

246
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,320
制造出能对抗重力的磁悬浮力
to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity.

247
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
拿着这个
Here, you hold this.

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
-好重啊  -没错
- Whoa! That's heavy. - Yeah.

249
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
你没带什么珠宝首饰吧
Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?

250
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,230
没带  怎么了
No. Why?

251
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,500
上次有个研究生忘了摘"环"
A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings.

252
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,550
如今他在排队等着
Now he's on a transplant list

253
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,650
移植和他匹配的乳头呢
waiting for a nipple his size.

254
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,370
看好了
Now watch this.

255
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,260
真是太酷了
That is very cool.

256
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,930
有时候我会开启仪器
Sometimes I like to turn this on

257
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,930
然后假装我是无敌坏蛋万磁王
and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.

258
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,070
你这么说就不酷了  莱纳德
It's getting a little less cool, Leonard.

259
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,320
其实我只是一个特别聪明的科学家
But what I really am is a very smart scientist

260
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,150
身怀宇宙力学知识
who understands the mechanics of the universe

261
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,140
身穿你买的性感黑色小裤裤
and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.

262
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,260
这就对了
There we go.

263
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,270
我觉得这次派对的拍照间
So, I thought the photo booth for the party

264
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,510
可以布置成恐怖的木乃伊之墓
could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb,

265
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,570
或者是《神秘博士》里的塔迪斯一样也不错
or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.

266
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,540
塔迪斯可不行
A Tardis makes no sense.

267
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,410
它是科幻小说里的时间机器
It's a time machine from a science-fiction show.

268
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,980
和万圣节扯不上关系
It has nothing to do with Halloween.

269
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,220
尽管如此  如果你不搞个塔迪斯来
That being said, if you don't get a Tardis,

270
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,240
你和你的派对就弱爆了
you stink and your party stinks.

271
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,470
你喜欢哪一种
Do you have a preference?

272
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,820
无所谓  就塔迪斯吧
I don't care. Get the Tardis.

273
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,810
太好了  这次派对一定超好玩
Yes! This party just became a major rager.

274
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,100
对了  我能借一下你的皮鞭和软呢帽吗
Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?

275
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,060
行啊  随便你
Yeah, sure, whatever.

276
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,430
我想打扮成
I was thinking of dressing up as

277
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,910
印第安纳·琼斯的棕皮肤私生子
Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child.

278
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,920
印度·琼斯
"Indian" Jones.

279
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,750
很有哏
Clever.

280
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,680
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
没怎么呀
Nothing.

282
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,130
霍华德  我还得策划派对呢
Oh, Howard, I've got a party to plan.

283
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,220
别让我费劲逼问你了
Don't make me pull it out of you.

284
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,080
好吧  说就说
Okay, here it is.

285
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,700
伯纳黛特说你们都特别烦我
Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me

286
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,620
老提上太空的事
talking about my trip to space.

287
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
这是真的吗
Is that true?

288
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,550
-不是  -是
- No. - Yes.

289
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,050
我俩的处理方式貌似相左啊
We seem to have different approaches here.

290
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,630
我是准备诚实地帮助他
I was going for helpful honesty.

291
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,740
你这是什么招数呢
I have no idea what you're doing.

292
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,890
我这叫当好人
It's called being nice.

293
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,500
好吧  如果你当好人
Okay. If you think being nice

294
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,460
就可以让他闭嘴  那我也当好人吧
will get him to shut up, I'll try it.

295
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,540
好了各位  没关系的
You know what, guys? Never mind.

296
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,050
我再也不提我这辈子最伟大的成就
I just won't talk about the greatest achievement

297
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,120
就是了
of my life ever again.

298
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,730
你瞧  不攻自破了
Look at that, the problem solved itself.

299
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,160
小崽子们好啊
Hello, boys.

300
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,840
我们装扮成
What if we were to go

301
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,640
餐桌最佳拍档"盐和胡椒"如何
as dinner table favorites salt and pepper?

302
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,230
你明知道我吃多了盐就水肿
You know salt makes me retain water

303
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,400
而我威廉表哥在胡椒工厂事故中被磨死了
and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident.

304
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,210
我们扮"破烂小安和破烂安迪"吧
How about Raggedy Ann and Andy?

305
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,350
我小时候特别喜欢他们
I loved them growing up.

306
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,650
我不敢苟同
No, I don't think so.

307
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,150
那些破娃娃代表了我最不爱的三件事
Those dolls represent three things I do not care for:

308
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,620
小丑  小孩和破烂
clowns, children and raggediness.

309
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,490
-我觉得没戏了  -不行
- I think it's a lost cause. - No.

310
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,910
在这世上  有几件事能向大家证明
There are certain things that say to the world,

311
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,150
"我的男朋友是真实存在的"
"I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up."

312
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,960
情侣装
Matching costumes,

313
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,090
吻痕  以及性爱录影带
hickeys and sex tapes.

314
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,180
你选一个吧
Pick one.

315
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,910
什么是吻痕
What's a hickey?

316
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,190
我美不
How do I look?

317
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,270
还行
Fine.

318
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,340
哎呀  有人不开心吗[蓝色]
Uh-oh, is someone a little blue?

319
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,060
拜托  华仔  这可是我这辈子说过
Come on, Howie, that's like the funniest thing

320
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,240
最搞笑的话了
I've ever said in my life.

321
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,370
怎么样  可以走了吗
What do you say? You ready to go?

322
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,890
说实话  我没啥心情去
To tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood.

323
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,450
说什么呢  会很好玩的
What are you talking about? It'll be fun.

324
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,900
你所有的朋友都会去
All your friends'll be there.

325
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,630
是  所谓的朋友  他们都觉得我很无趣
Yeah, some friends. They all think I'm boring.

326
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,670
也许你应该一个人去
Maybe you should go without me.

327
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,810
不  如果我一个人去  人家会以为
No, if I'm there alone, people might think

328
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,700
我是《阿凡达》里的小矮子
I'm just a really short person from Avatar.

329
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,290
抱歉  我就是不想去
I'm sorry. I just don't want to go.

330
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,070
我刚花了三小时把自己涂成蓝色
Hey, I just spent the last three hours coloring myself blue.

331
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,190
我"蓝密处"的蓝色得洗一个月才会掉呢
I'm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month!

332
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,620

Fine.

333
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,960
两周前我还是宇航员
Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.

334
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,620
好啦  你现在是蓝精灵  快走
Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf. Keep walking.

335
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,420
我的天  你们好可爱

337

338
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,620
不  性感女警

339
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,850
放荡女警的行头只有超短裙和两个徽章遮胸
Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.

340
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,490

342
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,480
因为我超速超过光年了
for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.

343

我们在车里说过了  不准有口音
I thought we said in the car, no accents?

344
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,240
抱歉  警官

I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.

356

这是妥协  我输了
It was a compromise. I lost.

357
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,640
斯图尔特居然到处招摇  将派对
Can you believe Stuart's walking around

358
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,260
成功的功劳全揽在他一人身上
taking credit for this party?

359
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,570
谁在乎啊
Who cares?

360
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,740
你这么说是什么意思
What do you mean "Who cares"?

361
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,920
看看我的心血
Look at what I pulled off here.

Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.

366
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,990

求你  再多说说
Please, tell me more.

368
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,920
我这周还没听够呢
I haven't heard enough about it all week

369
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,460
听这个话题永远不会腻
because hearing about that never gets old!

370
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,110
这又是因为太空那件事吗
Is this about the space thing again?

371
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,750
我不允许谈这个话题
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it,

372
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,980
但既然你提了  我上过太空
but since you brought it up, I went to space!

373
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,930
太空  太空  太空  我上过太空
Space, space, space! Space, space, space!

374
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,910
醉鬼蓝精灵
Whoa, Drinky Smurf.

375
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,150
过来我们说两句
Can I talk to you for a second?

376
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,870
好了  我有麻烦了
Great, now I'm in trouble.

377
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,780
你开心了吧
You happy?!

378
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,470
你  给我出去
You, out!

379
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,870
你太没礼貌了
You are being very rude!

380
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,110
我才不是  他们才没礼貌
No, I'm not. They're all being rude.

381
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,290
你也没礼貌
And you're being rude.

382
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,920
我  我做了什么
Me? What did I do?

383
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,680
"华仔
"Oh, Howie...

384
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,520
别再说这么多太空的事了
Stop talking about space so much.

385
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,930
没人喜欢听"
Nobody likes it."

386
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,470
我说话才不是那样
I don't sound like that.

387
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,950
你是我老婆
You're my wife.

388
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,520
你应该支持我才对
You're supposed to be on my side.

389
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,450
我一直是支持你的啊
I'm always on your side.

390
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,630
那你为什么不让我炫耀这事
Then why are you trying to take this away from me?

391
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,330
成为一名宇航员
Being an astronaut is

392
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,050
是我这辈子能做的最酷的事
the coolest thing I'm ever gonna do.

393
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,720
如果我不再说这个  那我只是...
If I stop talking about it, then I'm just...

394
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,390
只是什么
Just what?

395
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,420
只是以前无趣的霍华德·沃罗威茨了
Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.

396
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,610
以前无趣的他  是我认识的最好的男人
Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.

397
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,040
你只是说了安慰我
You're just saying that.

398
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,390
我不是  我嫁给了他
No, I'm not. I married him.

399
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,230
特意的哦

400
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,800

I love you.

402
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,580
我也爱你
I love you, too.

403
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,410
没什么热闹可瞧
Nothing to see here.

404
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,570
性感女警在执行公务
Just sexy police business.

405
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,360
我只是跟她解释相对论
Just explaining the theory of relativity.

406
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,600
"两次"哦
Twice.

407
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,360
在看什么呢
Hey, what you watching?

408
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,230
不知道
I don't know.
