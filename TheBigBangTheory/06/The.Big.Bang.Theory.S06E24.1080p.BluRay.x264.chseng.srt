1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,120
昨天晚上我跟露西视频
So, anyway, last night on video chat,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,500
我盯着她的双眸足足有二十分钟
I spent, like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,730
听起来很浪漫啊
Oh, that sounds romantic.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,410
后来发现是画面卡了  就毫无浪漫可言了
It was until I realized the screen had frozen.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,840
但这还是我这辈子最棒约会的前三名
Still one of my top three dates of all time.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,690
她什么时候会来跟大伙聚聚啊
So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,560
我也想啊
I'd love that,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,920
但她实在不太善于与人交流
but she's not really comfortable around people.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,760
我以前也跟她一样不善与人交流
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people,

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,400
后来学到一个小诀窍
but then I learned a trick.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
我把认识的每个人
I pretend everyone I meet

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,420
都看作是《星际迷航》里受欢迎的角色
is a beloved character from Star Trek.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,050
那这招管用吗
How's that been working for you?

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,550
当然好用啊  你个无名红衣机组人员
Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,810
莱纳德  我可能帮你弄到了份工作
Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,610
-我有工作了  -他真的有哦
- I have a job. - Yes, he does.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,750
工作就是服务我的一切要求
He caters to my every whim.

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,120
不  再过几周  史蒂芬·霍金要
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,680
送一对远征实验队伍去北海
is sending an expedition to the North Sea

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,270
做黑洞的流体动力学模拟
to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,750
队伍中有一名实验物理学家退出了
One of their experimental physicists dropped out,

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,890
所以我就推荐了你
and I recommended you.

23
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,110
你觉得我真有机会雀屏中选吗
Well, do you really think I have a shot?

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,430
我跟霍金共事过  说了你不少好话呢
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking. I talked you up.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,870
他知道你的研究
He knows your research.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,280
我觉得希望非常大
I think this could happen.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,400
他居然知道...  哇
He knows-- Wow!

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,820
你觉得这真是个好主意吗
Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea?

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,670
我觉得行  你也知道《星际迷航》
I do. Uh, you know Star Trek.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,350
一个没有角色名字
Should a guy with no name

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,280
穿着普通制服的人适合去参加实验吗
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,540
别这样打击他
Hey, don't discourage him.

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,230
这是他千载难逢的好机会呢
This is a fantastic opportunity.

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,250
没人问你  女通讯官乌乎拉
No one asked you, Uhura.

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,320
想听听谢尔顿招牌亦假亦真小讲堂吗
Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,670
-你说呢  -很好
- What do you think? - Great.

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,330
我最近读了不少交通工具安全
I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety.

38
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,980
你知道溺水的最高几率的
Did you know that the highest number

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,800
发生地点是在船上或是船附近吗
of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,820
在我很有可能去船上工作前
Interesting that you would bring that up

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,670
你提起这事  时机很巧妙啊
when I might go work on a boat.

42
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,290
亦假亦真就是这样的
Well, that's the thing about factoids--

43
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,100
听起来就很巧妙
they're interesting.

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,130
我知道你的小算盘
I know what you're doing.

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,700
你不想我去这个实验之旅
You don't want me going on this research trip

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,770
因为你害怕自己独处
because you're afraid to be alone.

47
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,970
我才不害怕自己独处
I'm not afraid to be alone.

48
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,560
在陆地就不怕
On land.

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
在海上呢  这就可怕了
On the sea, it would be terrifying.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,900
太容易溺死了
Because of all the drowning.

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,080
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
行  我不提溺水了
Fine, no more drowning talk.

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,450
我换个话题
I'll change the subject.

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,160
你觉得这两者打架  谁能赢呢
Who do you think would win in a fight--

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,560
你或鲨鱼
you or a shark?

56
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,840
我感谢你这招牌的
Look, I appreciate your signature blend

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,260
"为我着想"与"超级自私"
of concern for me and incredible selfishness.

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,880
如果我能有机会入选
If I get the chance to do this,

59
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,890
你说什么都没办法阻止我去的
there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,950
非常好
Very well.

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,410
你与佩妮的感情现在好到不行
Things between you and Penny have never been better.

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,750
我只希望四个月的分离不会改变这一切
I hope four months apart doesn't change anything.

63
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,670
我应该先提这件事的对吧
I should have opened with that, huh?

64
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,290
生活大爆炸 第六季  第二十四集[本季终]

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,100
如果你仔细看向金星
If you look carefully at Venus,

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,160
你应该能看见
you should be able to see

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,300
国际太空站从它面前经过
the International Space Station pass by.

68
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,550
你朋友真去过那上面吗
Your friend was actually up there?

69
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,060
他还带了一件T恤给我  上面写着
Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said,

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,350
"我朋友上了国际太空站
"My Friend Went to the Space Station

71
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,210
而我只有拿到这件傻逼T恤"
and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt""

72
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,330
-他有带那件T恤上太空吗  -没有
- Did he take the T-shirt to space? - Nope.

73
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,920
但那衣服绝对够傻逼
It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

74
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,260
说到朋友
Speaking of friends,

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,180
我的朋友们想见见你呢
they have been asking to meet you.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,690
我想着或许
I was thinking

77
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,580
有机会我们大家一起聚一聚吧
maybe we could all hang out sometime?

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,870
我不知道
I don't know.

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,240
你有多少朋友啊
How many are there?

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,450
我算算  六个
Let's see. Six.

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,240
哇  好酷  我有六个朋友呢
That's pretty cool; I have six friends!

82
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,770
有点像西纳特拉
Kind of like Sinatra.
西纳特拉  美国上世纪杰出男歌手
有过一档与7名好友歌唱的节目  名为"西纳特拉与好友们'

83
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,140
六个陌生人
Six strangers?

84
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,740
这压力好大啊
That's a lot of pressure.

85
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,560
盯着我看  问我一堆私人问题
Staring at me, asking me personal questions.

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
比如"你做什么工作的"
Like, "What do you do?"

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,940
"你从哪里来的"
"Where are you from?"

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,860
"你为什么要把自己锁在厕所里呢"
"Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?"

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,480
要不你就先见其中一个
Okay, how about you just dip your toe in

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,960
看看情况如何
and meet one of them?

91
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,410
你会来吗
Will you be there?

92
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,530
当然啊
Of course.

93
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,720
那就是两个陌生人  算我自己就三个
Well, that's two. Three if you count me.

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,490
这事情越来越失控了
Oh, this is getting out of hand.

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,710
在我下午上班的时候
So, then, during my afternoon shift,

96
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,620
我不小心把整托盘的饮料全撒身上了
I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,740
好惨啊
Oh, that's awful.

98
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,490
也没有啦  靠着湿透的衣服
Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

99
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,190
我拿到了我这辈子最多的小费呢
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life. Oh.

100
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,880
你还记得我跟你说过有关
So, listen, do you remember when I said

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,420
广义相对论与流体力学
the similarities of the equations

102
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,020
方程中的相似处表示了
of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,810
在有巨量水源的地方很可能能找到
you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation

104
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,580
盎鲁射线的相似物
in a large body of water?

105
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,810
这不是我跟你说的吗
I thought I said that to you.

106
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,360
总而言之
Anyway,

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,680
史提芬·霍金的队伍在研究这个
Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that,

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,130
而他们要请我加入
and I've been invited to join them.

109
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,580
霍金呢  恭喜你
Wow, Hawking! Good for you!

110
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,570
是很好
Well, it is.

111
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,050
但是  这样我就得离开一阵子
Just-- you know, I'd be gone for a while.

112
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,170
多久呢
Well, how long?

113
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,390
三四个月吧
Three, four months.

114
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,050
-什么时候走  -再过几周吧
- When would you leave? - Couple weeks.

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,530
没事  那我去看你好啦
O-Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.

116
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,610
这就是问题所在  你不能来
That's the thing-- you can't.

117
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,550
因为我会在北海的一艘船上
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

118
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,350
在船上
On a ship?

119
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,190
不怕坐在轮椅上的霍金  会从甲板上滚下去吗
Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?

120
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,840
他不会去
Uh, he's not gonna be there.

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,920
他只是派人去研究他的理论
He's just sending a team to research his theory.

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,850
当然
Oh, sure.

123
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,150
就像你派我去打死你浴缸的蜘蛛一样
Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub.

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,370
好吧  整整四个月
Okay. Four months.

125
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,840
是的
Yeah.

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,390
我有点担心
And I'm a little worried

127
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,010
因为咱们俩现在感情这么好
because things between us have been so great,

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,760
我不想做任何会破坏感情的事情
and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up.

129
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
亲爱的  一般会破坏感情
Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up,

130
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,190
都是你在的时候  你不在时万事大吉
it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,260
没关系  你必须得去
No. I mean, look, you have to go.

132
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,070
听起来这是个很棒的机会
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

133
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,560
我之所以这么说  是因为
And I'm just basing that on how much

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,870
我一点也不懂你刚说的话
I didn't understand what you said about it.

135
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,790
好吧
Okay.

136
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,240
我明天早上会确认行程安排
I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
好  很好
Okay. Good.

138
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,170
-我需要你帮我做件事  -说吧
- I do have to ask you one favor. - Sure.

139
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,810
谢尔顿对我的离开很不安
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving.

140
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,600
我不在的时候  记得帮我照顾下他
Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.

141
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,310
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

142
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,980
还记得以前我是怎么照顾你的金鱼的吗
Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?

143
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,330
那就把谢尔顿冲下马桶  再给我买个新的
Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.

144
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,370
真的  你们真没必要帮我弄个告别派对
Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.

145
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,200
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,930
人生能有几次跟真正去大海航行的人
How often can you say "bon voyage" to somebody

147
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,210
说"一路[航行]平安"
when they're actually going on a voyage?

148
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,370
你好  拉杰
Hello, Rajesh.

149
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
你好  艾米  很高兴见到你
Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

150
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,710
那又怎么样  带口音比较好玩嘛
What can I say? It's funnier with the accent.

151
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,190
冰箱里有啤酒
There's beer in the fridge.

152
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,500
总之你们真的不必小题大作
Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.

153
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,140
莱纳德  你太自私了
Leonard, you're being selfish.

154
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,500
我们必须得举行一个告别仪式  等你死在海里
We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure

155
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
脸被螃蟹吃掉的时候  我们也有个解脱
when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.

156
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,900
谢尔顿  麻烦把嘴闭上
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

157
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,400
霍华德当年上太空那么久
You know, one of the things

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
支撑我熬过这段时间的其中一件事
that helped me get through Howard being in space

159
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,580
就在他走之前跟他结婚
for so long was getting married before he left.

160
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,340
伯纳黛特  麻烦把嘴闭上
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,890
好了
Okay.

162
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,950
我有一件事想麻烦大家
I have a request to make.

163
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,350
现在他居然可以说话了
And now he can talk.

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,840
我真想切开你的脑子
I want to cut open your brain

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,170
看看里面到底是怎么回事
and see what the heck's going on in there.

166
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,180
唯一能检查[进入]我脑子的人是菲尔博士
The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil.
菲尔博士是有博士学位的心理医生
专门在电视上帮别人解决家庭问题

167
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,120
总之
Anyway, I-

168
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,380
我跟我的新女友说要带她来见你们
I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all,

169
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,920
她觉得先见你们其中一个
and she thought it would be easier for her

170
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,410
会比较不让她害怕
to start with just one.

171
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,890
我可不知道有没有时间
Oh, gee, I don't know.

172
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,150
我的日程有点满
My schedule's a little busy.

173
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,820
其实我是想让她先见莱纳德
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

174
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,770
谢谢  拉杰  我非常荣幸
Thank you, Raj. I'd be honored.

175
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,440
我擦咧
What the hell?

176
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,730
我以为我才是你最好的朋友
I thought I was your best friend.

177
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,070
你是啊  但你的个人特色过于鲜明
You are, but you've got kind of a big personality,

178
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,230
你看你花哨的衣服和那吊儿郎当范儿
with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.

179
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,740
或许先跟女生见面  她会更放松
You know, maybe she'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.

180
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,210
好主意  伯纳黛特
Good idea. Bernadette?

181
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,030
我擦咧
What the hell?!

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
你长得非常漂亮
Well, you're very pretty.

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,030
这会让其他女性有威胁感
That could be intimidating to another woman.

184
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,710
也对
Oh, yeah.

185
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,580
你觉得我不够漂亮  不会吓着你的女朋友吗
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,110
冷静  妮妮
Calm down, Bernie.

187
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,190
你非常吓人
You're very scary.

188
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,710
-应该让我去  -为什么
- It should be me. - Why?

189
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,810
好让你开把我脑子切开的玩笑吗
So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?

190
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,430
首先  那可不是开玩笑
A, that was not a joke.

191
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,420
那是个真诚的请求
That was a sincere request.

192
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,060
其次  更重要的是
And B, more importantly,

193
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,850
我曾经是这个小团体中的局外人
I was the outsider to this group,

194
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,190
我知道初次见面的感觉有多可怕
and I know how frightening that can be.

195
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,610
但你们接纳我  让我感受到你们的爱
But you guys took me in and made me feel loved,

196
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,770
就像家人的爱一样
like I was family.

197
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,560
好啦  我去就是了
Fine, I'll do it.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,110
在我开始跟谢尔顿约会之后
So, after I started dating Sheldon,

199
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,760
我认识了莱纳德  还有其他人
I met Leonard, and then everybody else,

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,950
他们都对我非常好
and they've all been so wonderful to me.

201
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,510
听起来真不错
That's really nice to hear.

202
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,930
或许下周  我们可以一起聚聚
Maybe next week, we could all get together.

203
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,990
露西  你可以不用回答
Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that.

204
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,300
别把她逼到这个份上  她不喜欢这样
Don't put her on the spot. She hates that.

205
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,890
我说得对吗
Am I right?

206
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,000
告诉她你有多不喜欢被人逼着去交际
Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,230
快啊  告诉她
Go ahead, tell her.

208
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,280
别搭理他
Ignore him.

209
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
他有点紧张  因为他觉得我不明白
He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand

210
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,990
你社交焦虑症的严重程度
the severity of your social anxiety.

211
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,080
搞毛呀  你疯了吗
What the...? Are you crazy?

212
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,150
你不能跟有社交焦虑症的人
You can't talk about social anxiety

213
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,700
谈论社交焦虑症
to someone who has social anxiety.

214
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,900
这会让他们更加焦虑的
It makes them socially anxious!

215
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,700
不好意思  但我是个神经生物学家
Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist.

216
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,230
我觉得我比你更懂得
I think I'm a little more qualified than you

217
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,990
你女朋友的脑子里的毛病在哪里
to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!

218
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,660
别说她是我的女朋友
Don't call her my girlfriend.

219
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,650
我们还没正式说过
We haven't discussed whether or not

220
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,690
我们到底是不是男女朋友呢
we're girlfriend or boyfriend yet.

221
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,640
既然这话题已经提出来了
Now that it's out there...

222
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,110
你是我的女朋友吗
...are you my girlfriend?

223
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,110
顺便说一下  如果你说"不是"
By the way, if you say no,

224
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,490
那我会伤心郁闷一辈子哦
I'll never be happy again.

225
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,580
我可不是逼你哦
Not to put you on the spot.

226
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
我想去个厕所
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

227
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,820
我们可以先开始吃了
We might as well go ahead and eat.

228
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,950
她短时间内不会回来了
She's not coming back anytime soon.

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,760
真是可笑
This is ridiculous.

230
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,940
我们为派对购物
We're shopping for a party.

231
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,040
可这商店都没有"派对专区"
This store doesn't even have a party section.

232
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,440
有的有的  就在这儿
Yeah, it does, and here we are.

233
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,110
佩妮  我不得不说
You know, I have to say, Penny,

234
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,180
我真不明白你怎么会
I don't understand why you of all people

235
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,350
鼓励莱纳德去那个项目
are encouraging Leonard to do this.

236
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,160
我是他的女朋友  当然要支持他啦
Well, I'm his girlfriend; of course I'm gonna support him.

237
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,730
你只是他现在的女朋友而已嘛
Yeah, well, you're his girlfriend for now.

238
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,160
你可能还不了解形势
You know, maybe you're not aware of this,

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,860
但根据悠久的传统
but there is a rich tradition

240
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,740
出海人很能在他人的双臂双腿间找寻安慰
of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.

241
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,180
亲爱的  这对莱纳德很重要
Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?

242
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,740
他将会与史蒂芬·霍金共事
He gets to work with Stephen Hawking.

243
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,670
另外  霍金不会上船
Who, by the way, will not be on the boat.

244
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,840
我查清了
I checked it out.

245
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,800
这机会也不算千载难逢
It's not that big of an opportunity.

246
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,730
就算霍金的理论是正确的
And even if Hawking's theories are correct,

247
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,360
那他证明也无非是宇宙是从哪来的
all they prove is where the universe came from,

248
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,860
万物存在的原因及宇宙的尽头
why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.

249
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,410
而我
I mean, me?

250
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,840
我感兴趣的是更宏观的问题
I'm interested in the big questions.

251
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,380
上帝啊  天才谢尔顿竟然嫉妒莱纳德
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.

252
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,100
我才没嫉妒
I'm not jealous.

253
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,770
我只是不开心
I'm just very unhappy

254
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,970
好事情发生在他身上
that good things are happening for him

255
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,080
却没我的份
and not happening for me.

256
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,940
亲爱的  有这种感觉很正常
Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay?

257
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,990
但莱纳德身上有好事发生
But just because good things are happening to Leonard

258
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,860
不代表你会损失什么啊
doesn't take anything away from you.

259
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,410
我给你讲个故事吧
You know what? Let me tell you a little story.

260
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,650
从前有个在起司工厂工作的女孩
Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory,

261
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,180
她对自己的工作不怎么擅长
and she wasn't very good at her job.

262
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,340
-是你  -不是我
- It was you. - It wasn't me.

263
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,240
但她同样也是个演员
But she was also an actress,

264
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
我们都是某支牙膏广告的
and we were both up for the same part

265
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,820
候选人
in a toothpaste commercial.

266
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,780
她拿到了  我特别嫉妒
She got it. Look, I was so jealous.

267
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,560
但我没有扯掉她那一头假冒的金发
But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair...

268
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
你扯掉了自己那一头假冒的金发
You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.

269
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,100
我
I...

270
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,260
看着她的眼睛
looked her in the eye,

271
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,550
笑着说  "我真为你高兴"
smiled and said, "I'm happy for you."

272
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,620
因为朋友就该这样
Because that's what friends do.

273
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,470
-为了不显得小气而说谎  -对
- They lie so they don't look petty. - Yeah.

274
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,800
-要怎么做  -像这样
- How? - Like this.

275
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,700
我太为你开心了
I am so happy for you.

276
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,090
怪不得牙膏广告没选上你
No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial.

277
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,700
我想为艾米昨晚的表现道歉
I want to apologize for Amy last night.

278
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,250
她太过分了
She was completely out of line.

279
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,690
是你没说话
Are you... are you not speaking to me

280
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,780
还是画面又卡住了
or did the screen freeze again?

281
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,010
根本不关艾米的事
Amy wasn't the problem.

282
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,670
好吧  我知道
Okay. I know.

283
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,340
是我不好
It was me.

284
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,930
我把你逼得太紧了  对不起
I-I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

285
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,410
谢谢理解
Thank you.

286
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,580
我在想
You know, I-I've been thinking that...

287
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,310
也许一对一地见他们太让人紧张了
maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense,

288
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,560
所以
so...

289
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,480
我的朋友们周五会举办个派对
Friday night, my friends are having a party.

290
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,470
-派对  -小型的
- A party? - A little one!

291
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,730
是为了给莱纳德饯行
It's-it's a farewell for Leonard,

292
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,250
所以大家只会关注他
so all the attention will be on him.

293
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,550
如果你穿棕色的衣服  往沙发上一坐
If you wear something brown and sit on the couch,

294
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,460
他们压根就不会发现你的存在
they won't even know you're there.

295
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,530
我不确定
I'm not sure.

296
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,320
-拜托了  -拉杰
- Oh, please? - Raj.

297
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,950
拜托啦  真要让我求你啊
Come on. Don't make me beg.

298
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,570
我来自印度  我可懂怎么求人了
And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.

299
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,220
好吧
Okay.

300
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,340
谢谢
Y... Thank you!

301
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,860
这对我意义重大
Th-This means a lot to me.

302
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,680
我的朋友就像家人一样
My friends are like my family.

303
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,780
除非你不喜欢他们
Unless you don't like them;

304
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,940
那样的话  他们对我毫无意义
in which case, they're dead to me.

305
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,370
你以前在船上长时间待过吗
So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?

306
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,910
-待过  -你说的是那次
- Yeah. - Are you referring to the time

307
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,280
我们在迪士尼玩小小世界的时候船卡住不动吗
we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

308
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,450
是的
Yeah.

309
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,630
你真让我自豪  莱纳德
I'm proud of you, Leonard.

310
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,340
在北海工作几个月
Working out on the North Sea for months--

311
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,750
-这可真了不起  -我知道
- that's really something. - I know.

312
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,180
不管科学研究得如何
As far as science goes,

313
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,620
这可是百年不遇的经历啊
this is the adventure of a lifetime.

314
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,010
对你可能是的
Maybe your lifetime.

315
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,870
反正我是去过太空了
I went to space.

316
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,590
这可没什么可比的
It's not a competition.

317
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,080
你说得对
You're right, you're right.

318
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,490
我真为你感到骄傲
I'm really proud of you, and...

319
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,780
你去了以后我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

320
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,520
另外太空可比大海牛
And space beats water.

321
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,090
拉杰什  我以为露西会来呢
Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.

322
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,720
她要来的  只不过稍微迟到了点
She is. She's just running a little late.

323
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,890
你知道的  女孩子出门总要花时间
You know how it is-- girls always fussing about

324
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,460
弄头发啊  化妆啊啥的
their hair, their makeup.

325
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,670
她会来的
She'll be here.

326
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,530
别老问了  好吗
Just give it a rest, okay?

327
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,790
大家请注意
Um, can I have your attention, everyone?

328
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,570
给没有绝对音感的人  这是降B调
That's, uh, B-flat, for those who don't have perfect pitch.

329
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
我想给我最好的朋友
I would like to propose a toast

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,420
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德敬一杯酒
to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

331
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,140
他现在得到了一个弥足珍贵的机会
He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity,

332
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,360
我非常为他高兴
and I couldn't be happier for him.

333
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,280
谢谢  谢尔顿
Thank you, Sheldon.

334
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,400
你能说出这话真不容易
That must've been very hard for you to say.

335
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
我是真心的
Well, I mean it.

336
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,000
我真的很为你高兴
I'm really happy for you.

337
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,770
你得这样才能拿下那牙膏广告  干杯
And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

338
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,340
干杯
Cheers.

339
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,580
你能为莱纳德高兴  真是不错
It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.

340
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,640
谢谢
Thank you.

341
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,190
我上太空时  你肯定是眼红到不行吧
It must've killed you when I went to space.

342
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,040
不好
Oh, no.

343
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,260
兄弟  没事吧
Buddy, you okay?

344
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,240
老天
Oh, man.

345
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,910
出什么事了
What's going on?

346
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,730
念出来吧
Uh, go ahead. Read it.

347
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,930
"拉杰  我不能来参加派对
"Raj, I can't come to the party.

348
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,940
这对我来说  难以承受
This is all just too much for me.

349
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,880
我觉得我们还是不要再见面了
I don't think we should see each other anymore.

350
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,170
对不起  露西"
Sorry. Lucy."

351
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,940
失陪下
Excuse me.

352
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,090
拉杰  太遗憾了
Raj, I'm so sorry.

353
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,590
别太难过
Me, too.

354
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,190
你上太空时  我才没有眼红呢
It did not kill me when you went to space.

355
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,350
猴子都上过太空
Monkeys went to space.

356
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,470
到机场了
Well, here we are.

357
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,270
是的
Yep.

358
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,020
我会非常想你的
I'm really gonna miss you.

359
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,970
我也会想你的
I'm gonna miss you, too.

360
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,410
佩妮  我们在红线区
Penny, we're in the red zone.

361
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,020
白线区才是上下车区
The white zone is for loading and unloading.

362
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,280
我们现在犯法了
We're breaking the law.

363
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,110
-白线区没地方了  -总之
- Okay, there's no space in the white zone, so... - Anyway,

364
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,880
我们可以发电邮  那里的手机信号
we can E-mail, and I-I think the phone connections

365
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,790
应该也不错
are pretty good.

366
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,950
好了  你赶紧下车吧
All right, you have to get out of the car right now.

367
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,870
我不会为了你去坐牢的
I'm not going to jail for you.

368
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,250
你放轻松行吗
Would you just relax?

369
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,780
白线区空出来一个位置
Oh, I see a space in the white zone.

370
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,990
快  绕机场一圈冲上去
Quick, circle the airport.

371
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,600
呼吸器带的够吗
Did you bring enough inhalers?

372
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,340
够
Yeah.

373
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,860
额外的晕船药呢
And, uh, extra Dramamine?

374
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,450
你还记得那次小小世界的事故吧
You remember what happened on It's a Small World.

375
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,870
-带了  -好的
- I'm covered. - Okay.

376
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,260
老天爷  一个警察冲我们
Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's

377
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,510
这个方向扫了一眼
glancing in our direction.

378
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,670
我们死定了
We've been made.

379
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,630
冷静下  我下车了
Calm down. I'm getting out.

380
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,010
我要送你件礼物
I have something I want to give you.

381
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,920
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard.

382
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,040
只是一个心形的相盒吊坠项链
It's just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of

383
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,780
里面有莱纳德的照片  他在商场清仓时买的
Leonard's face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance.

384
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,500
快下车吧
Now move, move, move!

385
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,840
我爱你
I love you.

386
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,070
我也爱你
I love you, too.

387
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,970
别担心  警官
Don't worry, Officer.

388
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,510
他们只是彼此相爱
They just love each other.

389
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,170
我们没有贩毒
We're not smuggling drugs.

390
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,310
拉杰  我是佩妮
Raj, it's Penny.

391
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,030
你在家吗
Are you in there?

392
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,640
稍等
Hang on.

393
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,900
我刚从机场回来
Hey. I'm just coming back from the airport.

394
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,720
过来看看你怎么样了
I wanted to see how you're doing.

395
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,350
你真好
That's-that's very nice of you.

396
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,510
进来吧
Uh, come, come. Come on in.

397
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,810
我不能待太久
Can't stay long.

398
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,960
我把谢尔顿留在车上了  虽然车窗有开一条缝
I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open.

399
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,820
那本儿童活动书他应该只用
He's gonna go through that activity book

400
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,230
30秒就能看完
in, like, 30 seconds, so...

401
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,140
你还好吗
Are you okay?

402
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,890
不好
No.

403
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,950
我真替你难过
I'm so sorry.

404
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,080
不
No.

405
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,830
这是我的错
It's my fault.

406
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,890
我终于找到了适合我的人
You know, I finally found someone who was right for me,

407
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,520
我却把她吓跑了
and I-I drove her away.

408
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,930
拉杰
Oh, Raj.

409
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,010
佩妮  我...
Penny, I...

410
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,060
我已经开始想她了
I miss her already.

411
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,530
我明白你的感受
I know how you feel.

412
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,780
我也开始想莱纳德了
I miss Leonard, too.

413
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,140
我到底有什么问题啊
What's... what is wrong with me?

414
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,020
为什么我就是不能拥有爱情呢
Why-why can't I ever have love?

415
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,720
你会的
You will.

416
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,070
不  我不会的
No, I... I won't.

417
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,380
没人会爱我
I'm-I'm unlovable.

418
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,830
你是酒喝多了才会这么说
That's just the booze talking.

419
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,650
不是的
No, it's not.

420
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,370
昨晚后我就没喝酒了
I haven't had a drink since last night.

421
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,330
-你在和我说话  -是的
- You're talking to me. - I am.

422
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,640
现在我为了完全不同的原因痛哭流涕了
And now I'm crying for a whole different reason!

423
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,190
我也是
Me, too!

424
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,680
我想我要说的就是
So I-I guess what I'm saying is.

425
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,580
我理解露西的出发点
I get where Lucy's coming from.

426
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,330
很好  要来杯红酒吗
That's great. Do you want some wine?

427
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,780
不用  喝水就行了
Uh, no, water's fine.

428
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,550
总之  我想了很多
Anyhow, I-I've been thinking about it a lot,

429
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,500
我完全理解露西为什么这样做
and-and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.

430
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,420
我给的压力太大了
I pushed too hard.

431
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,440
如果我稍稍放手  给她足够的空间
But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space,

432
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,590
也许我们之间还有未来可言
maybe there's still a future for us.

433
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,450
人生好笑的地方就在于
Yeah, the funny thing about life is that,

434
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,350
有时候...
you know, sometimes...

435
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,840
他还会闭嘴吗
Does he ever shut up?

436
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,550
然后  事情又出现转机
And then, it turns good again,

437
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,830
这比一帆风顺的感觉又会好些
that means it better than if never been bad for a while,

438
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,020
现在  情况就是
and now, things are going...

439
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,830
非常非常的糟糕
in fact, are very very bad.

440
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,960
但至少我的心开始愈合了
But at least my heart is starting to heal.

441
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,620
一步步地慢慢愈合
Slowly but surely.

442
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,870
开始我那叫哭得一个惨啊
And how I cried.

443
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,900
我的脸上就好像来了场暴风雨
It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face.

444
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,270
但我好歹算个男人
But I'm a man, okay?

445
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,450
我需要收拾心情  拿起笔
So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen

446
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,060
把一切心情都写在日记上
and get it all out in my journal.

447
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,370
而且并不全是坏事  对吗
I mean, it's not all bad, right?

448
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,550
我心碎的结果
Having my heart broken

449
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,300
就是令我终于能在你们面前滔滔不绝
has allowed me to finally speak in front of you...

450
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,500
瞧  我终于找到了乌云背后的幸福线
so, you know, it was a silver lining.
