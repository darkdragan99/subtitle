不设下限吗
No rules?

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,720
我们不会喝醉酒后  去跟蓝人乐团
We're not gonna get drunk and have a six-way
蓝人乐团  知名三人打击乐团  成员会把全身涂成蓝色

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,970
大搞床上"六人行"的吧
with the Blue Man Group, are we?

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,690
不会
No.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,590
那就还是有下限啊
So there are some rules.

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,580
行
Fine.

11
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,580
不带男友  不带老公  设了下限
No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,730

女人不在  男人爽快
The ladies are away, the boys will play.

15
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,680
欢乐无极限
Anything can happen.

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,340
大家一起疯
It's gonna get crazy.

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,690
龙与地下城
Dungeons & Dragons!

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,220
我买了一套新比基尼
I got a brand-new bikini,

19
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,330
泳池畔的免费酒水就靠这对胸器了
so drinks at the pool are on these.

20
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,270
我有一件性感上衣写着"来嘛  帅哥"
I got a sexy new tube top that says "Come hither"

21
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,040
以及一瓶名为"滚开  色鬼"的防狼喷雾
and a can of pepper spray that says "Close enough, Jack."

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,540
我准备了一些旧的内衣要丢到
I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage

23
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,800
加斯·布鲁克斯的演唱会舞台上
at the Garth Brooks concert.
美国知名乡村歌手  唱片曾创下乡村音乐最高纪录

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,410
等等  为啥要丢旧的
I'm sorry, why old?

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,360
因为我上次见他的时候  丢了新的
'Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,490
结果也啥都没捞着
and it got me nothing.

27
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,280
我有一组全新内含七个的
I've got a brand-new seven piece set

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,310
多面骰
of polyhedral dice.

29
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,730
新骰子味道真棒
Hello, new dice smell.

30
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,080
我有"天神之力头盔"  "速度之靴"
I've got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed,

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,550
如果玩得太嗨
and if things get too exciting,

32
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,350
我还带了"哮喘者的吸入之器"
my inhaler of asthma.

33
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,650
我有个全新嗜血野蛮战士
I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior

34
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,480
他会蹂躏所有出现在他面前的人
who will lay waste to all who stand before him.

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,130
我还明智地午餐只吃了色拉
And I had a sensible salad for lunch,

36
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,420
所以现在想吃多少披萨都行
so I can eat all the pizza I want.

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,160
拜托  我们是要坐在这
Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting

38
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,800
像少女一样聊天叽叽喳喳呢
like a bunch of teenage girls,

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,240
还是要当永远没机会跟少女发生关系
or are we gonna play D & D like a bunch of teenage boys

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,250
只能玩龙与地下城的寂寞少男啊
who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?!

41
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,880
赌城  赌城  赌城
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,500
莫夫斯克海克地下城

生活大爆炸 第六季  第二十三集

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,870
我很庆幸今晚露西要工作
I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight.

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,760
让我不用尴尬地跟她说
Saved me the awkward conversation about

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,390
我今晚没空  要跟兄弟们玩
how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.

49
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,840
你们俩有任何对话是不尴尬的吗
Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,430
好惨  确实没有
Painfully so.

51
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,370
我们有个小规矩  如果通话时没人说话
We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks

52
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,120
超过三分钟  就可以直接挂掉
for three minutes, you can just hang up.

53
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,010
好中意她啊
So into her.

54
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,350
你们好就能开始了
Ready whenever you guys are.

55
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,120
行  我们马上来
Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there.

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,230
-莱纳德  -怎么了
- Yeah, Leonard... - Yeah?

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,960
我对于霍华德
I'm not sure how I feel

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,010
代替你当地下城主有点不是滋味
about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,160
真有义气
Oh, that's nice.

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,580
但别紧张嘛  偶尔换换也不错
But relax, sometimes change is good.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,380
你以前也担心扎克瑞·昆图
Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto
扎克瑞·昆图  知名演员  曾出演过《英雄》
后出演新一代星际迷航里的斯波克角色

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,480
来演斯波克会不好  可后来你也喜欢他了
being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,610
拜托
Oh, please.

64
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,330
每次提到改变的话题
Every time the topic of change comes up,

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,710
你都用扎克瑞·昆图来堵我的嘴
you throw Zachary Quinto in my face.

66
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,980
我不满邮差换了新发型
I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut:

67
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,560
扎克瑞·昆图
Zachary Quinto.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,330
我不高兴开始夏令时开始
I'm upset that daylight saving time started:

69
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,740
扎克瑞·昆图
Zachary Quinto.

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,440
我不爽夏令时结束  扎克瑞·昆图
I'm upset daylight saving time ended: Zachary Quinto.

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,850
我最后再说一次
I'm saying this for the last time

72
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,370
扎克瑞·昆图是一个奇特
Zachary Quinto was a weird,

73
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,100
美好  又出乎意料的特例
wonderful, unrepeatable event.

74
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,040
所以少拿他来说事
So stop using him against me.

75
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,480
好啦  开始吧
Okay, here we go.

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,930
你们发现自己身在一个
You find yourselves in

77
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,720
巨木参天的原始森林里
an overgrown old forest.

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,160
在你们面前  有一棵巨型橡树
Before you is a giant oak tree

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,140
树上有张脸
with a face on it

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,770
看起来很像是尼克拉斯·凯奇哦
that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.

81
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,800
他说"请小心上路
He says, "travel with caution.

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,960
这片森林是许多陨落于此的
These woods are home to the bones

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,930
各路英雄的
of many a fallen...

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,980
埋骨之地"[模仿凯奇声音]
hero!"

85
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,590
你看  霍华德跟我一样好嘛
See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.

86
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,880
什么一样好
As good?

87
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,920
你跟他比差远了  四眼田鸡
You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,410
别吵啦  集中注意力
Hey, come on, guys, focus.

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,250
伟大的尼克拉斯·凯奇树
Oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree,

90
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,280
我们由衷感谢您的提醒
we thank you for your warning,

91
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,170
但我们都是英勇的战士
but we are brave warriors,

92
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,880
任何危难或死亡也阻挡不了我们的决心
and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.

93
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,540
露西又有空了
Oh, Lucy's free after all.

94
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,260
再见
See ya.

95
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,700
你不能说走就走啊
Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave.

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,020
才刚开始玩呢
We just started.

97
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,580
你说得对  我应该玩完才是
You're right, I should finish the game.

98
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,920
我举起我的强化长剑
I take my plus-one long sword,

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,150
朝自己脸上一桶
stab myself in the face with it.

100
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,480
我死了  我要去跟姑娘约会啦
I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl.

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,390
再见
Bye.

102
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,420
没事的  你们看
We'll be fine, watch.

103
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,030
突然  从满是血的
Suddenly, a spectral shape

104
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,240
库萨帕里尸体上  有东西缓缓升起
rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse,

105
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,640
并说道"别担心  兄弟们
and says, "don't worry, buddies,

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,380
拉杰之魂将会
ghost Raj will help

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,070
带领你们走过这片森林
guide you through the forest."

108
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,240
"我只是棵树  但如果我是你
"Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you,

109
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,000
我会听你死鬼朋友的话"
I'd listen to your ghost friend!"

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,160
快  对他俯首称臣吧
Go on, give him your lunch money.

111
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,390
我很开心你今晚有空出来玩
I'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.

112
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,750
我也是
Me, too.

113
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,700
并不是说你是来让我开心的
Not that it's up to you to make me happy.

114
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,460
但如果你觉得求关爱的人很性感
Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy.

115
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,640
这样的话  你将要和
In which case, you're about to have dinner

116
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,810
地球上最性感的男人吃饭了
with the hottest man on the planet.

117
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,750
我可以告诉你件事吗
Can I tell you something?

118
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,520
跟你见面让我非常紧张
I was so nervous about seeing you,

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,570
所以在离开公寓前
before I left my apartment,

120
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,980
我把整管止汗剂抹遍全身
I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.

121
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,510
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

122
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,380
如果汗从我脑袋顶上喷出来
If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head,

123
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,660
你就知道原因了
you'll know why.

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,110
很抱歉让你遭这种罪
I, uh, I'm sorry to put you through that.

125
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,390
没关系啦
Oh, it's okay.

126
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,590
我一直在逼自己
I've been trying to force myself

127
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,580
做一些让我害怕的事情
to do things that make me scared.

128
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,890
比如说还有什么是你想做的
What else have you been thinking about doing?

129
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,420
我想想
Well, let's see.

130
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,300
我很想告诉帮我剪头发的女士
I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair

131
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,580
我不喜欢留刘海
that I don't like bangs.

132
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,010
我喜欢你的刘海
I like your bangs.

133
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,490
谢谢  我也很喜欢
Oh, thanks, I like 'em, too.

134
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,290
还有什么
What else?

135
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,730
似乎这俩难度一样
It's kind of a tie between

136
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,180
在餐馆把菜退回去
sending food back in a restaurant

137
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,110
和拒绝挨家按户兜售杂志的小孩
and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.

138
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,040
是啊  这俩都难以启齿
Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.

139
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,770
就是啊
I know.

140
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,450
我订阅了两年的《枪支与弹药》杂志
I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.

141
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,090
我用肩膀用力去顶那扇密门
I push my shoulder against the secret door

142
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,600
看看能不能推开它
to see if it gives way.

143
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,970
能
It does.

144
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,950
他还会配音效呢
He does sound effects, too!

145
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,470
我也一直有配音效呀
Hey, I always did sound effects.

146
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,220
一大群嗜血蝙蝠飞过地下城
A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.

147
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,370
它们袭击附近的独角兽
Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.

148
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,070
好吧  我也来给你的音效配个音效吧
Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.

149
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,130
猜猜谁回来了
Guess who!

150
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,300
你们怎么回来了
What are you doing back?

151
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,070
问得真好  艾米你说吧
That's an excellent question. Amy?

152
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,180
这个嘛
Uh, well...

153
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,100
在我们过安检的时候
when we were going through security,

154
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,770
我从队伍里被拉出来搜身
I got pulled out of line for a pat-down.

155
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,610
那个
The, uh,

156
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,290
运输安全局的人有点毛手毛脚
TSA agent got a little handsy...

157
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,150
我貌似就用手肘撞断了她的鼻骨
I may have broken her nose with my elbow.

158
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,250
长话短说  她上了禁飞名单
Long story short, she's on the No Fly List

159
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,050
回来时  还可能有一架无人飞机跟着我们
and we might have been followed here by a drone.

160
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,050
对不起嘛
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,450
我感觉自己就像个白痴
I feel like such an idiot.

162
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,680
没那么糟啦
Oh, it's not so bad.

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,290
损失金钱  内心充满耻辱
You lost money, you're filled with shame

164
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,910
还被陌生人摸来摸去
and you got groped by a stranger.

165
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,120
赌城就像这样  你成功了
I mean, that's Vegas, you nailed it.

166
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,710
祝你们今晚过得愉快
You guys enjoy your evening.

167
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,920
我先走了  省得又搞砸其他人的周末
I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.

168
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,310
这样才乖嘛
That's my girl.

169
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,330
不  艾米  别走
No, no. Amy, wait.

170
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,670
我知道今晚没能如你们所愿
Uh, uh, I know it's not the night you had in mind,

171
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,280
但你们何不留下来  跟我们一起玩呢
but why don't you guys stay and play with us?

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,980
-会很好玩哦  -会好玩吗
- It'll be fun. - It would-- fun?

173
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,890
好吧  三周前
Yeah, okay, three weeks ago,

174
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,200
你买了一罐颗粒型花生酱
you bought crunchy peanut butter,

175
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,750
而现在你又让这帮女人跟我们一起玩
but now you want the girls to play D & D--

176
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,000
你是不是吸毒吸傻了
do you have a drug problem?

177
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,810
这有什么关系
What's the big deal?

178
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,190
拉杰开溜了  我们可以找人替他呀
Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.

179
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,660
我只是从来没跟女人一起玩过龙与地下城
Well, I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.

180
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,570
别害怕  小宝贝
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

181
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,420
没人跟女人玩过这个
No one has.

182
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,340
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you say?

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
我把决定权留给地下城主
I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.

184
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,410
好的  一朵长得
Yeah, a... satanic fungus

185
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,640
特别像阿尔·帕西诺[演员]的恶魔菌类
that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino

186
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,180
从森林植被冒出来说
rises from the forest floor and says,

187
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,300
"你来玩龙与地下城
"You're playing D & D.

188
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,620
你也来玩
You're playing D & D.

189
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,580
所有人都来一起玩
This whole apartment...

190
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,240
龙与地下城"
...is playing D & D."

191
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,640
谁想来一杯
Okay, who wants a drink?

192
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
佩妮  我们玩游戏的时候
Yeah, we-- now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol

193
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,690
不能喝酒
during Dungeons & Dragons.

194
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,350
那会影响我们的判断力
It impairs our judgment.

195
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,320
这不是酒
Oh, this isn't alcohol.

196
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,300
这是能让我喜欢你的魔力药水
It's a magic potion that makes me like you.

197
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,040
麻烦给我来双份
Double potion, please.

198
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,480
游戏开始
Okay, here we go.

199
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
你们发现
You find yourselves

200
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,560
迎面走来两个笨重的食人魔
face-to-face with two hulking ogres.

201
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,760
"你们来地下城干什么
"What are you doing in our dungeon?

202
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,940
纳命来"
You shall die!"

203
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,930
我真起鸡皮疙瘩了  看
Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.

204
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,110
你们会怎么做
What do you do?

205
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,930
我会拔出我的剑
I draw my broadsword.

206
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,280
我举好我的魔棒
I ready my quarter-staff.

207
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,570
我会喝我的药水
I drink my potion.

208
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,670
-我说"冲上去揍大的"  -算了
- I say we attack the big one. - You know what?

209
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,950
把骰子给我  我想掷骰子
Give me the dice, I want to roll.

210
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,500
这事应该由地下城主来做
Well, the dungeon master's supposed to roll.

211
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,560
我们还应该在维加斯
Yeah, well I'm supposed to be in Vegas

212
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
吃海鲜自助餐吃到吐的  快给我
throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it.

213
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,530
我得掷多少点
All right, what do I need?

214
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,870
15或大于15
Uh, 15 or higher.

215
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,610
目标15点  就要15点以上
15's the point, the point is 15.

216
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,130
给老娘让点儿地方  准备上啦
Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out.

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,520
16
Sixteen!

218
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,140
真棒
Yes!

219
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,650
快告诉我咱们是玩钱的
Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.

220
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,380
这可比赢钱还好
Oh, even better than money.

221
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,910
你赢得了经验值
You gained experience points.

222
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,210
-麻烦再来点药水  -好
- More potion, please. - Yeah.

223
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,200
你的蟹饼怎么样
How are your crab cakes?

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,420
有点臭
Kind of funky.

225
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,530
-很不错啊  -是吗
- That's great. - It is?

226
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,190
"臭"在印度是另一个意思吗
Does "funky" mean something different in India?

227
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,680
不不
No, no.

228
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,410
你不是一直想在餐馆里把菜退回去吗
Uh, you've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant;

229
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,560
这下机会来了
here's your chance.

230
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,190
没关系  我不吃就是了
It's okay. I just won't eat 'em.

231
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,720
别傻了  服务员
Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?

232
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,300
菜还行吗
Everything all right?

233
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,730
是的
Uh... yeah.

234
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,730
你过得还行吗
Everything all right with you?

235
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,950
是的
Yes.

236
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,140
好的  谢谢  再见
'Kay, thanks, bye.

237
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,570
等一下
Hold on.

238
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,420
你不是有别的事要告诉他吗
Isn't there something else you wanted to tell him?

239
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,440
不  没关系的
N-No, it-it's fine. Uh...

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
他不是美国人  不理解咱们
He's from a different country; he doesn't understand our ways.

241
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,430
别犯傻了  快告诉他吧
Don't be silly. Just tell him.

242
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,110
我得去趟卫生间
I have to go to the bathroom.

243
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,660
绝对不是因为蟹饼有点臭
And it's not because the crab cakes are funky.

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
那您没问题吧
So you're okay here?

245
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,110
是的  抱歉
Uh, yeah, sorry.

246
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,820
她只是太害羞了
She's just a little shy.

247
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,100
我们第一次见面的时候  她因为太过紧张
The-the first time we met, she was so nervous,

248
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,680
为了躲我  甚至从卫生间爬窗逃跑呢
she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.

249
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,950
糟糕
Uh-oh.

250
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,900
拉杰
Hey, Raj.

251
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,840
说来也好笑
Funny story.

252
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,240
加油  老娘要整死几个食人魔
Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres!

253
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,960
17  大个儿的食人魔死了
17! The larger ogre is dead!

254
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,320
另一个食人魔说
The-the other ogre says,

255
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,940
"你杀了我哥哥
"You killed my brother.

256
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,100
食人魔感恩节被毁了"
Now ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."

257
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,580
真是太生动了
That is amazing.

258
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,950
他甚至让我关心起食人魔来了
He made me care about the ogre!

259
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
艾米  还剩一个食人魔
All right, Amy, there's one ogre left.

260
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
-灭了他  -好的
- Take him out! - Okay.

261
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,030
就当是运输安全局的那群人
Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.

262
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,260
19
Nineteen!

263
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,530
太好了
Yes!

264
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,870
没想到这里比去赌城还好玩
This is turning out to be even better than Vegas!

265
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,250
才没有呢
No, it's not!

266
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,120
露西
Lucy?

267
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,220
好久不见
Long time no see.

268
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,950
你不太了解我
You don't know me very well,

269
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,760
每次你从卫生间窗户爬出去
but each time you crawl out a bathroom window

270
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,630
躲避我  我的男子气概都流失许多
to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.

271
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,310
对不起
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,040
你为什么非要这样离开
Why would you leave like that?

273
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,940
是你逼我的
You were pushing me;

274
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,560
我很明显不想把菜退回去
I clearly didn't want to send my food back,

275
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,350
但你还是逼我这么做
and you tried to make me do it anyway.

276
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,040
好吧  如果我让你不高兴了
Okay, if I upset you,

277
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,930
你何不直接对我说呢
then why didn't you just say something?

278
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,160
我怎么能对你直说呢  我甚至不能跟那个
Well, how can I tell you I'm upset if I can't tell the woman

279
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,320
理发店的女人说我的额头是个人亮点来着
at Supercuts that my forehead's my best feature?

280
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,980
这让我很害怕
It's scary.

281
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
我很喜欢你
Yeah, well, I like you a lot,

282
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,780
这也很让我害怕
and that's scary for me.

283
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,820
主要是因为你会随时逃走
Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.

284
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,060
你怎么会特别喜欢我呢
How could you like me a lot?

285
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,760
其中一个是因为
Well, uh, for one thing,

286
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
你的感情问题比我还严重
you have bigger emotional problems than I do,

287
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,070
我觉得这种女孩子特别迷人
and I find that very attractive in a woman!

288
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,230
我也不知道
I-I don't know. I just...

289
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,640
我觉得你特别好
I think you're wonderful.

290
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,160
我的汗都从头顶喷出来了
I'm sweating out of my head.

291
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,490
巨龙从天上坠落
The dragon falls from the sky,

292
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,460
一头栽进了火山岩浆
crashing into the volcano!

293
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,440
等一下
But wait!

294
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
他还没死
He's not dead.

295
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,130
他缓缓爬了出来
He crawls out,

296
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,270
伸展了一下自己的翅膀  准备攻击
spreads his wings and prepares to attack.

297
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,180
等等
Yeah, uh, wait!

298
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,930
他有没有先说点什么呢
Doesn't he say something first?

299
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,430
比如用我们喜欢的名人的声音来说
You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?

300
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
好吧
Fine.

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,740
"瞧  都这么多年了
"You'd think, after all these years,

302
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,010
我明明应该知道别在火山上乱飞的
I'd know not to fly over volcanoes.

303
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,510
瞧我这个大傻冒"
I'm a freaking idiot."

304
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,450
巨龙版的克里斯托弗·沃肯[美国演员]
The dragon's Christopher Walken!

305
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,330
太了不起了
That's perfect.

306
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,360
艾米  该你了
All right, Amy, it's your turn.

307
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,230
我们还需要最后一击
We need one more hit.

308
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,340
-把他了结  -好的
- Finish him off! - Here we go.

309
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,900
15
Fifteen?

310
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,210
攻击成功  巨龙倒在了地上
It's a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground!

311
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,780
等一下
Wait.

312
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,140
等一下
Wait.

313
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,710
他说...
And says...

314
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,470
"妈妈
"Mother?

315
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,540
是你吗
Is that you?

316
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,770
你的小宝贝要回家了"
Your little boy is coming home."

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,220
我不确定你们会不会  我反正今晚
Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through

318
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,100
今晚我是大喜大悲到精疲力竭了
the emotional wringer tonight.

319
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,460
我可能是药水喝多了
This may be the potion talking,

320
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,630
但你真是个厉害的地下城主
but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.

321
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,350
是吗  我们回家后
Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home,

322
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,560
我会你带"体验"另一种完全不同的冒险
I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.

323
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,610
沃罗威茨主持的另一探险  加我一个
Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.

324
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,430
谢尔顿  他们说的是上床
Sheldon, they're talking about sex.

325
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,400
那我不玩了
Oh, then I'm out.

326
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,230
我有个主意
Ooh! I have an idea.

327
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,200
反正这事最近也不会成真
Since it's not happening anytime soon,

328
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,730
不如你的角色和你的角色
why don't your character and your character

329
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,240
在游戏中来一炮
do it in the game?

330
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,380
来声援一下
Come on, back me up here.

331
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,310
我对谢尔顿和艾米施爱情咒
Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.

332
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,900
不好意思  以为你们还会这样
Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that...

333
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,470
爱情咒起作用了
The love spell takes effect.

334
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,590
谢尔顿看向艾米时
When Sheldon looks at Amy,

335
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,170
发现她是他生平见过最美丽的半兽人
she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen,

336
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,490
他心里阵阵欲望涌现
and he's overcome with a desire

337
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,010
只想扯开她的盔甲
to rip her armor off

338
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,130
温柔地凝视她那四个毛茸茸的咪咪
and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.

339
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,920
艾米眼中的谢尔顿  他看起来就像是
When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks...

340
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,620
谢尔顿这个样子  因为她就好这口
well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that.

341
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,470
你们会怎么做
What do you do?

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,650
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

343
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,010
就说让女人玩龙与地下城不好吧
You see what happens when you let girls play D & D?

344
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,400
艾米
Amy.

345
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,950
艾米
Amy.

346
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,740
艾米
Amy.

347
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,530
什么事
What?

348
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,620
我从来没敲过自己房间的门
I've never knocked on my own door before.

349
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,720
真够刺激的
That was a wild ride.

350
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,280
你不用进来安慰我
You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.

351
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,380
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,770
你能出来告诉其他人吗
Would you go tell everyone else that?

353
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,760
因为他们可不是这么想
Because they sure think otherwise.

354
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,110
我告诉你他们是怎么想的
I'll tell you what they think.

355
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,110
他们觉得我们的恋爱关系是一个笑话
They think our relationship is a joke.

356
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,820
我不觉得我们的恋爱关系是一个笑话
Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke.

357
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,010
我觉得
I think

358
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,310
"一匹马走进酒吧
"A horse goes into a bar,

359
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,040
酒保说  为什么拉长一张马脸[闷闷不乐]"
bartender says, 'Why the long face?'"

360
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,120
这种才是笑话
That's a joke.

361
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,050
还是个非常好笑的笑话  因为马的脸很长
It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.

362
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,960
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

363
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,370
我们到底会不会变成亲密的男女关系
are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?

364
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,320
天啊
Oh, my.

365
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,370
这个话题够尴尬的
That's an uncomfortable topic.

366
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,320
艾米
Amy...

367
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,360
我在认识你之前
before I met you,

368
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,350
我从未有兴趣跟任何人变得亲密
I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.

369
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
现在呢
And now?

370
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,350
现在什么
And now what?

371
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,590
你现在有兴趣了吗
Do you have any interest now?

372
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,040
并不排除这种可能性
I have not ruled it out.

373
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,500
对我开黄腔呢
Talk dirty to me.

374
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,040
我知道你可能不这样想  但是
I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but,

375
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,540
对我来说  我们的关系
for me, what we have

376
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,600
已经是极度亲密了
is extremely intimate.

377
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,300
我想我知道
I guess I know that.

378
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,630
只是
It's just...

379
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,500
我的内心想要更多
part of me wants more.

380
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,910
更多
More?

381
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,220
瞧瞧咱们
I mean, look at us.

382
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,360
才三年时间  就已经在床上了
It's only been three years; here we are in bed together.

383
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
走吧
Come on.

384
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,110
我们出去吧
Let's go back out there.

385
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,000
不  等等
Y... Well, no. Hold on.

386
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,910
我的精灵魔法师和你的半兽人战士
My elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior

387
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,960
的确是被施了爱情咒
did have a love spell cast on them.

388
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,110
如果不继续玩下去
We wouldn't really be playing the game right

389
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,850
就是没遵守游戏规则
if we didn't see that through.

390
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,320
好吧
Okay.

391
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,150
我们刚刚杀了一条龙
I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.

392
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,590
其他人在捡尸体上的宝物时
While the others pillage the corpse,

393
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,900
我将你带到一个隐蔽的区域
I lead you to a secluded area

394
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,480
在那里  我想脱掉你的皮革盔甲
where I attempt to remove your leather armor.

395
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,680
脱掉了
It comes off.

396
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,610
你怎么做
What do you do?

397
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,860
我
I...

398
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,470
吻上你的嘴唇
...kiss you... on the lips.

399
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,280
我回吻你的...
I kiss you back on the...

400
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,860
嘴唇
...lips as well.

401
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,510
到你了
Your turn.

402
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,280
我脱掉了你的盔甲
I... remove your armor.

403
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,770
你会怎么做
What do you do?

404
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,260
我饥渴地爱抚你的
I... erotically caress your...

405
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,310
-鼻子  -继续扔
- ...nose. - Keep rolling.

406
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,820
你们已经在里面好一会儿了
Hey, you guys have been in there for a while.

407
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,580
-还好吗  -挺好的  多谢
- You doing okay? - We're fine, thank you.

408
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,540
我们只想说  我们非常抱歉刚才
Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about...

409
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,640
走开  谢尔顿正准备轻咬我的...
Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my...

410
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,100
14  太棒了
14! Yes!
