1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,290
下一个结婚礼品是
And the next wedding gift is

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,660
调味肉汁壶
a gravy boat.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,740
挺好  肉汁壶一个
Ooh, one gravy boat.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,880
那是谢尔顿送的哦
That's from Sheldon.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,310
他说他还在上面刻字了
He told me he had it engraved.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,190
"如不幸离婚
"In the event of a divorce,

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,700
请物归原主"
please return to Sheldon Cooper."

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,110
"乱来
One "Inappropriate,

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,680
而我却当初没想到"的调味肉汁壶一个
yet I wish I thought of that" gravy boat.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,370
等我结婚  我要去洛杉矶加州大学
When I get married I'm going to register

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,360
尸体实验室登记礼物
at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,210
恶心  为什么呀
Ew, why?

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,910
我一直想要一副人体骨架
'Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,140
但那个真的好贵
and they are really spendy.

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,420
所以  你真的觉得你和谢尔顿会有天结婚吗
So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,760
不是有天
Not just someday.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,700
确切说来是四年后
In exactly four years.

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,710
但先别给谢尔顿漏口风
But don't tell Sheldon.

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,630
他还是只会飞的鸭子呢
He's still a flight risk.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,200
那你呢  佩妮
What about you, Penny?

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,090
我怎么了
What about me what?

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,780
你觉得你会跟莱纳德结婚吗
Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,100
这个嘛
Oh, well, you know,

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,430
莱纳德是个好男人
Leonard is great.

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,710
你觉得你们会结婚吗
But do you think you'll ever get married?

26
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,340
他很贴心哦
He's a sweetie.

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,060
你在顾左右而言他
You're not answering the question.

28
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,100
你爱他吗
Do you love him?

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,700
当然  我当然爱他啊
Yeah, sure, of course I love him.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,870
听起来不太像啊
It doesn't sound like it.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,930
但我的确爱他啊
Well, I do.

32
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,790
你有对他说吗
Do you tell him that?

33
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,710
没  他一定会理解错的
No, he'd just take it the wrong way.

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,150
你什么意思
What does that mean?

35
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,980
我的意思是他很特别  有才  人好
It means he is special and smart and nice and...

36
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,160
-你要跟他分手啦  -没有啊
- Are you gonna break up with him? - No!

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,230
可能吧  我也不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,090
我不知道原来你爱得不开心
I had no idea you were unhappy.

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,140
重点就在这  我没有不开心
That's the thing: I'm not.

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,810
我完全没有不开心  只是...
I'm not unhappy at all. It's just... I don't know...

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,990
我以前也爱过  但感觉跟现在不一样
I-I've been in love before, but it felt different.

42
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,470
这可能是一段全新更好  但无聊的爱情
But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love.

43
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,640
你对霍华德有过这种感觉吗
Do you ever feel that way about Howard?

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,530
拿我男人跟你男人比不太公平啊
Oh, that's not really a fair comparison.

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,450
我嫁的可是性感版的巴斯光年
I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.

46
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,600
艾米  你呢
Amy, you?

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,590
这我也回答不了
Can't help ya, kid.

48
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,750
待在谢尔顿身边的每分每秒
Whenever I'm around Sheldon,

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,920
胯下都如同火焰在烧
I feel like my loins are on fire.

50
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,180
是欲火
In the good way.

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,740
不是尿路感染的灼烧感
Not the urinary tract infection way.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,200
生活大爆炸 第六季第二集

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,570
兄弟  你在上面好吗
Hey, buddy, how's it going up there?

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,620
拉杰  你不用大声吼啦
You don't have to shout, Raj.

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,300
我又不是什么飘浮在外太空的宇航员
It's not like I'm an astronaut floating around in outer space.

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,180
不对  我还真是啊
Oh, wait, I am.

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,100
那里是否就像你梦想中那样
So, is it everything you hoped it would be?

58
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,340
棒多了
It's better.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,160
每早醒来  我还是不敢相信
I wake up every morning and I just can't believe

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,550
我有幸来到这美妙的旅途上
I'm on this incredible adventure.

61
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,640
果麦圈客
Hey, Froot Loops,

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,610
你去刷马桶了吗
did you clean the space toilet?

63
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,570
拜托  我在跟我朋友说话呢
Excuse me. I'm talking to my friends.

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,300
规矩你懂  新人负责刷马桶
You know the rules: new guy scrubs the toilet.

65
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,310
你好好干  下次说不定赏你个马桶刷用用
If you do good job, next time we give you brush.

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,610
真会说笑
Funny.

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,150
我们大家都很喜欢闹闹对方
We're always giving each other a hard time up here.

68
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,750
就像在兄弟会一样
It's kind of like being in a frat.

69
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,090
打打闹闹  伤害一下对方心灵
You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,890
好了  轮到我跟他说话了
Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.

71
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,040
说吧说吧
Go ahead.

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,090
2311  北罗伯斯大街
2311 North Los Robles Avenue,

73
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,330
帕萨迪纳市  加州  与国际太空站对话
Pasadena, California to International Space Station.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,760
听到请回答  完毕
Can you read me? Over.

75
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,200
听到你了  谢尔顿
Yes, I read you, Sheldon.

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,590
收到  完毕
Copy that. Over.

77
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,200
你这是在干嘛
What are you doing?

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
我在跟一个身在太空的人说话
I am talking to a man in space.

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,430
不弄那个声音[昆德音調]
If you don't have the
昆德音調:  早期太空任务中对讲器开通与关闭时的声响]

80
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,460
他在太空或是附近的咖啡店又有何区别
then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,990
你疯了吧  谢尔顿
You're out of your mind, Sheldon.

82
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,120
你说得不对  我妈早带我验过了  完毕
That's a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.

83
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,460
快啊  去刷干净  小圈儿
Come on, scrub it up, Loops.

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
好啦好啦
All right, all right.

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,180
我得走了
I gotta go.

86
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,560
要去看流星雨了
There's a meteor shower.

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,520
你想看流星雨吗
You want to see a meteor shower?

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,550
迪米特里在厕所里就给你留了"流星雨"
Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,670
再见啦
Bye.

90
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,950
通话完毕
Over and out.

91
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,820
再见啦  兄弟
Bye, buddy!

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,340
大家好啊
Hello.

93
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,450
斯图尔特  进来吧
Hey, Stuart, come on in.

94
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,700
你来这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,650
拉杰邀请我跟你们一起去看电影
Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.

96
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,450
请问一下
Excuse me.

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,270
我没批准过哦
I didn't authorize this.

98
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,340
谢尔顿  你又不是老大
Sheldon, you are not in charge.

99
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,990
某人马上要接受
That's mighty sassy for a man

100
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,650
室友评测检验了  说这话真是不知死活
with a roommate performance review around the corner.

101
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
带他又怎么样
What's the big deal?

102
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,380
你们都带女朋友去
You guys are bringing your girlfriends.

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,990
问题是我以为今天会是
The big deal is I was expecting us

104
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,930
亲密无间的五人组
to be an intimate group of five.

105
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,440
现在我们就成了
Now, we're going to be a...

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,580
名都叫不出来的六人堆
faceless mass of six.

107
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,940
没事的  就把他当成沃罗威茨吧
It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,610
你喜欢巧克力葡萄干吗
Do you like Raisinets?

109
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,570
不喜欢也不讨厌
I can take them or leave them.

110
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,070
看电影时  沃罗威茨总是吃巧克力葡萄干
At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.

111
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,650
如果我吃  你会比较高兴吗
Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?

112
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,140
你吃什么管我屁事
Well, it's hardly my business what you eat,

113
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,180
只要不发出噪音打扰电影
as long as it doesn't crunch during the film

114
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,750
并且是葡萄干就好
and it's Raisinets.

115
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,600
好吧
Okay.

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,390
我们能走了吗
Should we go?

117
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,700
等等  还有一个问题
Yeah, but, one more question.

118
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,940
如果你想取代沃罗威茨
If you're going to replace Wolowitz,

119
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,260
我还得再深入了解你一点
I need to know a little more about you.

120
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,970
随你
All right.

121
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,910
沃罗威茨念过麻省理工
Wolowitz went to MIT.

122
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,540
你的教育背景是什么
What's your educational background?

123
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,210
我上过美术学校
I went to art school.

124
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,740
都一样可笑  走吧
Equally ridiculous. Let's go.

125
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,230
这种对牵手的坚持实在太荒谬了
This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.

126
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,210
我就喜欢
Well, I like it.

127
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,970
你当然喜欢了
Yeah, of course you do.

128
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,870
你是女生  弱智的事你都喜欢
You're a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.

129
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,620
看你的电影就好
Just watch the movie.

130
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,060
真不公平
It's not fair.

131
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,650
佩妮就不逼莱纳德牵她手
Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.

132
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,700
那是事出有因的
There might be a reason for that.

133
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,240
手汗多
Sweaty?

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,780
不卫生
Unhygienic?

135
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,010
看着傻
Looks dumb?

136
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,270
你选一个吧
Take your pick.

137
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,120
佩妮说她不确定
Penny said she's not sure

138
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,320
自己是否还想和莱纳德继续交往
she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,530
错了  她刚喝了他的低卡胡椒博士汽水
Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.

140
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,710
那又如何
So?

141
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,180
如果她想结束和莱纳德的情侣关系
So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard,

142
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,270
又怎么会去如饮佳酿一般地
why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew

143
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,090
喝下他的汽水与口水呢
of his soda and spit?

144
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,590
个中缘由很复杂
It's complicated.

145
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,910
弦理论才叫复杂
String theory is complicated.

146
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,700
这只是令人作呕
That's just yucky.

147
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,060
想都不要想
Don't get any ideas.

148
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,750
好吧  就当你说的是真的
All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true.

149
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,310
佩妮为什么想结束这段关系呢
Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?

150
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,540
她不太确定自己的感受
She's not sure how she feels.

151
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,290
她怎么能不确定自己的感受呢
How can she not be sure how she feels?

152
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,600
当我有感受的时候  我就很明确
You know, when I have a feeling, I know it.

153
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,330
火车  好喜欢
Trains? Love them.

154
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,690
剑鱼  同样喜欢
Swordfish? I love them, too.

155
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,170
它们可是鼻子配有利剑的鱼
They're fish with a sword for a nose.

156
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,090
无论如何  千万别告诉莱纳德
Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
你这是要我对
Now you're asking me to keep a secret

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,180
我的密友  同事以及室友保守秘密吗
from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?

159
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,490
没错  拜托了  佩妮知道会杀了我的
Yes, please, Penny will kill me.

160
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,060
好吧
Fine.

161
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,590
随便一提  保守秘密   最讨厌了
FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it.

162
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,720
牵手  不喜欢
Hand-holding? Not a fan.

163
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,800
锤头鲨  好喜欢
Hammerhead shark? I love that thing.

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,790
又是一种头上带工具的鱼哦
Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
吃巧克力葡萄干不
Raisinet?

166
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,610
嘘  我们正忙着看电影呢
Shh, we're trying to watch the movie.

167
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,670
他和我们的气场不合
This is not working out with him.

168
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,080
你在干什么
What are you doing?

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,940
我好像有牙垢堆积
I think I might have tartar buildup.

170
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,440
我舌头伸不到以前那么长了
My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,130
也许是你的舌头缩水了
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

172
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,670
没有
Nope.

173
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,140
你绝对想不到这有多烦人
Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.

174
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,770
我已经开始有所体会了
I'm starting to get a sense of it.

175
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,460
别担心  我明天带你去看牙医
Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.

176
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,910
谢了
Thank you.

177
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,100
我很感激你
I appreciate that.

178
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,230
你是个好人  莱纳德
You're good people, Leonard.

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,730
有件事我必须告诉你
There's something I need to tell you.

180
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,740
说吧
Okay.

181
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,090
可我不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

182
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,580
为啥
Why?

183
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,310
我不能说出不能告诉你的原因
I can't tell you why I can't tell you.

184
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,420
所以我有两件事不能告诉你
So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.

185
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,790
我真希望还有更多
I wish there were more.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
晚安
Good night.

187
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,680
抱歉
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,650
-这事实在太重要  -到底什么事
- This is really important. - What is it?

189
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,240
我喜欢变形金刚
I like The Transformers.

190
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,310
你喜欢变形金刚吗
Do you like The Transformers?

191
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,950
你妈到底是带你上哪去检查的
Where exactly did your mother have you tested?

192
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,430
莱纳德
Leonard,

193
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,000
变形金刚告诉我们
The Transformers teach us

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,350
事情的真相往往与其外在表现不同
that things are not always what they appear to be.

195
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,890
你知道  就像
You know, like, uh,

196
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,570
半拖挂卡车可能是外星机器人
a semi truck might be an alien robot,

197
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,340
或者两个热恋中的人可能
or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel

198
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,530
会有不同的感受
differently than they appear to.

199
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,850
又或者一段关于
Or a conversation

200
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,720
变形金刚的对话其实指的是
about The Transformers might actually be

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,140
这客厅里的某位仁兄
about someone in this room.

202
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,160
我暂停一下以便你想一下
I'm going to pause to let that sink in.

203
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,970
-我想我听懂了  -真的吗
- Okay, I think I understand. - You do?

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,250
你就是那个仿佛无血无泪的机器人的仁兄
The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you...

205
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,330
但你和艾米的感情正让你变成
but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform

206
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,150
一个有血有肉有性欲的人
into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.

207
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,830
这真是我听过最愚蠢的言论了
That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

208
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,120
莱纳德
Leonard?

209
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,730
莱纳德
Leonard.

210
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,260
莱纳德
Leonard?

211
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,190
干嘛
What?

212
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,500
你睡觉了吗
Are you sleeping?

213
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,420
本来是  现在我要做恶梦了
I was. Now I'm having a nightmare.

214
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,530
你要干嘛
What do you want?

215
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,860
算了  我还是不能告诉你
Never mind. I still can't tell you.

216
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,790
佩妮
Penny?

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
佩妮
Penny.

218
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,460
佩妮
Penny.

219
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,490
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

220
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,340
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

221
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,520
你吓死我了
You frightened me.

222
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,490
你在我卧室干嘛
What are you doing in my bedroom?

223
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,890
我刚有敲过大门啊
Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door,

224
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,090
可你没听见
but you didn't hear it.

225
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,330
你是怎么进来的  你个怪胎
How did you even get in, you weirdo?

226
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,530
是吗
Yeah, really?

227
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,990
多年来  不断有陌生男人进出你家
I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years,

228
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,160
可当是我时  就奇怪了
but when I do it, it's weird?

229
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,100
你要干嘛  谢尔顿
What do you want, Sheldon?

230
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,550
我有一点点睡不着
Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping

231
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,710
然后我就想
and I just thought,

232
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,370
反正你醒了  我们来聊聊吧
uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.

233
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,810
聊什么
Talk about what?

234
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,110
不知道耶
Oh, I don't know.

235
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,520
天气  可以拿来做木工活的鱼类
Uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with.

236
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,850
为什么莱纳德是一个这么迷人
Why Leonard is such an attractive

237
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,420
又称心的男友
and desirable boyfriend.

238
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,410
你选一个  由你做主
Yeah, pick one-- your choice.

239
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,170
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

240
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,890
你知道莱纳德的驾驶记录超完美
Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record

241
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,380
因此能享受到车险打折这件事吗
and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that?

242
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,790
很棒吧
Hubba-hubba.

243
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,450
-好吧  快回家  你个疯子  -对了
- Okay, go home, crazy man. - Yeah.

244
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,220
你知不知道
Did you know that

245
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,080
虽然莱纳德在我们国家不算高大
while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country,

246
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,350
但在今日的朝鲜  他绝对是标准身高
in today's North Korea, he's downright average.

247
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,060
正所谓乘龙佳婿啊
Talk about a keeper.

248
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,420
好吧  艾米跟你说什么了
Okay, what did Amy tell you?

249
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,730
太棒了
Oh, very well.

250
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,260
你再不猜出来我也编不出提示了
I can't keep up this clever charade any longer.

251
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,680
她告诉我
She told me

252
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,030
你想跟莱纳德分手
that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.

253
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,220
好吧  你听我说
Okay, you listen to me.

254
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,720
你想保护你朋友的做法真的很有爱
I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend,

255
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,730
但这不关你的事  明白了吗
but this is none of your business. Got it?

256
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,310
纠正一下  这不是为了保护我的朋友
Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend.

257
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,070
我是喜欢内稳态
I'm a big fan of homeostasis.

258
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,360
你知道这是什么意思吗
Do you know what that is?

259
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,950
-当然不知道  -好吧
- Of course not. - Yeah.

260
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,830
内稳态是指一个系统
Homeostasis refers to a system's ability

261
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,920
调节自身内部系统的能力
to regulate its internal environment

262
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,660
并维持其属性在一个常规的状态下
and maintain a constant condition of properties

263
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,920
就好像温度或酸碱度
like temperature or pH.

264
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,740
史上最烂的床边故事
Worst bedtime story ever.

265
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,730
我想说的是
My point is

266
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,520
我不喜欢事物发生变化
I don't like when things change.

267
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,910
所以无论你心里想什么
So, regardless of your feelings,

268
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,370
我希望你能跟莱纳德保持现状
I would like you to continue dating Leonard.

269
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,640
还有
And also,

270
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,280
说到改变  你最近换了不同味的洗发精
while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo.

271
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,700
我不喜欢这个新香味
I'm not comfortable with the new scent.

272
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,420
麻烦别瞎换  用回青苹果味的
Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.

273
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,570
好吧  宝贝  我有很多事情琢磨
Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out,

274
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,020
但在我想清之前  你不许告诉莱纳德一个字
and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard.

275
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,610
-明白了吗  -明白
- Do you understand? - I do.

276
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,530
-那洗发精的事情你明白了吗  -快滚
- You clear on the shampoo issue? - Get out.

277
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,960
-佩妮  -干嘛
- Penny? - What?

278
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,720
拜托不要伤害我的朋友
Please don't hurt my friend.

279
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,070
-这是我最不想做的事情  -谢谢
- That is the last thing I want to do. - Thank you.

280
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,140
椰子味  你想什么呢
Coconut? What were you thinking?

281
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,810
-你又不是跳草裙舞的  -快滚回家
- Are you a hula girl? - Get out!

282
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,370
你好
Hello?

283
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,780
你是怎么想的  居然告诉谢尔顿
What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon?

284
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,990
你知道你把我置于一个多糟糕的处境吗
Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?

285
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,130
等下
Hang on, please.

286
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,590
你好
Hello?

287
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,050
提醒你一下
Yeah, just a heads-up:

288
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,080
佩妮知道你泄露了关于莱纳德的事
Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard.

289
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,590
她气疯了
She's pretty mad.

290
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,800
我知道
I know.

291
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
她现在打电话嚷我呢
She's yelling at me right now.

292
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,880
好吧  你都知情了就好
All right then, so we're all on the same page.

293
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,060
好啦
Yeah.

294
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,670
小妮妮
Hey, Bernie.

295
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,010
我的老公仔
There's my hubby.

296
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,640
在上面一切还好吗
How's everything going up there?

297
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,400
还好啊
Oh, it's okay.

298
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,670
太空很美丽
Space is beautiful.

299
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,000
地球很漂亮  一切还是老样子
Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.

300
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,030
-怎么了  -没事啊
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

301
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,420
一切都好
Everything's fine.

302
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,930
霍华德
Howard.

303
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,570
其他宇航员都欺负我
The other astronauts are being mean to me.

304
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,910
不是吧  他们怎么欺负你了
No, what are they doing?

305
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,980
像那天我还在睡觉
Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep,

306
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,590
其中一个出去太空漫步
one of the guys went on a space walk

307
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,470
然后在我窗外粘了大眼橡胶外星人的面具
and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window.

308
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,310
我醒来后  大概尖叫了九分钟
When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.

309
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,080
可怜的华仔
Oh, Howie.

310
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,350
你想看的话看得到  视频网站有
You can see it if you want. It's on YouTube.

311
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,970
只需搜索"宇航员尖叫九分钟"
Google "Astronaut screams for nine minutes."

312
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,160
你为什么不跟他们讲道理呢
Why don't you stand up to them?

313
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,400
我该说什么呢
What am I supposed to say?

314
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,040
不知道
I don't know.

315
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,800
就说  "欺负人不好
Say, "Being mean is lame.

316
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,260
对人友善才酷"
What's cool is being nice."

317
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,700
哪天我想被人欺负到死
Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy

318
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,580
我就会说的
in space to get a wedgie.

319
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,710
要我打电话找太空总署的人吗
Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?

320
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,200
不用
No.

321
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,430
我妈已经打过了
My mom already tried that.

322
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,140
完全是火上浇油
It only made things worse.

323
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,310
粘性之球
Gelatinous Sphere.

324
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,000
专心蝗虫
Focused Locust.

325
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,020
叶氏圣殿
Temple of Yip.

326
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,700
抱歉  沃罗威茨绝不会出这张牌
I'm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.

327
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,790
好吧  幼年恶魔龟
All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.

328
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,920
妖精神怪  我赢了
Fairy God Monster, I win.

329
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,040
你对友谊的渴求令你破绽百出
Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.

330
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,730
你们等下做什么
So, what are you guys doing later?

331
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,300
斯图尔特和我打算出去喝一杯
Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.

332
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,690
我们打算去泡妞
We're gonna try to meet some girls.

333
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,470
因为我们是采花高手
'Cause that's what we do.

334
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,160
小心了  女士们
Watch out, ladies:

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,370
咖啡奶油黑白配来啦
a little coffee and cream coming your way.

336
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,340
怕你们不懂  咖啡是我
In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.

337
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,510
莱纳德
Leonard?

338
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,380
不如你也和他们出去泡下妞吧
Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.

339
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,560
我怎么会有兴趣  我有佩妮
Why would I be interested? I have Penny.

340
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,550
暂时有而已
Yeah, for now.

341
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,120
那女人可不是省油的灯  莱纳德
But that woman has a death wish, Leonard.

342
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,360
她跟陌生人讲话  她会逗陌生的狗
She talks to strangers; she pets unfamiliar dogs;

343
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,740
而且闯进她的卧室
and it is ridiculously easy

344
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,750
实在是莫名其妙的容易
to break into her apartment.

345
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,030
如果我是你
If I were you,

346
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,280
我会准备个后备
I'd get a back-up.

347
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,810
你不能用随便碰到的人取代
You can't just replace someone you care about

348
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,730
你喜欢的人
with some other random person.

349
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,380
拜托别破坏我的美梦
No, please don't ruin this for me.

350
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,170
你还记得启用爱德华·诺顿
Do you remember how upset I was

351
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,150
出演绿巨人的时候我有多愤怒吗
when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?

352
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,630
记得  你嘟哝了一个星期说
Yes, you walked around for a week saying,

353
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,290
"谢尔顿对选角不满意"[绿巨人语气]
"Sheldon unhappy with casting choice."

354
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,960
但马克·鲁法罗出演《复仇者联盟》里的
But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers,

355
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,650
绿巨人时效果却更好
and he was even better.

356
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,640
你想说什么
What's your point?

357
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,170
就当我是浪漫主义者吧
Call me a romantic.

358
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,000
我觉得
I like to think

359
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,390
你还没碰到你的"马克·鲁法罗"呢
that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.

360
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,510
真是莫名其妙  到底还要不要打牌
This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?

361
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,560
我也喜欢马克·鲁法罗
I like Mark Ruffalo, too.

362
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,580
有节操点  伪沃罗威茨
Yeah, settle down there, Fake Wolowitz.

363
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,690
没人喜欢马屁精
No one likes a kiss-up.

364
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,290
我今早带了谢尔顿去看牙医
So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.

365
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,430
-是吗  -对
- Really? - Yup.

366
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,500
我跟他说  如果他不咬牙医
I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist,

367
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,170
我就带他去吃冰淇淋
I'd take him for ice cream.

368
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,340
他咬了  我就省了一顿冰激凌
I didn't have to take him for ice cream.

369
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,090
你还好吗
You okay?

370
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,440
感觉有点心不在焉
You seem a little distracted.

371
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,670
听我说  我要跟你说件事
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

372
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,500
好的
Yeah, okay.

373
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,270
我真不知道该如何开口
I don't really know how to say this.

374
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,710
直说吧
Just say it.

375
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,700
好吧  那我就说了
Okay. Here goes.

376
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,850
你跟他上床了
You slept with him?

377
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,470
我不知道还能怎么办嘛
I didn't know what else to do.

378
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,840
他用可怜的星星大眼看着我
He had those big, sad eyes.

379
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,030
是啊  你也是"别无选择"
Oh, sure, you had no choice.

380
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,650
他这样看着我
He looked at me like this.

381
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,350
这样就能拐你上床
Well, if that's all it takes,

382
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,200
那真是幸好你没养狗
it's a good thing you don't have a dog.

383
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,450
别担心
Don't worry.

384
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,700
你多的是能跟他分手的机会
You'll have plenty of chances to break up with him:

385
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,180
你们的大喜之日  蜜月旅行
Your wedding day, your honeymoon,

386
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,950
金婚纪念日
your 50th anniversary.

387
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
没事的
Look, it's fine.

388
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,310
我们不会结婚的  明白吗
We're not getting married, okay?

389
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,100
我们会保持内稳态
We're keeping things, you know, homeostasis.

390
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,370
她硬学那些词的样子好可爱
It's so cute when she tries.

391
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,710
莱纳德发来的
It's from Leonard.

392
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,230
昨晚妙不可言
"Last night was amazing.

393
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,260
你也妙不可言
You're amazing.

394
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,050
我真幸运  人生中有你相伴"
I'm so lucky to have you in my life."

395
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,410
好啦  别闹了
Okay, stop it.

396
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,890
小妮妮  你猜怎么样
Hey, Bernie, guess what?

397
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,150
我照你说的  跟其他宇航员摊牌
I stood up to the other astronauts like you said

398
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,900
我得跟你说  昨晚是我这一周来
and I got to tell you, last night was the first time

399
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,310
第一次睡个安稳觉
in a week I got a good night's sleep.

400
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,520
华仔
Oh, Howie.

401
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,650
怎么啦  你一脸不开心的样子
What's wrong? You look upset.

402
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,340
没有啊  这是我为你骄傲的表情
Nope, this is my proud face.

403
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,610
果麦圈客[操小圈儿]
F有fruit  也有fuck的意思
