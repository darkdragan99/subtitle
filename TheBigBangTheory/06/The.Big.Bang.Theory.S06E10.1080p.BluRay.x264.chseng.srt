1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,010
你们有人觉得蜘蛛侠的主题曲很闹心吗
Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,430
那首怎么会让你闹心啊
Why would it trouble you?

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,800
那不是你第三喜爱的卡通主题曲吗
It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,330
的确是  就排在
It is, right behind

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,500
* 嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟  G型神探 *
* Do do-do do-do, Inspector Gadget... *

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,470
以及  * 忍者神龟 *
and... * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles *

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,250
* 背有龟壳大英雄 *
* Heroes in a half-shell *

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,060
* 忍者龟力量 *
* Turtle power! *

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,960
但蜘蛛侠的歌词却唱  "蜘蛛侠
However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that "Spider-Man,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,860
蜘蛛侠  蜘蛛能做的他都能"
Spider-Man does whatever a spider can."

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,160
那又如何
Yeah, so?

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,730
但我能想到一堆蜘蛛能做到
I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,390
而他不能的事
that a spider can.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,380
一  爬进你耳朵  死在里面
One: crawl in your ear and die.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,330
二  不出示护照也能合法离开危地马拉
Two: legally leave Guatemala without a passport.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
三  跟母蜘蛛做爱
Three: have sex with a spider.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,860
我们能换一个话题吗
Can we change the subject?

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,920
人家铁汉怕怕蜘蛛
Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,910
是铁汉"犹怕"蜘蛛
It's "heebie-jeebies."

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,110
有个"犹"字  感觉歧视犹太人
I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,440
我是在想  我们今晚可以来个小电影节
Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,850
主题  把系列搞臭的电影
The theme: movies that killed their franchises.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,960
例如《大白鲨4》《印第安纳琼斯4》《超胆侠1》
Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,730
还有《特工佳丽2  火爆特工》
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,170
连我的宝贝桑德拉·布洛克都救不起
I mean, you know a movie's bad

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,310
你就知道这烂片有多烂了
when my homegirl Sandy B. can't save it.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,850
佩妮今晚要工作  我参加
Penny's working tonight; I'm in.

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,900
我不行  我得跟伯纳黛特
Not me. I'm having dinner

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,690
还有她父母共进晚餐
with Bernadette and her parents.

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,020
有意思  我们都知道你多"爱"这档事
Fun. We know how much you love that.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,960
太折磨我了
It's torture.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,080
尤其是跟她爸相处
Especially with her dad.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,650
我们没有任何共同点
We have nothing in common.

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,420
当我被逼着跟智商低我太多的人聊天时
You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,070
你知道我都怎么做吗
with those beneath my intellectual station?

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,610
我会提出一个有趣的话题
I bring up an interesting topic,

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,320
例如蜘蛛侠与蜘蛛的差别
like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
谢谢你啊  谢尔顿
Thanks, Sheldon.

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,910
我到时再跟我岳父试试
I'll try that with my father-in-law.

40
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,820
你不许用这话题  这是我的招
No, you can't use that one. That's mine.

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,810
试试用这个话题暖场吧
Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker.

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,990
尽管坊间许多谣传  事实上
Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place

43
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,570
无论从美国本土  阿拉斯加  还是夏威夷
in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii

44
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,850
你都不可能垂直挖出一条能贯穿地球
from which one can dig straight through the center of the earth

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,550
穿到中国的通道
and come up in China.

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,990
很好  谢谢啦
Great, thank you.

47
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,580
不行  这个你也不许用
Actually, you can't have that one either.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,030
这也是个好话题  抱歉啦
It's too good. Sorry.

49
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,530
你呢  谢尔顿
What about you, Sheldon?

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,790
今晚有任何安排吗
Do you have any plans tonight?

51
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,140
很遗憾  我有呢
Sadly, yes.

52
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,750
艾米要拉我去参加一个丧礼
Amy's taking me to a memorial service.

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,720
是她一个有亚洲血统的同事丧礼
It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent,

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,090
所以我聊天时就打算不经意地提到
so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that

55
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,150
无论他们从那人的坟挖多深下去
no matter how deep they dig his grave,

56
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,730
他永远也回不到中国
he'll never make his way back to China.

57
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,100
这应该能让气氛"轻松不少"啊
That should lighten the mood.

58
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,250
哥就是厉害
What can I say?

59
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,340
总能把丧事变喜事
I put the "fun" in funeral.

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,490
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十集

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,910
艾米  艾米
Amy. Amy.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,820
忘了是要去丧礼
Oh, right, funeral.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,070
艾米
Amy.

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,220
你来啦  谢尔顿
Hello, Sheldon.

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,460
我想打银影侠的领带都不行
I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie,

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,980
你却可以穿浴袍啊
but you can wear a bathrobe?

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,850
我病得太厉害  去不了了
I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.

68
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,190
你病啦
You're sick?

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,780
真可怜
You poor kid.

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,320
那我走啦
Well, see ya.

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,970
谢尔顿  你不留下来照顾我吗
Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,470
我吗  不啊
Me? No.

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,470
我是"博士生"不是"医生"
No, I'm not that kind of doctor.

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,860
但是我们的恋爱合同中明确写道
But our relationship agreement clearly states

75
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,010
其中一人若是病了  另一方就得照顾对方
that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.

76
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,990
我明白你的疑惑
Oh, I see the confusion.

77
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,910
那个条款的用意是要
No, the intent behind that clause

78
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,590
强迫你在我生病的时候照顾我
was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill.

79
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,950
等你身体好点  就能理解箇中幽默了
When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.

80
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,110
算了  晚安吧  谢尔顿
Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

81
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,600
艾米  艾米  艾米
Amy. Amy. Amy.

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,950
我曾白纸黑字地同意过
I made a commitment in writing

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,070
要在这样的情况下照顾你
to comfort you in times like this.

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,120
而且  你也是我女朋友
Additionally, you are my girlfriend,

85
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,230
我在乎你的幸福安康
and I care about your well-being.

86
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,730
谢尔顿  谢谢你
Thank you, Sheldon.

87
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,110
不客气
You're welcome.

88
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,910
那咱们速战速决吧
Now let's get this over with.

89
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,860
近来如何
So, how have you been?

90
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,340
还行
Fine.

91
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,840
不错
Good.

92
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,840
还行就不错了
Fine is good.

93
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,150
还享受退休生活吗
How you liking retirement?

94
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,030
还行啦
It's fine.

95
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,500
这让我想到
I'm sensing a theme.

96
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,340
您认真想过蜘蛛侠的主题曲内容吗
You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song?

97
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,050
晚餐做得如何了
How's that dinner coming?

98
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,700
刚放进去烤  还得好一阵呢
I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,930
我就爱吃生鸡肉
I like rare chicken.

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,480
咱们来大快朵颐吧
Let's do this.

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,430
会吃死人的
You could die.

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,650
吃鸡吃死
Death by chicken.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,150
挺"鸟"的一种死法啊
That's a pretty "fowl" way to go.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,600
再给你来瓶啤酒  亲爱的
Here's another beer, honey.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,070
谢谢
Thank you.

106
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,990
罗斯滕科斯基太太
So, Mrs. Rostenkowski,

107
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,640
听说你去大峡谷国家公园玩了
you took that trip to the Grand Canyon.

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
好玩吗
How was it?

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,180
好玩
It was good.

110
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,020
才意识到原来您是健谈的那个
Had no idea you were the chatty one.

111
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,530
102.2华氏度[39度]
102.2.

112
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,070
跟半小时前一模一样
Exactly what it was half an hour ago.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,340
好像你一点都不想好转一样
It's like you're not even trying to get better.

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,510
谢尔顿  流感哪能过半小时就好啊
Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
你这种态度怎么好
Well, not with that attitude.

116
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,810
我不得不说
I have to say,

117
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,330
我觉得你对病人的态度不够耐心
I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.

118
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,720
抱歉嘛
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,330
我只是想你能尽快好起来
I just want you to get better as soon as possible.

120
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,210
抱着这个目标  我要问你个问题
And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question.

121
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,100
你相信安慰剂效应吗
Do you believe in the placebo effect?
病人虽然获得无效的治疗  但却"预料"或"相信"治疗有效
从而让其症状得到舒缓的现象

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,220
当然相信
Of course I do.

123
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,360
很多研究证明了其有效性
There have been many studies proving its validity.

124
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,170
很好
Great.

125
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,200
这可能看似是薄荷糖
Now, this may look like a Tic Tac...

126
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,420
但它其实药效强大  还特别设计成
...but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed

127
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,880
能治疗疾病的同时  帮你清新口气
to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.

128
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,110
谢尔顿  这一点帮助都没有
Sheldon, this isn't helping.

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,130
你何不就让我睡一会呢
Why don't you just let me get some rest.

130
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,650
你怎么能睡觉呢
How can you sleep?

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,570
为了让你感觉好点  我还有好多事要做呢
I'm not done making you feel better.

132
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,870
我还得在你额头放一块冷毛巾
I still have to put a cold rag on your head,

133
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,110
唱歌给你听  帮你在胸口擦伤风膏
sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.

134
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,430
你要帮我在胸口擦东西
Y-You want to rub something on my chest?

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,730
是啊
Yes.

136
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,780
整个胸口都得擦
All over it.

137
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,070
或许我们应该从那个开始
Maybe we should start with that.

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,310
现在你才是个尽责的病人
Now you're being a responsible patient.

139
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,560
你可能会有些刺激感
Now, you may notice some tingling.

140
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,730
不刺激还不要呢
Oh, I'm counting on it.

141
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,200
好了  开动吧
Okay, dig in.

142
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,520
慢着
Hold up.

143
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,070
主  求你降褔我们
Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts

144
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,620
並降褔你惠赐的这次晚餐
which we are about to receive from Thy bounty

145
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,260
我们的主基督  阿门
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

146
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,840
把我想说的话抢了
Took the words right out of my mouth.

147
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,040
爸  你最近有去钓鱼吗
So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,540
下周末去
I'm going next weekend.

149
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,630
你喜欢钓鱼啊
Oh, you like to fish?

150
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,950
是啊
Yes.

151
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,420
也是  我能从你声音听出来
Sure. I can hear it in your voice.

152
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,090
如果他不喜欢  就不会去了
Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.

153
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,750
我还真没想到这点
You know, I hadn't thought of that.

154
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,130
救我
Help me.

155
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
爸  有时间你可以带霍华德一起去啊
Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime.

156
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
让你们俩有机会更了解对方
Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,210
不  不用了
No, no.

158
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,840
我们已经够了解对方了
We know each other well enough.

159
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,280
他整个晚上都在叨叨个不停
He's been talking my ear off all night.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,820
华仔  我觉得你会喜欢的
Howie, I think you'd have fun.

161
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,160
好吧  你可以跟着去
Fine, you can tag along.

162
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,200
太棒了
Terrific.

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,550
我最爱的两个男人一起去钓鱼
My two favorite fellas gone fishin'.

164
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,400
等一下  小妮妮
Well, hang on a second, Bernie.

165
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,220
下周我们有事
Next weekend, we have that thing.

166
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,580
什么事
Whathing?

167
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,590
就是那件事啊
You know, the thing.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,380
那件事啊
Oh, that thing.

169
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,410
没了  我取消了
No, I cancelled that thing.

170
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,060
行  就这么定了吧
All right, it's settled.

171
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,540
-你和我一起去钓鱼  -真好
- You and I are going fishing. - Great.

172
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,900
谢谢你落井下石
Thanks for the help.

173
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,420
我从来没去钓过鱼
I've never even been fishing.

174
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,030
场面肯定会很糟糕
This is gonna be a disaster.

175
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,170
如果不想在干某事时看起来笨手笨脚
If you don't want to look foolish doing something,

176
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,790
你就应该多多练习
you should practice.

177
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,920
你知道在邀请你们来我家之前
Do you know how many beef Wellingtons I made by myself

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,220
我做了多少次惠灵顿牛排吗
before I invited you guys over?

179
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,910
给你们个提示
I'll give you a hint.

180
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,260
你们可以从这里  这里
You can see them here, here...

181
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,590
还有这里看出来
and here.

182
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,600
拉杰说得对
Raj is probably right.

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,810
你应该找人给你些建议
You should get someone to give you some pointers.

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,470
你们俩有谁知道怎么钓鱼吗
Do either of you guys know how to fish?

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,370
不知道
No.

186
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,530
不过如果你真钓到鱼
But if you catch anything,

187
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,170
我知道怎么用香蕉叶子包着蒸
I know how to steam it in banana leaves.

188
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,090
拜托  我们肯定有认识
Come on, we must know somebody

189
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,600
懂这种爷们事情的人
who can do manly stuff like this.

190
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,150
干嘛
What's up?

191
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,250
第一步  虫子
Step 1: worms.

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,420
恶心死了
Ew!

193
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,200
打住  "恶心死了"这句话
Okay, right there, "ew" is one of the things

194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,710
你绝对不能再你岳父面前说
you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law.

195
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,570
一样娘的还有"真讨厌"和"快拿开"这两句
It's right up there with "icky" and "get it away."

196
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,010
拿条虫子起来
Now pick one up.

197
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,970
真的假的
Really?

198
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,530
你钓鱼的时候就得这么做
You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.

199
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,770
好吧
Okay.

200
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,030
你在等什么啊
What are you waiting for?

201
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,350
不知道  等它们自然死亡了再下手抓嘛
I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.

202
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,350
快点挑一条虫子  然后把它弄到鱼钩上
Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.

203
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
好啦
Fine.

204
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
好了
There.

205
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,730
虽然我不是专家
I'm no expert,

206
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,590
但这鱼钩得穿过虫子才行吧
but I think the hook has to go through the worm.

207
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,860
好吧
Fine.

208
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,070
抱歉啦  虫子先生
Sorry, Mr. Worm.

209
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,250
舍尔曼  虫子舍尔曼先生
Sherm. Sherm the Worm.

210
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,790
别给它取名字
Hey, don't name him.

211
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,770
麻利地把鱼钩插穿它脸就对了
Just jab a hook in his face.

212
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,640
你行的  哥们
You got this, buddy.

213
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
是啊  加把油  霍华德  钩穿那条虫
Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.

214
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,920
你行的
You can do it.

215
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,100
不错啊
That's great.

216
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,460
拉拉队加油  你们仨真够"男性雄风"
Cheerleading-- way to man things up.

217
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,240
"随后实验对照组显示了
"And the control group displayed

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,210
基因变异体的大幅减少
significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.

219
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,260
但由于实验环境的设计
But, because of flaws in the experimental design

220
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,600
和喂食环节的缺陷
relating to environment and diet,

221
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,670
它们最终都与世长辞了"
they lived inconclusively ever after."

222
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,790
剧终
The end.

223
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,770
故事真好听
That was great.

224
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,670
再帮我擦擦胸口吧
Rub my chest again.

225
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,910
不行
No.

226
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,650
我得让你睡会儿
I need to get you down for a nap.

227
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,240
不知怎么  那伤风膏让你像打了鸡血一样
For some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.

228
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,950
可怜的小家伙怎么样了
How's the poor thing?

229
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,890
我还撑着呢  谢谢你的关心
Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,570
艾米  我给你带了点
Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs

231
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,390
我们实验室正在研发的药
we were working on in the lab.

232
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,580
这种对鼻塞很有用
This is proving really good for congestion,

233
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,620
但有很小的可能
but there's a slight chance

234
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,360
让你的眼泪有强酸的灼烧感
it can make your tears burn like acid,

235
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,420
吃了药  就求上天保佑吧
so if you take it-- happy thoughts.

236
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,670
我去帮你放一缸能放松身心的水吧
Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath.

237
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,590
你的水温计在哪
Where's your bath thermometer?

238
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,340
我没有水温计
I don't have a bath thermometer.

239
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,360
好吧  那我就帮你放一缸
Fine. Then I'm going to draw you

240
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,580
让神经紧绷的水温不明水吧
a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.

241
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,230
这种药的化痰功能很强
This is a really good expectorant.

242
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,920
不过有些试药员报告说
Although some test subjects reported

243
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,890
她们听到音乐时会忍不住分泌乳汁
lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.

244
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,820
好了  是这么回事
Okay, okay, here's the deal.

245
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
我不需要你的药  我没病
I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.

246
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,110
我不太明白
I don't understand.

247
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,150
我两天前就好多了
I got better two days ago.

248
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,400
但谢尔顿把我照顾得太好了  我舍不得
It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.

249
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,180
所以你就一直骗他啊
So you've just been lying to him?

250
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,750
看我鼻子的东西
See the stuff in my nose?

251
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,040
那是胶水
Rubber cement.

252
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,710
我不是想批评你啦
I don't mean to be judgy,

253
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,470
但这种事不是只有疯子才会做吗
but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.

254
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,470
好吧
All right.

255
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,220
我跟他坦白
I'll tell him.

256
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,460
艾米  你有力气自己洗澡吗
Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself,

257
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,430
还是你需要我帮忙
or do you need my help?

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,630
我明天再坦白
I'll tell him tomorrow.

259
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,980
老娘想好好洗个澡
Mama needs a bath.

260
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,870
现在我们假设奇迹降临
Now, let's assume, by some miracle,

261
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,740
你真的钓上来一条鱼
you actually catch a fish.

262
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,190
你得知道怎样清理内脏
You're going to have to know how to gut it.

263
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,040
所以你要做的就是
So, what you're going to do

264
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,820
拿起刀
is you're going to take your knife,

265
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,000
从它的肚皮上切下去
slice him right up the belly.

266
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,460
要我停下来吗
You want me to stop?

267
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,170
-不  我没事  你继续  -好
- No, I'm fine. Keep going. - All right.

268
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,360
千万别切得太深
Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts,

269
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,820
不然血会溅得你满脸都是
or the blood will just squirt all over your face.

270
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,710
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

271
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,600
你们这群阿宅是怎么回事
What is with you guys?

272
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,610
不是我们的错啊
It's not our fault.

273
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,090
我们的老爸又没和我们做过这些事
Our dads never did anything like this with us.

274
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,220
从来没有过吗
What, never?

275
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,310
我爸爸是个人类学家
My dad was an anthropologist.

276
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,090
我们唯一的父子活动
The only father-son time he spent

277
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,320
都献给那个有两千年历史的
was with a 2,000-year-old

278
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
伊特鲁里亚男孩的尸骸了
skeleton of an Etruscan boy.

279
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,840
我可讨厌那小子了
I hated that kid.

280
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,430
我爸只会带我去他的妇科办公室
Mine just took me to his gynecology office.

281
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,820
我甚至无聊到
I got so bored,

282
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,250
把阴道润滑剂涂在鞋底
I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes

283
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,470
然后幻想我是在滑冰
and pretend I was ice-skating.

284
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,900
我小时候美好的父子时光
Yeah, well, my quality father-son time

285
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,370
都用来盯着窗外
was spending my adolescence looking out the window

286
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,650
等我爸会不会回心转意回家来了
waiting for my dad to come back someday.

287
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,360
好吧  霍华德赢了
Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

288
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,980
也许我们在长大的过程中
You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this

289
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,520
没有这样的机会  但现在
when we were growing up, but right now,

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,370
有位父亲真的要带你去钓鱼了
there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.

291
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,800
你说得对
You're right.

292
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,120
-我得好好学  -很好
- I should do this. - Great.

293
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,520
拿着
Here you go.

294
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,770
你现在要做的是
What you're going to do

295
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,810
把你的手指伸进它的喉咙
is you're going to stick your thumb down its throat,

296
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,310
抓住内脏往外拉
grab the guts and pull.

297
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
我要动手啦
Here we go.

298
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,190
瞧  这是鱼妈妈  快看她产的卵
Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs.

299
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,620
* 在阳光下漫步 *
* I'm walking on sunshine *

300
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,360
* 感觉多么爽快 *
* And don't it feel good *

301
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,690
* 感觉多么惬意 *
* And don't it feel good *

302
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,570
谢尔顿  你可算回来了
Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back.

303
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,690
我又严重了
Taking a turn for the worst.

304
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,190
我觉得你得再帮我洗个澡
I think I'm going to need another bath.

305
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,660
听你这么说真是意外
I'm surprised to hear that.

306
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,540
那天我担心你怎么一直没有好转
See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering,

307
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,840
所以趁你睡觉时
so while you were sleeping,

308
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,490
取了你的唾液样本  到实验室进行细菌培养
I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.

309
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,650
是吗
Oh?

310
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,240
结果出来了
I got the results back.

311
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,370
你有出现如下症状吗
Have you developed any of the following symptoms?

312
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,500
鼻子变长
A growing nose,

313
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,190
或是裤子区域有温热感觉
or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region?

314
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,650
也就是大家熟知的
Also known as full-blown

315
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,250
"撒谎撒谎  裤裆烧光"
"Liar, liar, pants on fire."

316
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,600
好啦  好啦
All right, all right.

317
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,650
但最开始我真的病了
But I really was sick at the beginning.

318
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,340
只是有你照顾我的感觉真是太好了
It's just been so nice having you take care of me.

319
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,210
你骗我  我会伤心的  艾米
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

320
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,800
我以为我们的关系是建立在信任
I thought our relationship was based on trust

321
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,680
以及倾向于对我有利的相互欣赏之上
and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor.

322
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,580
我很抱歉我这么做了
I feel terrible I did this.

323
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,910
尽管这么说我也不好受
It pains me to say it,

324
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,910
但我觉得惩罚是必须的
but I think some form of penalty is in order,

325
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,290
以防日后再出现这样的行为
so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.

326
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,430
这无可厚非  那你想怎么惩罚我
I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?

327
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,870
在理想世界里  我会把你关在
In a perfect world, I'd lock you

328
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,320
广场上的围笼里
in a stockade in the public square.

329
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,540
那可能需要申请准证
That probably requires a permit.

330
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,810
可以不允许我
I could not be allowed

331
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,100
参加下一部《星际迷航》电影的首映啊
to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.

332
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,530
这惩罚也太重了
Oh, that seems overly harsh.

333
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,930
你只是向人性弱点屈服
You gave in to a human weakness.

334
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,720
你又没杀人
You didn't kill a man.

335
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,550
这惩罚可能有点传统
You know, it's a tad old-school,

336
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,550
但我哥溜进我爸的卡车
but my father was not one to spare the rod

337
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,600
偷喝他的驾车威士忌时
when my brother would sneak into his truck

338
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,940
我爸奉行的是"不打不成材"
and drink his driving whiskey.

339
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,710
你是说  你要打我屁屁吗
Are you saying you want to spank me?

340
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,460
我也不想啊
I don't want to.

341
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
但我别无选择了啊
But it looks like you left me no choice.

342
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,820
的确是
That's true.

343
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,810
我是个非常"淘气"的坏女孩
I've been a very bad girl.

344
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,840
走起  走起  咱们去钓鱼
Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.

345
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,340
你穿成这样啊
That's what you're wearing?

346
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,960
不行吗
No good?

347
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,170
体育用品店的人说
The guy at the sporting goods store

348
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,200
钓鱼就要穿这个
said these are what fishermen wear.

349
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,480
在卡通片里差不多
Maybe in cartoons.

350
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
真希望在上传照片
Wish I had known that before I posted

351
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,930
到网上前就知道这点
all those pictures on Facebook.

352
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,600
好了  出发吧
All right, let's hit the road.

353
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,340
大早上去猎几只鸭子也不错
I wouldn't mind shooting some ducks in the morning.

354
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,440
等等  咱们还要猎东西吗
Wait, now we're shooting things?

355
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,790
我喜欢用大口径的子弹
I like using a big shell.

356
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,370
虽然之后没法吃
You can't eat them afterwards,

357
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,990
但打爆它们很有趣
but it's fun watching them blow up.

358
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,570
先生  您邀请我一起去
Sir, I'm flattered

359
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,920
我真是受宠若惊
that you invited me,

360
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,230
我真的很想让您接受我
and I really want you to like me,

361
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,290
但是
but...

362
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,050
我想这趟行程不是什么好主意
I don't think this trip is the way to do it.

363
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,540
而且如果上面满是鸭子残骸
And I can't return these things

364
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,950
我也退不了这身行头
if there's chunks of duck all over them.

365
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,020
那你为什么同意一起去
So, why'd you agree to come?

366
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,050
因为伯纳黛特逼我去
'Cause Bernadette made me.

367
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,930
我也尝试不去
I tried to back out, too.

368
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,390
我老婆也逼我去
My wife said I had to go.

369
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,170
真的吗  您老婆也逼你做事吗
Really? Your wife makes you do stuff?

370
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,190
您可是吓人的大个儿警察
You're a big, scary cop.

371
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,530
你是个宇航员
You're an astronaut,

372
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,290
不也一样被老婆牵着鼻子走
and your wife makes you do things,

373
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,970
而且她只是个小不点
and she's only four feet tall.

374
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,440
那我们现在怎么办
So, what do we do now?

375
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,470
她们是要我们出去玩一整个周末呢
They expect us to go away for the weekend.

376
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,220
棕榈泉附近有家印式赌场
There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs.

377
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,540
双骰会玩吗
You know how to shoot craps?

378
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,010
不会  但我对骰子游戏也略知一二
No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games.

379
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,460
我是希伯来圣地庙学校的"快艇骰"冠军
I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.

380
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,610
恭喜恭喜[希伯来语]
Mazel tov.

381
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,360
我会教你怎么玩
I'll teach you how to play.

382
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,570
真的吗
Really?

383
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,210
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

384
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,990
叫我麦克吧
Call me Mike.

385
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,840
好的
Okay.

386
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,100
老天  我们真是娶了
Oh, boy, we're just married to

387
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,890
两个蛋疼女回家啊  麦克
a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?

388
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,080
你说的可是我的老婆和女儿
That's my wife and daughter you're talking about.

389
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,240
她们是贤良淑德的典范
Great couple of gals.

390
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,250
那又有点过了
I wouldn't go that far.

391
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,890
准备好接受惩罚了吗
Are you prepared to receive your punishment?

392
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,140
等等
One second.

393
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,260
我要放音乐
I want to put on some music.

394
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,550
为什么
Why?

395
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,990
你教训我乖乖听话时
I don't want to disturb the people next door

396
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,060
我不想动静太大扰邻
while you discipline me.

397
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,460
那好吧
Very well, then.

398
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,930
趴我膝盖上  开始了
Get over my knee. Let's begin.

399
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,280
天啊
Oh, my.

400
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,400
正经点
Excuse me.

401
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,980
你不应该觉得享受才对
You're not supposed to be enjoying this.

402
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,920
那你要不要再打大力点
Then maybe you should spank me harder.

403
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,380
也许我会哦
Maybe I will.
