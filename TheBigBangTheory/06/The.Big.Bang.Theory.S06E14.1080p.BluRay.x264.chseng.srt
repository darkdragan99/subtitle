1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,100
谢尔顿  再不吃饭都要凉了
Sheldon, your food is getting cold.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,330
我晚点吃
I'll eat later.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,350
现在我在物理母亲的胸前
Right now, I'm suckling at

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,140
尽情地允吸知识乳汁呢
the informative bosom of mother physics.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,180
谢尔顿满口荤话时真性感
It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,870
我发现一个网站
So, I found this Web site

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,300
只要把自己照片传过去
where you send them pictures,

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,370
他们就会雕刻出你的样子
they sculpt your head

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,250
然后制作一个像你一样的模型人偶
and make an action figure out of you.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,270
超牛逼的  对不对
How awesome is that?

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,410
我看看
Oh, let me see.

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,470
服装任你选
Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,340
甚至连配饰都任你选
You can even choose your accessories.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,950
莱纳德  你还可以配一个哮喘吸入器
Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,630
这真是太妙了
Oh, this is neat.

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,590
想想这些年我们买的模型人偶
Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years.

17
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,160
能拥有像我们自己本人的人偶  还蛮酷的
It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,650
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,110
是啊  如果你"酷"的定义是如此
Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool,

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,800
那你真应该买一个
you should get one.

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,820
好吧  我不买了
Yeah, so, I'm out.

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,320
你觉得呢  谢尔顿
What do you think, Sheldon?

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,490
想要一个像你一样的模型人偶吗
Want an action figure that looks just like you?

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,490
人偶的手有抓握的功能吗
Would it come with kung-fu grip?

25
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,540
没有
No.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,860
那别浪费我的时间
Don't waste my time.

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,880
你懂这是量身定做的独家模型人偶吧
You get that these are personalize action figures.

28
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,180
亲爱的  如果你想要就买吧
Honey, if you want one, just get one.

29
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,910
-你还是不会买的  对吧  -对
-You're still out, right? - Yep.

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,200
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十四集

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,870
场边群众一片肃静
A hush falls over the crowd

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,790
因为库珀在思考
as Cooper studies the board.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,190
他行动了
He makes his move.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,700
他用"I"除以两边
He's dividing both sides by "I."

35
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,030
再加回系数
He's adding back the coefficient.

36
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,330
得到了"P"的值
He has a value for "P."

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,430
再将其导回去
He's plugging that back in.

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,430
他用导数
He takes the derivative,

39
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,900
解出了该等式
and he solves the equation.

40
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,540
群众们疯狂了
The crowd goes wild.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,740
诺贝尔  诺贝尔
Nobel! Nobel!

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,770
库伯
Cooper?

43
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,610
诺贝尔
Nobel.

44
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,630
克莱皮克
Kripke.

45
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,900
不许看我的板子
Don't look at my board.

46
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,070
那是什么
What's that?

47
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,710
一辆超酷的火车
That's a drawing of a really cool train.

48
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,550
那个也不许看
Don't look at that, either.

49
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,780
你来干嘛
What do you want?

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,270
我有个坏消息
I have some bad news.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,130
你在申请基金研究关于聚变反应堆
You're working on a grant proposal for a new fusion reactor.

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,100
我也在申请基金研究关于聚变反应堆
I'm working on a grant proposal for a new fusion reactor.

53
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,740
而我们大学只允许提交一份申请书
The university is only allowed to submit one proposal.

54
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,770
所以他们让你收拾东西走人啊
So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out.

55
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,230
真是非常遗憾  巴里
That's hard cheese, Barry.

56
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,950
你算是有能力的人之一了
You're one of the good ones.

57
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,870
不  大学的意思是让我们一起合作
No, they're making us work together.

58
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,000
真是太过分了
That's ridiculous.

59
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,220
我可是我们这代伟大的思想家
I am one of the great minds of our generation.

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,290
我工作的层次尖端到
I work on a level so rarified

61
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,930
你无法想象
you couldn't even imagine it.

62
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,340
我警告过你  不许看我的火车
I said stop looking at my cool train!

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,440
把你和伯纳黛特的合照
Kind of a strange place

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,450
挂在这地方  有点奇怪啊
to put a picture of you and Bernadette.

65
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,760
我想让大家知道我爱我老婆
Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife.

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,990
同时也不想被人知道  我忘了关激光机
And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.

67
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,550
来了
They're here.

68
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,480
我们的模型人偶到了
Our action figures have arrived.

69
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,210
这是我这辈子花过最值的500块
This is the best $500 I've ever spent.

70
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,640
1千块钱买俩人偶
$1,000 on action figures?

71
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,810
你们怎么可能买得起啊
How can you afford that?

72
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,210
简单  他家超有钱
Easy-- his family's loaded,

73
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,150
伯纳黛特的工作超赚钱
and Bernadette has a great job.

74
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,470
怎样  我老婆有胸又有钱
My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,880
快来跟我的定制人偶打招呼吧
Say hello to an exact scale model of me.

76
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,190
人家的肤色不是黑巧克力色
Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.

77
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,940
人家是化在嘴里的焦糖色啦
I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.

78
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,730
天啊
Oh, man.

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,030
瞧我的鼻子
Look at my nose.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,510
或许是送错货了
Maybe it's a shipping problem.

81
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,740
-什么  -对啊
- What? - Yeah.

82
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,300
或许韦斯利·斯奈普斯和大嘴鸟山姆
Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam
韦斯利·斯奈普斯  美国黑人男星
大嘴鸟山姆  果脆圈的代表卡通形象

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,810
刚收到跟你们俩长得一模一样的模型人偶
just got action figures that look like you guys.

84
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,190
难看死了
This sucks.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,870
真不敢相信老子花了那么多钱
I can't believe I wasted all that money.

86
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,070
可惜我女朋友不让我买啊
Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one.

87
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,520
快看我的表情
Look at my face.

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,660
是不是洋洋得意  我觉得是哦
Do I look smug? I feel smug.

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,680
我恨你让我留下看完片尾的演职员名单
I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,590
有时候电影会在片尾藏有彩蛋啊
Well, sometimes there's a secret ending,

91
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,210
好比《复仇者联盟》
like in The Avengers.

92
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,820
好吧  但我不觉得犹太大屠杀的纪录片
Yeah, but I don't think that's going to happen

93
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,510
会在片尾有什么彩蛋啊
in a documentary about the Holocaust.

94
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,850
可以播点穿帮镜头啊
They could show bloopers.

95
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,210
不要啊
Oh, no.

96
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,760
那是什么声音
What is that?

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,470
那是谢尔顿的
That is Sheldon's

98
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,330
"老子不爽  老子要毁了地球"之音
"I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet" music.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,870
走吧  我们去你家
Come on, let's just go to your place.

100
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,990
别走啊  他不开心  我们不该开导下他吗
Well, wait, if he's unhappy, shouldn't we talk to him?

101
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,130
"我们不该开导下他吗"
"Shouldn't we talk to him?"

102
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,360
你这六年来毛都没学到吗
Have you learned nothing in six years?

103
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,200
你还好吗  亲爱的
You doing okay, sweetie?

104
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,260
这是不祥的背景音乐
There is ominous music playing,

105
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,690
我还像阿富汗人戴头巾
and there is an afghan over my head.

106
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,620
我不知道你打哪儿来的
I don't know where you're from,

107
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,220
但在我老家那边  这代表我很不好
but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.

108
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,550
要不要我给你弄杯茶
Want me to make you some tea?

109
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,940
茶是我不开心时喝的  我又没不开心
Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset.

110
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,740
学校逼我得跟克莱皮克合作
The university's forcing me to work with Kripke.

111
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,280
我现在是气炸了
I'm outraged.

112
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,880
那是泡热可可吗
So, cocoa?

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
废话  当然是可可
Yes, cocoa.

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,630
你们知道那种被迫跟某些
Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired

115
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,000
超惹人厌家伙共处的感觉吗
with someone who's so incredibly annoying?

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,170
老师  问我  我知道
Oh, teacher! Me! Me!

117
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,490
我那些超棒的成果
See, I did all this great work,

118
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,430
现在要让他横插一脚  然后毁掉它
and now he's just going to come along and ruin it.

119
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,440
这是我这辈子最气最绝望的时刻了
I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.

120
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,080
这种时候该泡啥给你喝呢
What beverage do you make for that?

121
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,550
等等  等等  我知道的
Oh... no, no, no, I know this.

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
热苹果汁加肉桂条吗
Hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?

123
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,350
废话  当然是热苹果汁加肉桂条啦
Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!

124
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,710
你搞毛啊  库伯
What the frig, Cooper?

125
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,670
我们不是约好半小时前我办公室见吗
We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.

126
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,240
但现在是你上我办公室来了
And yet, now you're in my office.

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,340
库伯  得一分
Point, Cooper.

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,760
欢迎来到竞技场啊  克莱皮克
Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.

129
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,350
我们说好要交换各自的研究
We agreed to exchange copies of our work.

130
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,670
让我看你的
Let me see yours.

131
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,060
你怎么不让我先看你的
Why don't you show me yours first.

132
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,400
你当我第一天出社会啊
You think I just fell off the turnip truck?

133
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,520
我们同时交换
We exchange at the same time.

134
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,470
我怎么知道你不会拿走我的杰作
How do I know you're not going to take my ideas

135
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,050
然后以自己的名义发表呢
and publish them as your own?

136
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,720
那我怎么你不会对我用这招呢
How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
因为我没兴趣让自己的名字
Yeah, because I'm not interested

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,670
出现在某本疯子杂志上
in getting published in Mad magazine.

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
竞技场里唇枪舌剑很猛烈  脑子要跟上
Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.

140
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,710
到底要不要互换啊
Are we going to do this or not?

141
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,630
谢谢
Thank you.

142
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,980
我们看一遍对方的研究  明天再碰面吧
So, we read each other's work, meet again tomorrow?

143
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,360
行
Fine.

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,190
想蒙我啊  这是白纸
Nice try. This is blank paper.

145
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,880
我肯定那也比这里面的内容
And I am sure it's still more valuable

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,500
还来得有价值
than whatever's in here.

147
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,050
老实交出来  库伯
Cough it up, Cooper.

148
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,390
好吧
Very well.

149
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,820
这里面要再是白纸  老子一定暴怒
If this one's blank, too, I'm going to be furious.

150
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,030
好啦
Fine.

151
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,060
你
You!

152
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,220
永远要信黑
Always bet on black.
有赌轮盘时  永远下注选黑色  以及信黑人的意思

153
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,030
把那坑钱货从我面前移开
Get that waste of money out of my face.

154
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,440
这玩偶不坑啊
It's only a waste of money

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,450
我们不玩才被坑呢
if we don't play with them.

156
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,140
他说的对  兄弟[黑人腔]
He's right, dawg.

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,930
别闹了  我在干活
Please, I'm working.

158
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,880
其实还有一个方法  能弄到跟本人一样的
You know, there is a way we can get action figures

159
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
模型人偶呢
to look exactly like us.

160
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,140
是吗  说来听听
Oh, yeah? How's that?

161
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,890
两个词  3-D打印机
Two words: 3-D printer.

162
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,440
等等  可能算三个词
Wait, maybe it's three words.

163
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
不  让我想想
No, hang on.

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,030
好吧  一个词  一个字母  一个数字  以及
Okay, one word, a letter and a number and...

165
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,600
一个连字号吧
maybe a hyphen.

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,740
3-D打印机
3-D printer.

167
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,150
我的确想要台3-D打印机很久了
I have always wanted a 3-D printer.

168
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,470
你当然想要啦
Of course you have.

169
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,600
那可是工程师的梦想
They're an engineer's dream.

170
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,740
只要你设计得出
Anything you can design,

171
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,910
那打印机就能用塑料做出实物
a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.

172
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,320
是啊  可是那个超贵呢
Yeah, but they're so expensive.

173
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
别这样嘛
Oh, come on.

174
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,380
你值得拥有一台
You deserve one.

175
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,880
你费了那么大的劲才找到一个
You've worked hard to find a woman

176
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,180
超会赚钱的老婆
who makes a lot of money.

177
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,790
那玩意价钱也降下来了
Well, the prices have been coming down.

178
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,020
对啊
Oh, true.

179
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,060
他们现在基本就是白送的了
They're practically giving them away.

180
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,090
只要你给够钱  他就送你
You know, in exchange for money.

181
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,760
我们可以用它做出工作需要的东西
And we can make stuff we need for work with it.

182
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,960
我计算机辅助设计与制造的技术原形
Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs,

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,190
特制的工具
specialized tools...

184
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,030
还有马里布高富帅库萨帕里玩偶
Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali

185
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,970
以及他的超屌梦幻豪宅啦
and his totally bitchin' dream house.

186
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,440
我们才没必要做那豪宅呢
We don't need Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.

187
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
是吗  聪明小伙
Really, smart guy?

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,420
那他新买的超帅跑车要停哪里啊
Where's he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?

189
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,670
我烟草实验的猴子已经开始抽烟斗了
The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe.

190
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,000
按理我应该这时取出他的脑子检验
I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine,

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,270
但我做不到  他这样子让我想起我叔叔
but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle.

192
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,690
你今晚安静得出奇啊
You've been awfully quiet tonight.

193
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,030
你没事吧
Is everything okay?

194
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,260
我没事
I'm fine.

195
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,000
好吧  那今天工作如何了
All right, well, how was work today?

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,740
你跟克莱皮克交换研究报告了吗
Did you exchange your research with Kripke?

197
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,340
交换了
Yes.

198
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,420
谢尔顿  到底怎么啦
Sheldon, what's going on?

199
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,260
我读了他的研究...
I read his research, and...

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,830
他的成果超过我好几百条街
it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.

201
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,010
这也意味着  学校里第一聪明的物理学家
Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist

202
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,010
原来不是我的妈的儿子
at the university is not my mommy as I had thought.

203
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,780
而是他妈的儿子
It's his mommy.

204
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,540
谢尔顿  真希望能为你做点什么
Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do

205
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,380
让你开心点的事情
to make you feel better.

206
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,760
我能给你个安慰拥抱吗
May I offer you a consoling hug?

207
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,470
我都没东西能损失了  当然行
What do we have to lose?

208
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,800
感觉如何
How's that?

209
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,120
感觉像是被大蟒蛇勒住了
I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor.

210
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,220
谁让你松手的
Why'd you stop?

211
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,600
谢尔顿  快点  要迟到了
Come on, Sheldon! We're going to be late!

212
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,990
我今天去不了  我生病了
I can't go in today. I'm sick.

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,600
你才没生病
You're not sick.

214
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,870
你只是不想面对克莱皮克
You just don't want to face Kripke.

215
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,200
是真的  你看
No, look.

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,430
128华氏度[约53.3摄氏度]
128.

217
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,120
你看吧
See?

218
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
你把这玩意浸茶里了吗
What did you do, put this in your tea?

219
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,580
不是吧
Oh, dear.

220
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,140
现在我笨得连你都蒙不了了
Now I'm not even smarter than you.

221
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,450
谢尔顿  你不是比克莱皮克笨啦
Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you.

222
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,190
你只是思路错了
You just got stuck on a wrong path.

223
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,560
爱因斯坦也这样过啊
Happened to Einstein.

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,690
他被统一场论困扰了好几十年
He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.

225
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,820
别跟我说什么爱因斯坦
Oh, don't play the Einstein card.

226
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,050
他成功的前提是  当时的所有人毛都不懂
His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything.

227
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,330
所以发现什么都能算是大突破
So everything was a great breakthrough.

228
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,040
谢尔顿·李·库珀
Sheldon Lee Cooper,

229
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,920
我没时间听你胡扯
I do not have time for this nonsense.

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,780
现在赶紧给我穿衣服  上车
Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car,

231
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,370
跟我上班去
and lets go to work.

232
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,390
别激动啊  仁兄
All right, geez.

233
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
瞧你这小爆脾气
What a grouch.

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,640
我是怎么做到的
How did I do that?

235
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,360
我得记住刚才是怎么做到的
I got to remember how I did that.

236
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,940
你有没有意识到  拥有这台3-D打印机
Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer,

237
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,800
我们就能夺回生产过程
we are reclaiming the manufacturing process

238
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,180
并抢回中国血汗工厂工人的工作
and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?

239
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,770
这玩意本身就是中国制造的
I think this thing was made in China.

240
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,160
那我们也没办法了
Eh, what can you do?

241
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,880
完成了
Ooh, I-I think it's done.

242
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,510
成功了
It worked!

243
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,050
我们造了个哨子
We printed a whistle.

244
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,070
酷毙了
Amazing.

245
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,040
你知道这东西在派对用品店里
You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop

246
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,120
一个卖25美分吧
at a party store.

247
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,870
而且仅用三小时就做好了
And we made it in only three hours.

248
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,050
声音和店里卖的一模一样
Sounds just like store-bought.

249
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,570
你摆个超级英雄的姿势
Okay, give me a superhero pose,

250
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,850
我把你扫描到电脑
and I will scan you into the computer

251
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,780
好做出你的模型人偶
for your action figure.

252
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,200
要是我身材好点就好了
Oh, I wish I was in better shape.

253
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,550
别收腹了
Stop holding your stomach in.

254
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,350
我会用电脑给你安上六块诱人腹肌
I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.

255
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,080
好的  太好了
Oh, okay, great.

256
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,420
我能有瓦尔·基尔默在《蝙蝠侠》中的身材
Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman
蝙蝠侠扮演者

257
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,060
而不用是他现在这身材
instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.

258
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,640
你还是稍微收一下腹吧
All right, you can suck it in a little bit.

259
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,300
库珀  我们得聊聊
Cooper, we have a problem.

260
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,240
你的研究可真是没
Your work is really not

261
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,580
达到我原以为的水准啊
at a level I expected it to be.

262
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,020
我知道
I know.

263
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,880
尽情嘲笑我吧
Go ahead, mock me.

264
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,570
用点简单的词  免得我听不懂
Just use small words so I understand.

265
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,480
别跟我装傻
Don't play dumb with me.

266
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,170
你我都知道你的问题在哪里
We both know what your problem is.

267
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,080
是吗
We do?

268
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,620
你有个女朋友
You have a girlfriend.

269
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,800
所以呢
So?

270
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,720
换我的话  专业水平也会降低
So my work would suffer, too,

271
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,700
谁叫你每天巫山云雨乐不思蜀呢
if I was getting laid all the time.

272
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,870
没错
Yes.

273
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,810
就是因为这个
That is the reason.

274
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,580
我的专业水准降低  就是因为
My work is suffering because of...

275
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,450
巫山云雨乐不思蜀
all the laid I'm getting.

276
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,010
你这个走运的混蛋
You lucky bastard.

277
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,150
我能说什么呢
What can I say, you know?

278
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,380
她很享受我的生殖器
She enjoys my genitals.

279
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,680
我每天晚上都让她欲仙欲死
I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.

280
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,680
少显摆了
Okay, stop bragging.

281
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,980
你有一些很棒的见解
You had some brilliant insights in here,

282
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,010
但如果我们要成功的话
but if we're gonna make this work,

283
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,250
你得集中注意力  多加努力才行
you need to buckle down and focus.

284
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,560
我会尽力而为的
I'll do what I can.

285
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,210
但这并非易事
But it's not going to be easy,

286
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,200
因为我和艾米在一起时
because when I'm with Amy

287
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,520
我们的关键部位磨磨蹭蹭...
and our bathing suit areas mush together...

288
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,390
真是让人无法自拔啊
is it boy howdy, is it magic.

289
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,290
真好  你回来了
Oh, good, you're home.

290
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,000
我给你准备了小惊喜
Got a little surprise for you.

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,970
是什么
What?

292
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,500
和我这位小朋友打个招呼吧
Say hello to my little friend.

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

294
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,560
真是太可爱了
That's so cute.

295
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,230
我真没想到还能有更小版的你啊
I didn't think there could be a smaller version of you.

296
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,320
是吧是吧
I know, right?

297
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,200
多亏有照片
And, thanks to photographs

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,990
还有3D塑造工艺
and some little 3-D modeling,

299
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,800
新娘驾到咯
here comes the bride.

300
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,930
华仔  我好喜欢啊
Oh, Howie, I love these.

301
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,090
我就知道你会的
I thought you might.

302
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,150
这东西贵吗
Were they expensive?

303
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,130
一分钱没花  我自己做的
Didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.

304
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,890
-怎么做的  -库萨帕里和我
- How? - Koothrappali and I

305
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,710
花五千块买了个二手3-D打印机
bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.

306
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,150
五千块买了几个娃娃
$5,000 for a couple of dolls?

307
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,000
你吃错药了吗
Are you out of your mind?

308
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,460
这可不是几个娃娃
Not just a couple of dolls.

309
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,180
我们想要多少  就能做多少
For as many dolls as we want.

310
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,140
还能做哨子呢
And whistles.

311
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,920
你这样花钱如流水的时候
At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me

312
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,280
有想过要跟我通报一声吗
about spending this kind of money?

313
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,000
现在想到了
It's kind of dawning on me now.

314
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,920
简直难以置信
I don't believe you!

315
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,110
华仔  我们没钱买这样的垃圾
Howie, we can't afford to waste money on junk like this.

316
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,760
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

317
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,490
我们挣了那么多的钱
We make plenty of money.

318
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,670
我挣了很多钱
I make plenty of money!

319
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,530
你赚得塞牙缝都不够
You make peanuts!

320
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,530
是的  但现在我们是夫妻了
Yes, but we're married now.

321
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,520
这意味着  你生病时
That means, when you get sick,

322
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,310
我会照顾你
I take care of you.

323
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,300
你挣很多钱时
And when you make a bunch of money,

324
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,650
我可以买东西
I get to buy stuff.

325
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,820
你不喜欢也没办法
Sorry if you don't like it,

326
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,070
爱情就是这样
but that's how love works.

327
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,390
不  爱情是这样
No, here's how love works.

328
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,930
要么你退回机器
You're gonna return the machine,

329
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,890
要么你就打印出一套女性私密部位
or you can print out a working set of lady parts

330
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,780
跟那"睡"去吧
and sleep with those.

331
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,320
我的天  你居然还真想啊
Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?

332
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,030
好吧  我不太明白
All right, I don't understand.

333
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,210
你为什么不跟克莱皮克说实话
Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?

334
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,520
说实话会让我很没面子
Because the truth made me look bad,

335
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,640
相反  荒谬又无耻的谎言令我面上有光
whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good.

336
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,580
总之  如果克莱皮克问起
Anyway, if Kripke asks,

337
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,340
跟他说  我与艾米的行房是频繁的
tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent,

338
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,510
激烈的   创造力十足的
intense and whimsically inventive.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,480
我行房时有创造力十足吗
Is my coitus whimsically inventive?

340
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,280
我在公共厕所的墙上就是这样写的
That is what I write on the bathroom walls.

341
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,950
要寻找创造力十足的一夜激情
"For a whimsically inventive time,

342
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,660
请致电莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
call Leonard Hofstadter."

343
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,090
我知道你在开玩笑  不过我不介意啦
I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.

344
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,860
-谢尔顿  问你个问题好吗  -请便
- Sheldon, can I ask you a question? - Of course.

345
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,300
你会跟艾米上床吗
You ever going to sleep with Amy?

346
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,100
这是相当私人的问题
That's awfully personal.

347
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
我们不问谢尔顿这样的问题
We don't ask Sheldon things like that.

348
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,840
也许你不能问  我能
Maybe you don't; I do.

349
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,010
到底怎么回事
What's the deal?

350
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,780
现在大学里风传
Well, word around the university

351
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,180
我给予了她的性器官到位的撞击
is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.

352
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,190
得了  说真的
All right, come on, be serious.

353
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,880
你们已经交往很长时间了
Look, you guys have been going out a long time.

354
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,170
很明显她希望
She would clearly like

355
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,090
与你发生性爱关系
to have a physical relationship with you,

356
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,680
你到底在干嘛
so what are you doing?

357
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,320
好吧  废话说完了
All right, we're down the rabbit hole.

358
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,960
你到底在干嘛
What are you doing?

359
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,700
首先  我相当喜欢艾米
Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.

360
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,330
那有什么问题
Then what's the problem?

361
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,600
佩妮
Penny...

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,520
我这辈子  其他人觉得
all my life, I have been uncomfortable

363
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,350
轻而易举的身体接触
with the sort of physical contact

364
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,230
我都觉得不自在
that comes easily to others--

365
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,980
握手  拥抱
hand-shaking, hugging,

366
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,710
前列腺检查
prostate exams.

367
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,180
但我在努力改变  知道吗
But I'm working on it, you know?

368
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,290
最近  我还给艾米的胸口擦了感冒止咳膏呢
Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest.

369
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,090
一年前  这是无法想像的事
A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.

370
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,630
现在你明白了  我被迫给你擦时是什么滋味
Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.

371
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,900
好了  等等
Okay. Hang on.

372
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,800
你是说有一天  你与艾米
Are you saying someday you and Amy might...

373
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,000
会有亲密接触吗
actually get physical?

374
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,950
有这个可能性
It's a possibility.

375
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,180
我的天
Oh, my God!

376
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,590
谢尔顿  我知道对你来说不容易
Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you,

377
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,470
我真的很高兴你愿意聊这个话题
and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.

378
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,580
别客气
Oh, yeah.

379
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,400
你确定要这样做吗
Are you sure you want to do this?

380
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,790
放弃3-D打印机的一半所有权
Give up your half of the 3-D printer?

381
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,830
是的
Yes.

382
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,980
麻烦你写上伯纳黛特的名字
And can you please make that out to Bernadette?

383
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,880
我从联名账户中除名了
I was taken off the joint account

384
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,500
等我了解金钱的价值后才能回归
until I learn the value of money.

385
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,190
太残忍了
Wow, that's harsh.

386
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,750
还用说吗
Tell me about it.

387
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,310
你不吃午餐吗
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

388
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,760
我的饭钱都花在口袋妖怪卡上了
Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.

389
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,210
等式两端相等
Well, the equation balances,

390
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,160
但是算法不够简洁
but it's certainly not elegant.

391
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,370
无所谓  昨晚你又爽了吧
Whatever. You get any last night?

392
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,930
是的
Yes.

393
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,790
给了她猛烈地一发咩
Gave it to her good, huh?

394
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,930
不  是给了她升天的一发
No, I gave it to her well.

395
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,230
好了  这里  我在想
Now, over here, I was thinking

396
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,300
湍流可以减少  只要我们...
the turbulence could be reduced if we just put...

397
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,910
随便啦
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,550
她是一丝不挂  还是穿着内衣半遮半掩
Was she naked, or was she wearing lingerie?

399
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,920
我没注意
I didn't notice.

400
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,560
你怎么会没注意
How could you not notice?

401
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,290
我忙于
I was too busy

402
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,720
挤压她身体的所有欲望部位
squishing all the desirable parts of her body.

403
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,560
我听得好嗨啊  库珀
Ah, you're killing me, Cooper!

404
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,230
可以继续谈工作吗
Can we get back to work?

405
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,810
当然  当然
Sure, sure, sure.

406
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,900
你们有用过玩具吗[性用具]
You guys ever use any toys?

407
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,970
玩具
Toys?

408
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,890
我床边放着一个火箭模型
I do have a model rocket next to my bed.

409
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,020
火箭  你个死变态
A rocket? You're a freak!

410
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,590
太合我胃口了
I love it!
