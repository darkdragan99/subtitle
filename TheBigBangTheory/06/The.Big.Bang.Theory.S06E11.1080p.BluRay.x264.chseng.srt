1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,790
抓住壁炉两侧  固定好位置
Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,510
将壁炉台组合至壁炉上方
lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,440
你看  我靠着自己这双手造了个壁炉呢
Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,690
你好龙精虎猛哦
You're so butch.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,550
哎哟  被纸割伤手了
Aw, I got a little paper cut.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,780
完全不意外
Of course you did.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,030
你的芊芊玉手比小牛肉还嫩呢
Your hands are softer than veal.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
趁我没忘  提醒你一下  这周六
Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,650
桌上角色扮演游戏
我约了大家玩《龙与地下城》哦
Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,070
真的吗  周六晚你就打算这么庆祝啊
Really? That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,300
别这样  我几乎都没什么机会玩了
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,410
你个可怜的娃
Oh, you poor thing.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,560
有个真实存在还能滚床单的女朋友
Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,970
碍着你跟你心爱的小桌游嬉戏了吗
getting in the way of your board games?

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,910
是有一点啦
Little bit, yeah.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,090
好耶  我一直都想玩玩看《龙与地下城》呢
Oh, great! I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,630
抱歉  是我不好
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,360
我应该先说在前头
I should've mentioned this earlier.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
你未被邀请
You're not invited.

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,990
为什么没有啊
Why not?

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,550
艾米  每隔一段时间
Amy, from time to time,

22
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,930
我们男人都需要挣脱文明礼仪的束缚
we men need to break free from the shackles of civility

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,860
并回归原始野性的自我
and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,240
就掷掷骰子
By rolling dice

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,660
然后用小人偶玩幻想游戏也算啊
and playing make-believe with little figurines?

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,910
是啊  又野蛮又粗暴啊
Yeah, like a bunch of savages.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,290
周六晚啊
Saturday night?

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,750
我这周天天都加班
But I've been working late all week.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
还想着那晚能是二人时光呢
That was gonna be our night.

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,220
我不去不行啊
But I have to go.

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,540
我们大家要一起玩啊
We play as a group.

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,560
要是我去不成  其他人会说你坏话的
If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,980
他们就会说  "伯纳黛特超扫兴
They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined everything.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,130
她个臭八婆"
She's the worst."

35
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,450
你理解吗
So, you see?

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,850
我不能不去玩《龙与地下城》啊
I have to play Dungeons and Dragons...

37
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,990
是为我们婚姻着想
for the marriage.

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,520
你个死白痴
You're an idiot.

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,070
是你的小白痴
I'm your idiot.

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,010
死都甩不掉哦
Forever.

41
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,890
听我说  我们之前的确是说了
So, listen, I know we talked about

42
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,010
要去银湖吃吃东西
getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake,

43
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,360
然后去格里菲斯公园看看圣诞灯饰
and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park,

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,370
可莱纳德找我们去他家玩《龙与地下城》呢
but Leonard's talking about a big D and D game at his place.

45
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,410
周六夜要从嗨翻升级成史诗级啦
Saturday night just went from crazy to epic!

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,790
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十一集

47
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,180
谢尔顿  要想开始征途
All right, Sheldon, to start our quest,

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,770
你必须先打开我送你的这圣诞礼物
you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,590
圣诞礼物啊
A Christmas gift?

50
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,920
你明知道我不爱圣诞节
You know I don't enjoy Christmas.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,270
圣诞节有什么不好啊
What's wrong with Christmas?

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,510
太多缺点  不知从何开始
Oh, where to begin?

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,970
室内摆树
Trees indoors.

54
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,180
猛拽古文  例如"此乃"圣诞佳节
Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas."

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,920
还有这荒谬的单脚袜习俗
And the absurd custom of one stocking.

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,550
是人都知道  袜子就该成双成对
Everyone knows socks belong in pairs.

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,480
谁会要单脚袜啊
Who uses one sock?

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,680
一只脚是木制假腿的海盗吧
Pirate with a peg leg?

59
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,750
有用处我就舒服多了  谢啦
Actually that helps, thank you.

60
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,720
就赶紧看里面有啥嘛
Would you just look inside?

61
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,330
是个卷轴
Oh, a scroll.

62
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,720
我最爱卷轴了
I like scrolls.

63
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,420
卷轴是我第三喜爱的
They're my third favorite system of

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,550
文字传输方式
transmitting the written word.

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,220
仅在石碑与飞机空中文字之后
After stone tablets and skywriting.

66
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,440
"在座各位皆是被召唤来参与
"You have all been summoned to join

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,940
紧张刺激的《龙与地下城》冒险的人选
a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure.

68
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,120
你们踏上征途的起因
Your quest begins in

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,580
是由于一个神秘的北方小精灵村庄
a secret northern village of elves

70
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,370
被人血洗屠村"
who have all been massacred."

71
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,390
这故事走向我喜欢
I like where this is heading.

72
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,080
"你们的任务是要营救
"Your task is to rescue their leader

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,770
被困于食人魔地下城的村长"
from a dungeon of ogres."

74
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,980
好妙的故事转折啊
Oh, that's a saucy twist.

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,430
"而村长的名字是...
"That leader's name:

76
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,440
圣诞老人"
Santa Claus""

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,330
不  不  不啊
No, no, no!

78
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,380
圣诞老人是"呵  呵  呵"的笑
It's actually, "Ho, ho, ho,"

79
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,300
你再多练练就会了
but you'll get the hang of it.

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,210
我觉得把节日混合入任务里
Thought it'd be fun to make

81
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,650
会很有意思嘛
a quest with a holiday theme.

82
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,620
有意思吗
Fun?

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
把《龙与地下城》跟圣诞节混合起来
Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,090
就像是做三明治  把最好吃的果冻
like making a sandwich of grape jelly,

85
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,400
葡萄果冻
the best-tasting jelly,

86
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,020
跟最难吃的果冻  石化制果冻混一起
and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.

87
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,940
石化制胶状物  直译石化制果冻  也就是凡士林]

88
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,290
好了  开始啦
Okay, here we go.

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,690
"你们发现自己
"You find yourselves

90
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,890
身处于圣诞村烟雾弥漫的废墟之中
in the smoking remains of Santa's village.

91
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,570
显然  此地刚发生过一场大战"
Clearly, a great battle has taken place."

92
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,110
好兴奋啊  第一个怪物露头
Oh, man, the first monster I see,

93
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,450
我要潜到他背后  掏出我的小魔棒
I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand,

94
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,240
用我的魔法射满他菊花
and shoot my magic all over his ass.

95
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,580
你说出这些话时  自己有听到吗
Do you hear yourself when you say these things?

96
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,930
在雪地上发现了食人魔足印
Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of

97
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,480
还有用拐杖糖碎块留下的路线线索
broken candy canes in the snow.

98
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,540
谢尔顿  你采取什么行动
Sheldon, what do you do?

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,430
我选择这你残酷  没人性
I signal my contempt for your cruel plan

100
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,430
硬逼我庆祝圣诞节计划
to shove Christmas joy down my throat

101
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,970
以"你们瞧这二货"的言语来加以鄙视
by making a gesture that says, "get a load of this guy."

102
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,850
行  霍华德  你采取什么行动
Fine. Howard, what do you do?

103
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,380
我选择跟随食人魔足印
I follow the ogre tracks,

104
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,480
并在跟踪时  检查路上有无暗门密道
checking for secret doors along the way.

105
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,810
你发现了一个门后是阴暗走廊的暗门
And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.

106
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,150
兄弟们  先布置好计划
Okay, guys, let's make a plan:

107
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,040
战士走前排  法师站后排
spell casters in the back, warriors in the front...

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,710
少废话  老子要杀进去了
No, screw that noise, I'm going in.

109
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,540
圣诞老人  撑着点  我来救你了
Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you!

110
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,520
你跑进了一件兵器房里
Okay, you run into a room full of weapons,

111
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,100
触发了陷阱
hit a trip wire...

112
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,400
一门大炮炸飞了你的头  角色死亡  你出局了
...a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.

113
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,690
等等  一门大炮啊
But... a canon?

114
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,660
我真的出局了吗
Am I really out of the game?

115
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,650
你真幸运
Lucky.

116
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
好了  游戏继续进行
Okay, come on, moving on.

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,780
等等  你们身上都没有复活之棒吗
Wait, doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection?

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,870
你们谁有  我急需这跟小棒棒啊
Because if you've got one, I need it bad.

119
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,970
赶紧掏出你的棒棒  给人家来一棒嘛
Get in here with your rod and give it to me.

120
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,400
好吧  你说话之前
Okay, you need to say these things

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,900
得把原话在脑子里好好过一遍
in your head before you say them out loud.

122
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,960
伙计们
Hey, guys.

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,380
我不是故意打断你们的小游戏
I don't mean to interrupt your little game,

124
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,600
但我觉得你们会想知道  自己都错过了啥
but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on.

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,710
那么...
So...

126
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,660
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?

127
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,430
伯纳黛特脚踩豹纹高跟鞋
Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps

128
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,210
身穿爆乳红裙  均购自"永远21"
and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21.

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,220
接下来是艾米
And there's Amy,

130
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,490
与她的露"脚踝"装
showing all kinds of ankle.

131
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,110
身上那件衣服  我估计是购自"永远63"吧
In an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63.

132
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,630
而我自己呢...
And I, myself...

133
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,740
穿着一条小码紧身裙  我可是靠它
...am wearing a little number that got me

134
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,820
免了两张超速罚单和陪审员的义务
out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.

135
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,410
我知道她们是用夸张手法来表达某事
I know they're making a rhetorical point,

136
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,520
可我真看不出是说什么事
I just don't know what it is.

137
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,380
再见  伙计们  我们要去喝酒啦
See you, boys. We are going drinking.

138
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,560
等等  我能跟你们一起去吗
Uh, wait, can I come with you?

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,600
我玩的角色死了
My character died.

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,670
抱歉  拉杰  今晚是闺蜜之夜
Sorry, Raj, it's girls' night out.

141
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,420
或许下次吧
Maybe another time.

142
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,730
好吧
Okay...

143
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,500
走吧
Come on.

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,980
闺蜜之夜  闺蜜之夜
Girls' night, girls' night!

145
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,210
他怎么会听不到自己说这种话呢
How does he not hear that?

146
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,880
有什么大计
So, what's the plan?

147
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,430
我们要不要给各自的男友一点教训
Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson

148
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,850
喝个酩酊大醉
by getting stinking drunk,

149
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,500
勾引陌生男人到厕所
luring strange men into the bathroom,

150
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,790
把厕所隔间变成性爱感官神殿
and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
-不要  -当然不
- No! - No!

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,280
天啊  现在谁才是"永远63"啊
Geez, who's Forever 63 now?

153
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,240
能给我们桌再来一瓶香槟吗
Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table?

154
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,070
别担心
Don't worry.

155
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,330
我请客
It's my treat.

156
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,370
谢谢
Thanks.

157
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,110
你应该多来参加我们的闺蜜之夜
You should come to girls' night more often.

158
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,480
绝不是因为如果你不在
And not just because if you weren't here,

159
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
我们就要从喝香槟沦落为喝啤酒哦
this would be a can of Pabst.

160
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,770
这是我的荣幸  能有机会宠溺女人
My pleasure; nothing makes me happier

161
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,430
比任何事都让我开心
than the chance to spoil a lady.

162
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,800
不信问问我的狗
Just ask my dog.

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,830
兽医说如果我再喂她鹅肝酱
My vet says if I give her any more foie gras,

164
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,300
她就要死于痛风了
she's going to die of gout.
常吃动物类内脏会导致尿酸高  从而引起痛风

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,500
我们今晚帮拉杰找个姑娘吧
Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,820
别了别了  我无所谓
No, no, no, I'm fine.

167
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,430
慢着  我们说的是找个姑娘搞一夜情
Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand

168
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,530
还是找个姑娘谈恋爱呀
or do we want to get him into a relationship?

169
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,620
找个姑娘把床上
Let's get him laid!

170
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,490
别这样  闺蜜之夜  主角是闺蜜
Stop it. You're ruining girls' night.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,190
拉杰  你是个好男人
Raj, you're a great guy,

172
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,780
而且这酒吧全是单身女人  让我们帮你吧
you're in a bar full of single women; let us help you.

173
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,060
对啊  你真的是个好对象
Yeah, you're a real catch.

174
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,710
我知道你害羞  但这并不意味着
I know you're shy, but that doesn't mean

175
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,500
你生命中不应拥有一位佳人
you shouldn't have someone wonderful in your life.

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,830
你们真好心
That's sweet of you.

177
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,120
但你们能怎么帮我呢
But what can you do to help?

178
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,470
我们四周打探一下
We'll nose around,

179
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,060
看看能不能找到一个不错的姑娘  然后介绍你认识
see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.

180
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,210
好吧
Okay.

181
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,040
有几点要注意
Well, a couple of things.

182
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,200
别告诉她们我出身富庶
Don't tell them I come from money.

183
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,660
我要她们爱我  而不是爱我的钱
I want them to love me for me.

184
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,990
她们一定要超级性感
They must be insanely hot.

185
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,000
身材样貌起码得有9分或10分
Like, nines or tens.

186
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,070
9分或10分吗
Nines or tens?

187
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,470
好吧  8分也可以接受
Okay, an eight is acceptable

188
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,160
前提是她会带另外一个8分女来跟我三人泡澡
if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.

189
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,440
反正  我们找着啥样的你都会要  对吧
Bottom line: you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?

190
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,210
果断会要
In a New Delhi minute.

191
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,360
我不记得你在我店里买过这些小模型啊
I don't remember you buying these miniatures in my store.

192
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
是没买过
Oh, uh, yeah.

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,530
这是在亚马逊上买的
I got 'em on Amazon.

194
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,000
当然  我懂的
Sure. I get it.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,940
与其扶持一个朋友
Why support a friend

196
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,970
为何不去扶持一家把你朋友的生活
when you can support a multinational conglomerate

197
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,140
挤压得穷苦潦倒的跨国大企业呢
that is crushing the life out of that friend?

198
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,910
我知道  但当我上网购物时
I know, but when I shop online,

199
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,720
我可以边上厕所边买
I can do it on the toilet.

200
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,600
你见过我的店吗
Have you seen my store?

201
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,580
那个地方跟厕所没两样
The whole place is a toilet.

202
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,460
能继续进行游戏了吗
C-Can we please move this along?

203
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,270
可以  抱歉
Yeah, sorry.

204
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,930
你们走到了的尽头
Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel

205
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,680
发现了一个大宝箱[大胸]
and find a large chest.

206
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,260
你将采取什么行动
What do you do?

207
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,730
对了  霍华德  拜托不要说
And, Howard, do not say,

208
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,140
"我要上去抓一把"
"I feel up the large chest."

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,350
不好意思  我现在可是已婚男人
Excuse me, I'm a married man now.

210
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,690
我才不会说这么幼稚的话呢
I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.

211
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,520
很好  那你会怎么做
Great. What do you do?

212
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,420
我会走到那个大胸[大宝箱]前
I walk up to the large chest,

213
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,350
把我的脸埋进去  然后这样玩
bury my face in it and go.

214
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,740
-我选择打开宝箱  -锁着呢
- I open the chest. - It's locked,

215
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,350
但你身后的门突然砰一声关上
but suddenly the door behind you slams shut

216
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,070
现在房间两侧的墙壁开始往中间逼近
and now the walls of the room start closing in.

217
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,790
这下惨了
That's not good.

218
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,640
我和我的角色都有幽闭恐惧症
My character and I both have claustrophobia.

219
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,540
宝箱上出现发光的字  上面写着
Glowing letters appear on the chest that read,

220
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,050
"如果你不想被夹死
"If squashed to death you wish not to be,

221
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,570
那就高歌圣威特·瓦茨拉夫和他的胜利"
sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."

222
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,770
-谁是圣威特·瓦茨拉夫  -墙越来越近了
- Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav? - Walls are getting closer.

223
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,660
我得赶紧想着开心的地方
Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
通常有病的人要靠想着开心的地方转移注意力

224
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,210
等等  圣威特·瓦茨拉夫是波西米亚的君主
Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.

225
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,840
你还有十秒钟就要被夹成肉酱了
You're ten seconds away from getting crushed!

226
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,950
九  八...
Nine, eight...

227
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,830
我们该怎么办
What are we supposed to do?

228
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,370
-七  六  -等下  等下
- ...seven, six... - Wait, wait.

229
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,450
圣威特·瓦茨拉夫就是受人喜爱的
Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas

230
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,260
维多利亚时代圣诞颂歌里的仁君温瑟拉
from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.

231
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,750
从来没听说过
Never heard of it.

232
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,540
肯定就那首圣诞颂歌不是犹太人写的
Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.

233
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,090
三  二...
...three, two...

234
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,640
快唱那首该死的颂歌
Somebody sing the damn song!

235
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,300
* 是日圣徒节 *
* Good King Wenceslas looked out *

236
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,110
* 贤君帘外望 *
* On the feast of Stephen *

237
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,800
* 积雪覆大地 *
* When the snow lay 'round about *

238
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,990
* 松脆且平旷 *
* Deep and crisp and even *

239
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,330
墙越来越近啦
The walls are getting slower.

240
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,250
* 是夜月皎皎 *
* Brightly shone the moon that night *

241
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,930
* 寒霜亦凄凄 *
* Though the frost was cru-el *

242
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,710
* 但见褴褛者 *
* When a poor man came in sight *

243
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,290
* 拾薪不停息 *
* Gath'ring winter fu-el *

244
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,440
墙壁停下了  你们安全了
The walls stop! You're safe!

245
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,190
你可真牛  谢尔顿
That was amazing, Sheldon.

246
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
-你怎么会唱这个  -很简单
- How did you know that? - It was simple.

247
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,180
我将一个关于波西米亚的知名历史事件
I combined a well-known, historical fact

248
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,840
与我对外祖父母的记忆结合在一起
about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents,

249
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,040
那时候外公和外婆  唱着圣诞颂歌
Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols

250
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,250
而我在壁炉前尝试用乐高来制造
while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build

251
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,220
一个高能粒子加速器
a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.

252
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,690
继续我们的任务吧
Okay, continuing our quest.

253
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,460
等一下
W-W-Wait.

254
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,760
还有四段没唱呢
There's still four more verses.

255
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,570
总不能唱个开头没结尾吧
You don't sing a song and not finish it.

256
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,740
* 嗟尔侍者来 *
* Hither, page, and stand by me *

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,310
* 务必据实语 *
* If thou know'st it telling ,*

258
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,080
* 彼处何许人 *
* Yonder peasant, who is he? *

259
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,900
* 此人何所居 *
* Where and what his dwelling? *

260
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,960
* 是夜月皎皎  寒霜亦凄... *
* Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost...*

261
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,530
看来他进展不错啊
It Looks like he's doing pretty good.

262
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,660
那是当然了
Of course he is.

263
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,560
那姑娘刚被男朋友甩了
Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.

264
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
满心愤怒  又醉得烂醉
She's angry, she's drunk,

265
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,400
最爱的电影还是印度电影《贫民窟的百万富翁》
and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean...

266
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,740
必须手到擒来啊
That is some low-hanging fruit.

267
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,610
他回来了
Oh, here he comes.

268
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,410
-怎么样啊  -一切顺利
- So, how'd it go? - Great.

269
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,910
我请她喝了几杯酒
I bought her a couple of drinks,

270
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,780
她就把邮箱地址给我了
and she gave me her E-mail address.

271
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,180
杰妮芙@就算男人死光了只剩你都不要.废柴
"Jennifer@not-even-if-you-were- the-last-guy-on-earth.loser""

272
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,730
什么
What?

273
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,240
真遗憾  拉杰
I'm sorry, Raj.

274
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,330
我怎么就找不到我的佳人呢
Why can't I find someone?

275
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,260
我智商高  工作好
I'm smart, I've got a cool job,

276
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,340
天生古铜的肤色说明
and my naturally bronzed complexion means

277
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,470
别人穿了难看的芥末黄  我也能穿得帅气
I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.

278
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,460
亲爱的  不怪你  是她们脑子有病
Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.

279
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,160
不是的
No, it's not.

280
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,460
她太漂亮了  我高攀不上
She was too beautiful for me.

281
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,040
-你怎么会说这种话  -是真的
- Why would you say that? - It's true.

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,970
我总是迷恋自己得不到的姑娘
I'm always attracted to women I can't have.

283
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,490
我老是这样
I do it all the time.

284
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,730
我以前对你们两个就是啊
I did the same thing with the two of you.

285
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,450
她们两个
The two of them?

286
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,810
我不太明白
I don't understand.

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,570
曾经有段时间我暗恋过佩妮
Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny,

288
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,090
而且当时我以为她也喜欢我
and I thought she was into me, too,

289
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,420
因为有一次她喝醉后脱光
because she got drunk and naked

290
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,680
跟我爬上了床
and climbed into bed with me.

291
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,730
但很显然是我自作多情了
But apparently I misread those signals.

292
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,030
你也喜欢过伯纳黛特啊
And you liked Bernadette also?

293
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,100
那是在佩妮之前
That was before Penny.

294
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,450
我自己定了个规矩  一次只能
I make it a rule to only fall for

295
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,280
爱上一位好朋友的女朋友
one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.

296
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,360
这方面我挺传统的
I'm very old-fashioned that way.

297
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,130
也就是说你曾经
So at, uh, some point,

298
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,330
也喜欢过我了吧
you probably had a thing for me, too.

299
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,840
那倒没有
No, not really.

300
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,060
拜托  拉杰  一点都没有吗
Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?

301
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,260
反正我想不起来这样过
Not that I can think of.

302
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,150
给老娘仔细想
Think harder.

303
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,880
没有
Nope.

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,110
我的心会跟着心的感觉走吧
I guess the heart wants what the heart wants.

305
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,330
而她不是我的菜
Or in this case, doesn't.

306
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,410
完全没兴趣
I mean, at all.

307
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,530
看我干嘛
What?

308
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,740
* 但能济贫士 *
* Ye who now will bless the poor *

309
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,280
* 赐福自返还 *
* Shall yourselves find blessing *

310
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,140
完啦
Done?

311
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,430
你想说的唱完赞叹词应该是"棒啊"
I think the word you're looking for is "bravo."

312
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,350
现在你们离开那个房间  发现自己
Okay, you leave the room and find yourself

313
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,600
来到一个里面有融化的雪人的池子面前
standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

314
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
融化的雪人
Melted snowmen?

315
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,310
水里有雪人五官的胡萝卜和煤块吗
Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?

316
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,920
不知道  有差别吗
I don't know. What's the difference?

317
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,640
这是个幻想游戏  莱纳德
It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.

318
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,520
-给我好好描述画面  -好吧
- Paint a picture. - Fine.

319
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,060
你离开那个房间  发现自己
You leave the room and find yourself

320
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,840
来到一个里面有融化的雪人的池子面前
standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

321
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,760
水里尽是胡萝卜和煤块
There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.

322
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,940
那雪人的大帽子和烟斗上哪了呢
Do we know what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?

323
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,420
你也看见它们在水里了
You see those, too.

324
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,270
真是身临其境呀
Oh, it's like I'm really there.

325
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,940
自从我的治疗师换了我的焦虑症药
I gotta tell you, this-this is the most holiday fun I've had

326
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,110
而且我也再也不在乎我的血便后
since my therapist changed my anxiety medication

327
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,630
我不得不说  这是我最开心的过节了
and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.

328
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,680
好故事
Good story.

329
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,640
你喝什么呢
What are you drinking there?

330
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,830
蛋奶酒吗
Little eggnog?

331
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,760
是的
Yes.

332
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,730
怎么了  不行吗
What, is there a problem?

333
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,140
看你喝圣诞饮品挺好的
No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage.

334
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,370
很有节日氛围
Pretty Christmasy.

335
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,950
蛋奶酒什么时候成圣诞专属了
Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?

336
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,810
一年四季都有鸡蛋生产
Eggs are available all year 'round.

337
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,410
大家都知道我爱在泳池边喝这个
I've been known to enjoy this poolside.

338
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,720
拜托  谢尔顿
Come on, Sheldon.

339
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,330
你知道每一个圣诞故事  和颂歌
You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols,

340
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,360
现在还喝出了个蛋奶酒小胡子
you've got an eggnog mustache going on there.

341
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,650
承认吧
Just admit it.

342
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,250
你挺喜欢圣诞的
You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.

343
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,560
别傻了
Oh, don't be silly.

344
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,650
圣诞节只不过是装饰品工业编出来骗钱的
Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry.

345
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,490
对你来说有什么要紧的啊
Why is this so important to you?

346
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,590
坦白说  因为我小时候的圣诞节都过得很糟
Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid

347
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,880
现在不想你再扫我的兴了
and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.

348
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,580
怎么过得不好了
What was so bad about them?

349
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,430
我家人都是疯子学术家
I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.

350
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,640
我们小孩不给圣诞老人留牛奶和饼干
Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies,

351
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,940
而是得留给他一份研究报告
we had to leave him a research paper.

352
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
而第二天早晨  你会知道圣诞老人来过
And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there

353
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,180
因为你留的报告都评好分了
because the paper would be graded.

354
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,870
怪不得你这么喜欢圣诞节
No wonder you love Christmas.

355
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,960
听起来真是太酷了
That sounds amazing.

356
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,230
一点也不酷
It wasn't amazing.

357
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,050
我曾连续四年得了C-
I got a C-minus four years in a row.

358
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,740
我知道你的水平
Yeah, I'm familiar with your work.

359
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,610
C-都算送了你大礼了
C-minus was your gift.

360
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,980
艾米  真是对不起
Amy, I'm really sorry.

361
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,840
我不是故意让你难过的
I didn't mean to upset you.

362
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,760
没事
It's fine.

363
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,720
我已经习惯被男生无视了
I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice.

364
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,960
直到22岁  我才等到我的初吻
I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22,

365
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,280
那人亲我是因为我拿他的胰岛素要挟
and the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.

366
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,870
有时候  胰腺会跟着胰腺的感觉走
Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.

367
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,670
算了
Forget it.

368
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,650
我没指望你们能明白
I don't expect you guys to understand.

369
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,080
我明白
I understand.

370
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,970
七年级我玩"转瓶子"游戏时
In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle
瓶子指向谁 转的人就去亲对方

371
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,610
瓶子指向了爱林娜·香卡
and it landed on Alina Shankar.

372
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,700
她说如果我敢靠近她
She said if I came near her,

373
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,890
她就敲碎瓶子捅我
she would break the bottle and cut me.

374
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,530
你觉得这样算悲催吗
You think that's bad?

375
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,260
大学时  我在兄弟会派对上喝到不省人事
In college, I passed out at a frat party

376
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,360
醒来时发现衣服没少  反而更多了
and woke up with more clothes on.

377
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,040
有时候我感觉太孤单
Sometimes I get so lonely,

378
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,320
我会坐在左手上直到左手麻木
I sit on my left hand until it goes numb,

379
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,640
然后用右手握住
then I put it in my right hand

380
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,920
假装是别人在握住我的手
and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.

381
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,660
我也会这么做
I do that, too.

382
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,610
有时候左手想伸伸禄山之爪
Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.

383
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,850
我也任它随便摸
And I let it.

384
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,140
能和了解孤单的人聊天
It's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands

385
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,940
感觉真是太好了
what it feels like to be alone.

386
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,460
是吧
It is, isn't it?

387
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,760
但你现在不再孤单了
But you're not alone anymore.

388
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,020
-你有谢尔顿  -是的
- Now you've got Sheldon. - I do.

389
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,330
别担心  终有一天你也会有佳人相伴的
And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.

390
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,540
谢谢
Thank you.

391
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,210
她只要有你一半美丽聪慧  我就心满意足了
I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.

392
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,920
谢谢你  拉杰什
Thank you, Rajesh.

393
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,420
他对我动心了  我满意了  撤
He wants me, I'm good. We can go now.

394
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,550
我靠
Damn it.

395
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,510
怎么了
What?

396
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,750
现在我知道她不喜欢我
Now that I know she doesn't like me,

397
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,530
我好像有点喜欢她了
I'm kind of into her.

398
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,670
好了
All right.

399
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,870
我想我破解了密码  可以放下吊桥了
I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.

400
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,660
太好了  开始吧
Great. Let's do it.

401
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,690
吊桥正在缓缓放下
The drawbridge is lowering.

402
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,530
我的腕管综合症发作了
My carpal tunnel's acting up.

403
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,680
痛也得坚持
Play through the pain!

404
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,230
成功了  吊桥放下了
You did it! The drawbridge is down.

405
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,520
你们跨过峡谷
You cross the chasm

406
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,340
来到一间小小的地牢
and find yourself in a small dungeon room.

407
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,080
在墙角  是被铁链锁住
And in the corner, chained to the wall,

408
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,660
被打到浑身鲜血的圣诞老人
you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.

409
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,110
他说  "呵  呵  救命"
He says, "Ho, ho, help me."

410
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,030
太棒了  我们找到了圣诞老人
Yes, we found Santa!

411
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,030
圣诞节被拯救了
Christmas is saved!

412
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,990
千万别告诉我妈我说过这句话[犹太人不过圣诞]
Don't ever tell my mother I said that.

413
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,400
我取出万能钥匙
I take out my skeleton key

414
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,200
跑向圣诞老人给他解开铁链
and run to Santa to unchain him.

415
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,180
但我抢先向斯图尔特和霍华德施了麻痹咒
But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.

416
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,920
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

417
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,060
你不能说话  你已经被我麻痹了
You can't talk; you're paralyzed.

418
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,790
我来到圣诞老人的大肥脸跟前说
I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say...

419
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,670
瞧瞧瞧
Well, well, well,

420
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,580
乐呵呵的圣诞老头儿  我们又见面了
Jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again.
Jolly Old Saint Nicholas是一首著名的圣诞歌

421
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,070
我相信上次我们聊天
Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke

422
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,140
还是在德州加尔维斯顿市的溪湾商场
was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas,

423
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,390
我当时五岁  对吗
when I was five years old, isn't that right?

424
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,000
好吧
Uh, okay.

425
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,980
我妈硬把我拉去
My mother dragged me there

426
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,590
让我坐在你的大腿上
and she plopped me down on your lap

427
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,160
你问我圣诞节想要什么
and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas.

428
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,300
我告诉你  "我要我的外公"
And I told you "My Pop-Pop,"

429
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,850
因为那年我的外公去世了
because that was the year my grandfather died.

430
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,020
我想他  我想让他死而复生
I missed him and I wanted him back.

431
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,840
现在有点诡异  对吧
This is weird, right?

432
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,320
家里只有外公一个人
Pop-Pop was the only one in my family

433
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,690
鼓励我追求科学的真谛
who encouraged me to pursue science.

434
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,040
但你没让他起死回生  对吗
But you didn't bring him back, did you?

435
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,810
我得到的礼物是林肯积木
Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.

436
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,390
用林肯积木可以搭出很多有意思的东西
Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs,

437
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,620
但是搭不出外公
but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em.

438
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,880
你现在竟然敢向我提出要求
And now you're here asking me for something--

439
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,100
要我救你
to save you.

440
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,510
抱歉了  圣诞老人先生
Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle,

441
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,210
今天不能让你如愿了
but today's not your day.

442
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,010
我要让你死在这里
I'm leaving you here to rot,

443
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,650
希望食人魔把你吃到尸骨无存
and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.

444
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,370
我拿起万能钥匙
I take the skeleton key,

445
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,220
扔进峡谷里
and I toss it into the chasm,

446
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,950
离开之前  我给了圣诞老人的
and on the way out, I give Santa

447
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,650
肥果冻肚皮闪电一踹
a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
bowl full of jelly  装满果冻的碗  是圣诞歌的歌词
形容圣诞老人的肚子

448
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,880
好吧
Okay.

449
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,160
沃罗威茨和斯图尔特被麻痹了  圣诞老人死了
So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead,

450
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,000
而我居然不和女友上床跑来玩这个
and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.

451
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,390
圣诞老人
Santa?

452
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,150
你好  谢尔顿
Oh, hello, Sheldon.

453
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,750
你应该在睡觉啊
You should be asleep.

454
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,290
那你就别在靴子上挂铃铛吵人睡觉啊
Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.

455
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,340
我想跟你聊聊
I've been wanting to talk to you.

456
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,910
抱歉在你小时候  我让你失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy.

457
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,860
我能施展魔法做到不少事
I-I can do a lot of magical things,

458
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,570
但遗憾的是
but unfortunately

459
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,920
我没有能力让你的外公死而复生
bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.

460
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,670
我明白
I understand.

461
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,230
但我有特别的礼物送给你
But I-I do have something special for you.

462
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,870
闭上眼
Close your eyes.

463
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,130
希望是火车
Oh, I hope it's a train.

464
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,290
比火车要好
Oh, it's better than a train.

465
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,520
两辆火车吗
Two trains?

466
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,240
更好
Better.

467
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,420
我要有三辆火车啦
I'm getting three trains.

468
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,840
好了  睁眼吧
Okay, open 'em.

469
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,090
这是回敬你把我留在地牢
This is for leaving me in the dungeon

470
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,580
让食人魔给生吞活剥了
to be eaten alive by ogres!

471
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,900
等等  别激动
Wait, uh, uh, hang on.

472
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,030
容我解释下
I-In my defense...

473
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,830
呵呵呵  你个大傻帽
Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork!
