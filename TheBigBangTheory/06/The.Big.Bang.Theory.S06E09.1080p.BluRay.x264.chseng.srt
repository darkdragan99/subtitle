1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,570
他们不一样
They are not.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,280
就一样
They are, too.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,410
种种数据显示  你的假设完全不能成立
Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,430
现在纯粹是你的智商在死鸭子嘴硬
You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,740
是你正表现出对谈话主题的
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,780
高度无知
of the subject matter.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,330
木乃伊与僵尸是一模一样的东西
Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,630
是吗
Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,670
木乃伊全身裹着绷带呢
Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,310
那是人家的时尚风格
That's called a fashion choice.

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,180
好吧  是你自己自讨苦吃
All right, you brought this on yourself.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,080
谢尔顿  说死丫的
Sheldon, get him.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,930
如果你被僵尸咬了
If a zombie bites you,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,450
你也会变为僵尸
you turn into a zombie.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,270
但如果是木乃伊咬你
However, if a mummy bites you,

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,150
你只会变成有木乃伊咬痕的白痴
all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,270
所以你就像是个
So, like a zombie,

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,730
被人啃掉下半身的僵尸一样
that's been eaten from the waist down,

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,390
说的话完全"站不住脚"
you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,990
真乖  赏你个饼干
Good boy. Here's a cookie.

21
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,670
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,250
大家伙在干嘛呢
Hey, fellas, what's going on?

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,940
又在辩木乃伊跟僵尸呢
Mummies and zombies again.

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,430
他们不一样好吗
Oh, they're not the same thing.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,230
也赏你个饼干
You get a cookie, too.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,700
谢谢
Thanks.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,010
你们猜谁今早弄了台新车
Guess who picked up his new car this morning?

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,300
恭喜你啊
Congratulations.

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,410
-里面有新车味吗  -有的
- Does it have that new car smell? - Yep!

30
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,810
只要不让我妈上车就有
For as long as I can keep my mother out of it.

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,110
你们想看一下的话
If you want to check it out later,

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,580
就停在外面哦  294号位
it's parked right out front, space 294.

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,960
等等  294号位吗
I'm sorry-- 294?

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,220
-是的  -那是我的停车位
- Yeah. - That's my parking spot.

35
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,540
你怎么会有个停车位
Why do you have a parking spot?

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,830
你都没车  你连车都不开
You don't have a car. You don't even drive.

37
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,920
那无关紧要
It doesn't matter.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,610
那停车位是我的
That's my spot.

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,880
可能是看你从不停车  就重分配给人了吧
Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,550
我也从不用我的乳头啊
Well, I'm not using my nipples, either.

41
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,550
他们也要帮我重分配吗
Maybe they should reassign those.

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,280
谢尔顿  哪天你买车了
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car,

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
他们肯定还会再给你个停车位的
I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,800
我不要别的停车位
I don't want another parking space.

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,040
我要我那个停车位
I want my parking space.

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,060
那可是完美车位
It's perfect.

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,610
那车位是在角落
It's a corner spot,

48
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,470
车门被旁车门撞凹的机率少了一半
cutting the risk of door-dings in half.

49
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,840
而走到楼入口处也只需仅仅28步
It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance.

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,370
旁边的树能在热天提供遮阴
The nearby tree provides shade on hot days

51
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,390
而且那树还是一只可爱小松鼠的家
and is also home to a delightful squirrel.

52
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,510
这很难得呢
Which is fortuitous

53
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,890
毕竟大多数的松鼠都是讨厌鬼
because most squirrels are real jerks.

54
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,910
故事虽好
Fun story.

55
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,200
但你就是没车啊
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.

56
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,890
别想转移话题
Don't try to change the subject.

57
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,270
我们是在谈停车位
This is about a parking space.

58
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,430
跟有没有车毫无关系
It has nothing to do with cars.

59
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,720
你有听到你自己说的话了吗
Are you listening to yourself?

60
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,120
我当然都有听啊
I always listen to myself.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,300
这是我人生中最美好的事之一呢
It's one of the great joys of my life.

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,060
快把你的车开离我的宝位
Now, get your car out of my spot.

63
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,220
不要
Nope.

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,390
你不仁
Very well.

65
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,550
那就别怪我不义了
You leave me no choice.

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,170
看个屁啊  你个白痴松鼠
What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,980
生活大爆炸 第六季  第九集

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,090
塞伯特校长  请听我的理由
President Siebert, listen to reason.

69
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,380
我知道我没有在使用那个停车位
Yeah, I understand I don't use the parking spot,

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,890
但这不是重点  我...
but that's not the point. I...

71
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,390
我知道你说过别打去你家
Yes, I'm aware you told me not to call you at home.

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,430
但这是因为你不应门啊
But you didn't answer the door!

73
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,120
我知道你在家
And I know you were there,

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,490
我当时从信件投递口看到你在里面了
because I saw you through the mail slot.

75
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,950
你这话够掉身份啊
Well, that's some salty language.

76
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,900
您别忘了您重点大学校长的身份啊
May I remind you that you're the president of a major university,

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,690
而不是个脏话俱乐部的主席
not the president of the Potty Mouth Club.

78
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,130
你又说
There it is again.

79
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,760
你也是用那张嘴亲你母亲的吗
Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?

80
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,050
好吧  请节哀顺变
Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,850
晚安
Oh...! Good night, sir.

82
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,900
太扯了
Unbelievable.

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,190
他说我的停车位给沃罗威茨不为过
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot

84
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,030
因为他是学校的重要资产
because he's a high-profile asset to the university.

85
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,110
他也没说错啊
Well, he's not wrong.

86
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,350
霍华德好歹也上过国际太空站了
Howard did go to the International Space Station.

87
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,230
那都是五周前的事了
Yeah, that was five weeks ago.

88
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,570
他还想靠那件事占便宜多久啊
How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?

89
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,960
算了啦  谢尔顿
Sheldon, let it go.

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,980
也不是什么大事
It's not a big deal.

91
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,400
莱纳德  不反抗只会令他更予取予求
No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,190
先是占了我停车位
It starts with a parking space.

93
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,240
食髓知味了以后呢
Where does it end?

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,860
就像我爸说过的一样
It's like my dad always said,

95
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,970
"一开始只说不能酒后开车
"First they say you can't drink and drive.

96
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,790
才刚同意  就立刻再进一步说
Next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old

97
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,040
不许让10岁儿子开车  而自己去后座睡觉"
take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,670
你这故事只让我更心疼你妈
All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.

99
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,690
莱纳德  你是我最好的朋友
Leonard, you're my best friend.

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,070
为什么你从不跟我同一阵线
Why don't you ever take my side?

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,440
因为我从没懂过你那阵线
Because I can never understand your side!

102
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,210
还我
Give it back.

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,540
很抱歉
I'm sorry,

104
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,070
您是指...
but could you be more specific?

105
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,390
我的钢铁侠头盔
My Iron Man helmet.

106
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,290
库萨帕里看见你拿了  还回来
Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.

107
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,510
哦  那个啊
Oh, that.

108
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,790
听我说  这东西我想要
Well, see, I wanted it,

109
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,410
你又不用  我就拿了
and you weren't using it.

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,720
我们现在生活规则好像是这样哦
Apparently, those are the rules we live by now.

111
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,690
报复
Payback--

112
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,930
还真是让人想骂脏话  不是吗
it truly is the B word, isn't it?

113
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,630
谢尔顿  那可是价值500美元的限量珍藏品
Sheldon, that is a $500 limited edition collectible,

114
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,750
快还给我
and I want it back.

115
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,230
我也想还给你  但很遗憾的是
I'd love to help you out, but unfortunately,

116
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,440
我在用呢
I'm using it.

117
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,330
好吧
Fine.

118
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,450
那我把你的学位证拿走
I'm taking your diploma.

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,210
尽管拿
Go ahead.

120
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,550
你这辈子唯一"拿到"博士学位的机会哦
That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,200
里面闻起来怪怪的
It smells funny in here.

122
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,890
我们真以你为傲  艾米
We're so proud of you, Amy.

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,040
-你的初次比基尼蜜蜡脱毛呢  -对啊
- Your first bikini wax. - Yeah.

124
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,820
感觉如何
So, how you doing?

125
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,240
有点小敏感  但还好
A little sensitive, but not bad.

126
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,250
一般都需要这么长时间的吗
Does it always take that long?

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,830
不  他们一般不需要跑去多拿点蜜蜡
Uh, no, they usually don't have to go out and get more wax.

128
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,080
除完我感觉都轻了5磅
I feel like I'm five pounds lighter.

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,410
真的吗  你确定只有5磅吗
Really? Only five?

130
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,890
谁想来一杯
Hey, anybody want a drink?

131
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,560
-好的  -当然
- Okay. - Sure.

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,870
你昨晚是不是也得听他
So, did you spend last night hearing

133
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,010
抱怨那场白痴的停车位大战
about this silly parking space fight, too?

134
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,150
抱怨了好几小时
For hours.

135
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,870
幸好  因为谢尔顿戴着那个白痴面具
Fortunately, I couldn't understand most of it

136
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,210
他说的话我大部分都听不懂
'cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.

137
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,210
霍华德气得要死
Howard was so angry

138
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,090
我不得不把过敏药混在他的冰淇淋里
I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream
Benadryl是儿童抗过敏药
一般小朋友吃了都会想睡觉

139
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,310
才能让他消停睡觉
to get him to fall asleep.

140
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,240
我猜这就是我们
I guess this is what we get

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,180
跟两个荷尔蒙爆棚的雄性霸主在一起的后果
for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.

142
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,460
一山不容二虎
At some point,

143
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,300
他们总有一天得角斗分生死
they're bound to lock horns.

144
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,010
我猜你说的"角"  是他们从动漫展
I'm assuming these are some kind of horns

145
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,000
买的什么号"角"之类吧
they bought at Comic-Con?

146
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,520
我很抱歉学校收回谢尔顿的车位
I'm really sorry they took Sheldon's spot away.

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,570
他不该因为霍华德
He shouldn't have to suffer

148
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,090
现在是个大咖  而蒙受苦难啊
just because Howard's such a big deal now.

149
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,970
是啊  谢尔顿应该大度点
I know, Sheldon should just let Howard

150
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,270
也让霍华德有一次受瞩目的短暂机会
have his little moment in the sun.

151
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
你这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,740
霍华德这辈子不会再上太空了
Well, Howard's never gonna go to space again,

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,500
但谢尔顿一辈子都会是个天才
but Sheldon will always be a genius.

154
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,170
有道理
You're right.

155
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,890
谢尔顿肯定有机会重获个好车位啊
And I'm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again,

156
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,620
假设他哪天真对科学做了有价值的贡献就行
if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,430
假设与哪天吗
If and when?

158
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,190
好了  或许我们该换个话题
Okay, maybe we should change the subject.

159
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,700
艾米  你"小妹妹"那里感觉如何
Amy, how are your lady parts?

160
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,420
还凉飕飕的吗
Still chilly down there?

161
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,740
打住
Hang on.

162
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,030
谢尔顿所有的理论
None of Sheldon's theories

163
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,980
都未获得最终证实
have ever been definitively proven.

164
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,670
而我的老公可是真正上过太空
My husband actually went to outer space.

165
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,820
那的确是一项令人赞叹的成就
That's an impressive accomplishment.

166
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,050
他现在成功鼓舞了百万美国人
He's now an inspiration to millions of Americans

167
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,300
就算你不特别  甚至不够格
who know you don't have to be special

168
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,820
也都可以登上外太空
or even qualified to go into space.

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
我还记得我第一次尝试比基尼脱毛
You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax.

170
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,790
我姐姐是用熔化的蜡笔和胶带帮我
My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape.

171
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,770
那主意蠢透了...
It's a bad idea...

172
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,730
天啊  艾米
Gosh, Amy.

173
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,530
我感觉到了一丝敌意啊
I'm sensing a little hostility.

174
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,710
是不是因为  你们的性生活
Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,

175
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,560
跟谢尔顿的研究一样纯属"理论"啊
your sex life is also theoretical?

176
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,160
毒啊
Damn.

177
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,920
是啊  至少等我们开搞了后
Yeah, well, at least when we do make love,

178
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,210
谢尔顿脑子里不会想着他妈妈
Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother.

179
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,940
没错  我就是在明嘲暗讽
And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference

180
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,110
霍华德他这辈子痴迷着想
to Howard's lifelong obsession

181
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,940
爬回他妈宽敞无比的子宫的心里
to crawl back into her spacious womb.

182
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,220
时至今日  我一看见蜡笔
Anyway, to this day, I still can't see

183
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,000
还是会吓得赶紧夹紧双腿
a box of crayons without crossing my legs.

184
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,010
我没必要听你冷嘲热讽
I don't have to take this.

185
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,960
老娘现在就回家跟我的老公做爱
I'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now.

186
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,080
可能还让他干我"停车位"呢
Maybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot.

187
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,190
虽然听起来很淫荡  但我不是那个意思
Which sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way!

188
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,370
好吧  另外一个问题
Okay, here's another one

189
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,650
如果僵尸咬了吸血鬼
If a zombie bites a vampire,

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,780
然后吸血鬼咬了人类
and the vampire bites a human,

191
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,630
那那个人类会变成吸血鬼  还是僵尸
does the human become a vampire or a zombie?

192
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,560
或是僵血鬼
Or a zompire?

193
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,200
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

194
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,350
饼干拿来
Cookie.

195
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,930
我没有
I don't have any.

196
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,020
我才不无偿帮你
Well, I'm not giving it away.

197
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,350
你好呀  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

198
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,470
他坐在我的专位上
He's in my spot.

199
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,310
莱纳德  让他别裸体坐在我的专位上
Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.

200
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,570
霍华德  你这是干嘛
Howard, what are you doing?

201
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,390
他又没在坐
He wasn't using it.

202
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,300
而我刚好需要一块冰凉的皮革
And I needed a nice cool piece of leather

203
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,160
来[摩]擦我的光屁屁
to wiggle my naked ass on.

204
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,520
快滚开
Get off there.

205
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,000
把我的钢铁侠头盔还给我
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,620
把我的停车位还给我
Give me back my parking space.

207
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,310
你又不需要停车位
You don't need a parking space.

208
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,110
你连车都没有
You don't have a car.

209
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,830
你又不需要钢铁侠头盔
You don't need an Iron Man helmet.

210
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,720
你又不是钢铁侠
You're not Iron Man.

211
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,530
看来我们陷入僵局了
Well, we appear to have reached an impasse.

212
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,440
不过我得说  我原以为
And you know, I have to say, I thought

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,890
把你笔记本放我的大雕上  你会更生气呢
you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.

214
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,320
我刚还没发现  这招不赖啊
I didn't pick up on that. That's a nice touch.

215
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,810
霍华德·沃罗威茨

216
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,130
人家好激动
This is so exciting.

217
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,580
都感觉有点刺痛了
I'm feeling all tingly.

218
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,520
但也有可能是因为
Although that could just be

219
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,730
我才把比基尼部位除了毛哦
my newly defoliated bikini zone.

220
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,740
把好风
Keep a lookout.

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,410
这地方有一大堆校园保安
This place is swarming with campus security.

222
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,990
他们会骂死我们的
They will not hesitate to scold us.

223
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,510
死猪头
Freaking pigs.

224
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,110
谢尔顿·库珀

225
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,330
爽啊
Oh, yeah.

226
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,400
好的  现在
Okay, now,

227
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,740
把你的车开进来  我们就可以走人了
pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.

228
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,420
等等  我得把车留在这里吗
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?

229
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,950
对  记得拉手刹
Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake.

230
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,410
这样要拖走你车都得废很大劲
Really makes these things tough to budge.

231
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,260
在我停车以前  你到后座来一下
Before I park, come in the backseat.

232
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,830
我给你看看我今天做的事
I want to show you something I had done today.

233
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,360
好啊  我都好奇起来了
All right, color me intrigued.

234
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

235
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,080
你喷漆味吸高  嗨过头了吧
I think you're high on paint fumes.

236
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,780
老天  好多创口贴啊
And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.

237
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,480
你每一张结婚照里都有霍华德的妈妈
Okay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.

238
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,990
我能说什么呢  她可是"大"姑娘
What can I tell ya? She's a big girl.

239
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,740
不管看哪  她都赫然在目
Wherever you look, there she is.

240
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
再来点咖啡吗
More coffee?

241
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,910
不了  莱纳德要带我去听物理讲座
No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture,

242
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,310
咖啡会害让我睡不着
and coffee'll just keep me awake.

243
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,070
我去开门
Oh, I'll get it.

244
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,110
看来某人和伯纳黛特是一队的啊
Oh, looks like someone's on Team Bernadette.

245
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,100
霍华德在哪
Where's Howard?

246
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
他不在  怎么了
He's not here. What's wrong?

247
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,770
他让我的车被拖走了
He had my car towed.

248
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,130
花了我200美元才弄回来
It cost me $200 to get it back.

249
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,520
这么惨啊
Oh, no.

250
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,540
车本来在哪停着的呢
Where was it parked?

251
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,510
在谢尔顿的停车位
In Sheldon's spot.

252
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,610
不对啊  谢尔顿没有车位
That doesn't make sense. Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

253
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,610
是不是在霍华德的车位呀
Was it maybe in Howard's spot?

254
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,590
别装傻了  丫头
Don't play dumb with me, sister.

255
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,650
告诉你丈夫  他欠我200块
You tell your husband he owes me $200.

256
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,390
这也说不通啊
Well, that doesn't make sense, either.

257
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,640
怎么会
Why not?

258
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,370
因为车是我拖走的
Because I'm the one who had it towed.

259
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,030
你
You?

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,360
没想到姐这招吧
Didn't see that one coming, did ya?

261
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,280
是吗
Oh, yeah?

262
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,550
那你想得到姐这招吗
Well, you're not gonna see this coming.

263
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,770
天啊  你没事吧
Oh, my God, are you okay?!

264
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,340
你包里装了什么鬼东西啊
What the hell do you have in there?!

265
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,800
只有钱包  钥匙和一个装满硬币的咖啡罐
Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change

266
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,890
我正准备到银行存呢
I've been meaning to take to the bank.

267
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,490
别动  我去拿点冰块
Don't move. I'll get some ice.

268
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,390
你没事吧
Are you okay?

269
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,570
离我远点  不然我发誓
Get away from me or I swear to God

270
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,360
我会把你"那块"撕烂
I will rip out what's left of your pubes!

271
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,270
-给  -谢谢
- Here. - Thanks. Ah!

272
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,580
艾米  你不觉得这事有点失控吗
Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?

273
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,480
老天  你才觉得吗
Gee, you think?!

274
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,800
确实

佩妮  我和伯纳黛特很抱歉

276
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,530
打她的是你  我做啥了
You hit her! What did I do?

277
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,560
你拖走了我的车
You had my car towed.

278
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,370
谁叫你在霍华德的车位停车的
You were parked in Howard's spot!

279
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,850
我是停在谢尔顿的车位上的
I was parked in Sheldon's spot!

280
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,480
谢尔顿根本就没有车位
Sheldon doesn't have a spot!

281
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,220
姑娘们  我觉得我得去趟急救室
Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.

282
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,440
-好  我们走  -我来开车
- Okay, let's go. - I'll drive.

283
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,690
你可以看看拖吊车把我的车刮成什么样了
You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.

284
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,350
拖吊车根本没刮到你的车
The tow truck didn't scratch your car.

285
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,050
-你怎么知道  -因为是老娘亲自拖的
- How do you know? - 'Cause I did it!

286
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,100
早啊  史蒂文斯教授
Morning, Professor Stevens.

287
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,270
别盯着白板看
Don't look at that whiteboard.

288
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,380
那是我的数学公式  不关你的事
That's my math, not your math.

289
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,560
继续走你的路  事儿妈
Keep walking, nosey.

290
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,980
你又搞什么鬼呢
What the hell are you doing?

291
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,390
你说我没有使用我的车位  所以
You said I'm not using my space, so...

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,070
我正在使用
I'm using it.

293
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,020
你得闪边了
Okay, you need to move now.

294
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,710
才不
No, I don't.

295
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,160
你总不可能一直占着那里吧
You can't stay there forever.

296
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,470
事实上  我腿上绑的塑"尿"袋说是可能的
Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can.

297
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,530
放弃吧  沃罗威茨
Give up, Wolowitz.

298
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,250
你的对手比你足智多谋  你赢不了的
You've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat.

299
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,330
你没有任何招能...
There is nothing you could possibly do to...

300
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,270
那玩意没用的  谢尔顿
Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon!

301
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,480
作用可大了
Oh, yes, they are!

302
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,270
不  你说啥来着
I mean, what?!

303
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,060
我警告你  谢尔顿
I'm warning you, Sheldon!

304
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,850
你吓唬谁啊
Your threats are empty!

305
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,120
我是赶不走的
Nothing can move me!

306
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,780
快住手
Stop that!

307
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,360
滚出我的车位
Get out of my spot!

308
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,970
够了
That's it.

309
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,330
我要叫保安了
I am calling campus security!

310
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,520
你准备好被骂得狗血淋头吧
You prepare for the scolding of your life!

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,020
你们两个蠢货干嘛呢
What are you idiots doing?!

312
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,570
他要谋杀我  莱纳德
He's trying to kill me, Leonard!

313
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,960
电玩游戏与摇滚乐
Video games and rock music

314
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,510
令他变得对暴力麻木不仁
have desensitized him to violence!

315
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,620
拜托你好好劝几句
Would you please talk some sense

316
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,250
你的疯子室友行吗
into your lunatic roommate?

317
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,870
你俩都像疯子似的
You're both acting like lunatics.

318
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,920
-一个停车位而已  -不仅仅是停车位
- It's just a parking spot. - It's not just a parking spot!

319
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
他无法接受现在
He can't handle the fact that

320
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,790
我比他还大咖的事实
I'm a bigger deal than he is now.

321
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,440
真是荒谬
Oh, preposterous!

322
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,480
我全权负责
I have been solely responsible

323

这间大学的六回圈量子引力计算

我改变了世人
I have changed the way we think

325
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,920
对玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体的想法
about Bose-Einstein condensates,

326
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,570
而且是我让咱学校的食堂贩卖机
and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters

327
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,950
出售花生酱三明治饼
in the cafeteria vending machine.

328
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,160
也许你不知道这些
Maybe you missed that news while you were

329
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,850
因为当时你像个傻子一样在太空里瞎飘
floating around like a goof in outer space.

330
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,380
恕我失陪  我要工作了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

331
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,590
你相信他说的是人话吗
Can you believe this guy?

332
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,040
我不相信你居然想碾死他
What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.

333
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,120
别装得好像你没想过这么做一样
Oh, like you've never thought of doing that.

334
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,920
别因为我实现梦想而恨我
Don't hate me just because I lived the dream.

335
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,410
嘿  真是辆好车哦
Hey. Sweet ride!

336
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,820
你在车里干什么
What are you doing in there?!

337
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,710
闯入你的新车玩玩啊
Just breaking in your new car.

338
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,170
别这样  快住手
Stop that! You stop that!

339
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,670
知道常言怎么说吗
You know what they say?

340
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,340
君子报仇  裸着才完
Revenge is a dish best served nude.

341
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,940
有时间吗
Hey, got a minute?

342
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,780
当然  请进
Oh, of course, come in.

343
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,550
这是枚货真价实的中国飞镖
This is an authentic Chinese throwing star,

344
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,470
我得警告你
and I must warn you,

345
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,330
我在电影里见过很多人扔这个
I have seen many people throw them in movies.

346
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,180
冷静
Calm down.

347
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,900
霍华德有话跟你说
Howard has something he wants to say to you.

348
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,350
好了
All right.

349
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,340
谢尔顿  这场停车位之战开始后
Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started,

350
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,930
我不知道你是个如此疯狂的混...
I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard...

351
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,790
霍华德
Howard...

352
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,970
跟着练习时的剧本走
that's not how we practiced it.

353
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,250
我不知道那个停车位对你来说这么重要
I had no idea how much that spot meant to you.

354
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,550
总之  我打了电话给塞伯特校长
Anyway, I called President Siebert

355
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,700
我跟他说争停车位不值得
and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot,

356
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,010
你留着吧  我就停在
so you keep it, and I'll park

357
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,360
街对面的停车场好了
in the structure across the street.

358
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,660
霍华德  谢谢你
Well, Howard, thank you.

359
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,890
你这样做很有风度
It's quite a gesture on your part.

360
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,780
你证明了你是豁然大度的汉子
You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.

361
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,310
谢谢
Thank you.

362
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,960
我完全不能接受这结果
Which I find totally unacceptable.

363
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,170
我一定得比人大度才行
I must be the bigger man.

364
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,170
因此  你可以用我的停车位直到

365
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,660
我学会开车  或是有了蝙蝠车

谢谢
Well, thanks.

368
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,840
我不知道说什么好了
I don't know what to say.

369
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,420
没什么好说的
There is nothing to say.

370
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,000
除了"你才是大度真汉子"
Except I'm the bigger man.

371
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,840
我没开玩笑  快说
I'm not kidding. Say it.

372
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,890
说吧
Just say it.

373
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,040
你才是大度真汉子  谢尔顿
You're the bigger man, Sheldon.

374

我相信这个是你的

告诉你  如果戴着这个进银行

保安会把你摁倒在地

378
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,480
大家来干一杯吧
I'd like to propose a toast--

379
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,020
敬恩怨一笔勾销

敬恩怨一笔勾销

381

我有点开心发生这样的事

我也是

有什么可以效劳的
