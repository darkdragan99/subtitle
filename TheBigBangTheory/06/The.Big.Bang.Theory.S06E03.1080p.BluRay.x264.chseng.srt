1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,990
妮妮
Hey, Bernie.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,790
我的性感小太空人还好吗
Hey, how's my little astronautie hottie?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,270
还行吧
Okay, I guess.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,280
只是被困在这...
It's just, being cooped up in this...

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
"锡盒"里有段时日  快受不了
tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,080
坚持下去啊  再多撑几天
Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go,

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,190
-就能回家了  -我知道
- and then you'll be home. - I know.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,190
我要继续工作了
I got to get back to work.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,870
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - Love you too.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,040
妮妮
Hey, Bernie?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,290
你走之前可以帮我做件事吗
Before you go, can you do something for me?

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,090
你想我做什么呢
What do you want me to do?

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,090
是这样的
Okay, here it is.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,530
我好想念地心引力
I really miss gravity.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,680
你可以让我看看东西垂直落下的样子吗
Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
真的吗  你真想看啊
Really, you're serious?

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,790
好吧
Okay.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,480
哎哟  宝贝  我要爽死了
Oh, baby, you're killing me.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,020
谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon?

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,150
今天来了一个你的包裹  你妈寄的
This came for you today. It's from your mom.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,910
谢谢你  佩妮
Thank you, Penny.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,930
稍等...  给
Yeah, wait... here.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,170
你的辛苦费
For your troubles.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
妈呀  整整一元大洋呢
Oh, boy, a whole dollar.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,760
我可以不用去送报了
Now, I can quit my paper route.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,700
-里面是什么啊  -根本无所谓
- So, what's in it? - Mmm, doesn't matter.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,020
通常他都是隔着盒子玩[模型玩具]而已
Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,510
是我小时候写的日志与研究报告啦
Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,940
真有爱
Aw, how cute.

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,270
这就跟日记一样吗
Is this like a diary?

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,100
不是  那是我的如厕训练日志
No, that's my potty training journal.

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,370
-不是吧  你的如厕训练日志啊  -是的
- Really, your potty training journal? - Yeah.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,200
字迹难看  多多包涵
And forgive my crude penmanship.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,950
我六岁之后才开始打字
I didn't start typing until I was six.

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,200
"8月7号  上午8点42分
"August 7, 8:42 A.M.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,010
这真是太丢人了  这尿布是怎么回事"
This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?"

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,990
后面还有图表
There are some charts in the back

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,830
记录我的屎形  屎色与软硬度
where I kept track of shape, color and consistency.

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,240
真恶心
Disgusting.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,570
真正恶心的是他到现在都还会做记录
No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,110
-你为什么要这些玩意啊  -别别别
- Why do you need all this stuff...? - No, no, no, no...

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,500
-抱歉  -问得好
- Sorry! - I am glad you asked.

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,900
你知道希格斯玻色子吗
Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
希格斯玻色子:  又称为上帝粒子]

44
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,430
当然知道啊  新闻上都有
Of course, it is... it's been in the news.

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,050
超出名的玻色子
And it's a very famous boson.

46
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,360
你少来了
Nice try.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
在1964年时  彼得·希格斯博士
Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs,

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
一个成功自信的物理学家
accomplished self-promoter and physicist,

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,130
写了文章假定一种亚原子粒子
he wrote a paper postulating the existence

50
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,840
"希格斯玻色子"的存在
of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,620
当年  这文章被人给驳回了
Now, initially, the paper was rejected,

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,990
知道最近  才验证出  其实他是对的
but recently, he was proven right.

53
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,140
现在他要得诺贝尔奖  简直探囊取物
And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,680
这不就是我刚说的吗
Yeah, that's basically what I said.

55
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,670
重点是
The point is

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,180
希格斯正被人赞赏着他50年前的发现
Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago,

57
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,410
这让我不禁思考
so that got me thinking,

58
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,780
说不定我早想到了值得得奖的东西
perhaps I've already hit upon the idea

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,060
而它们就藏在这些日志里
that will win me my Nobel prize.

60
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,840
原来他们会颁发奖项给
I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,030
拉粑粑进小马桶呀
for making boom-boom in the potty.

62
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,600
你真的觉得里面能找出什么科学发现吗
You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,480
这箱子里只有我上幼儿园前的作品
Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school.

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
后面还有很多呢
There's a good deal more to come.

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,390
我真正在学术理论上取得进步
I didn't really hit my academic stride

66
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,790
是在我取消了浪费时间的"户外游玩"之后
until I cut out that time-suck known as "playing outdoors."

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,060
你打算花费大把时间
So, you're going to spend hours and hours

68
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,400
重读这些玩意啊
combing through all this stuff?

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,430
这话说得对
That's a good point.

70
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,400
我的时间太宝贵了
My time is much too valuable.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,890
或许我该找个人帮我干这事
You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me.

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,390
找个有着基本科学知识
You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science,

73
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,100
但在苦力活上更有天分的人
but whose real talents lie in menial labor.

74
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,360
想都别想
Not gonna happen.

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,850
我要不是觉得你能行
Yeah, well, if I didn't think you could handle it,

76
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,320
我才不会问你呢
I wouldn't be asking.

77
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,110
真要人帮忙  你还是去找个研究生吧
If you want help, just hire a grad student.

78
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,270
我说不定能帮上忙啊
Maybe I could do it.

79
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,500
就你  真的吗
You, really?

80
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,710
你会懂得评估我作品的好坏吗
You can assess the quality of my work?

81
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,310
好吧  给
Okay, um, here.

82
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,540
这是我五岁时写的
I wrote this when I was five years old.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
"证明代数拓扑永远不会有
"A proof that algebraic topology can never have

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,060
不会自我冲突的交换群"
a non-self contradictory set of abelian groups."

85
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,960
在你眼里  我就是一金发猴子是吧
I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?

86
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,760
这可是自己说  我什么都没说
You said it, not me.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,700
生活大爆炸 第六季第三集

88
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,740
好的  詹森女士
All right, Ms. Jenson.

89
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,520
开始之前  需要来点东西提神吗
Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment?

90
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
水  咖啡  茶
Water, coffee, tea,

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,670
或来根大麻烟吗
a marijuana cigarette?

92
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,340
不用了  谢谢  不需要
No, thanks. I'm fine.

93
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,690
不用客气哦
Now, are you sure?

94
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,800
这玩意大家都抽
Everyone's smoking them.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,970
我觉得这玩意爽爆了
I think they're the best.

96
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,920
我不碰毒
I don't do drugs.

97
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,250
太棒了
Excellent, yeah.

98
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,570
刚是陷阱题
That was a ruse.

99
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,050
那玩意才不爽
They're not the best.

100
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,020
物理才是最爽的
Physics is the best.

101
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,880
随便说句  选咖啡也是不行的哦
And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice.

102
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,590
好了  资料上写着你来自爱荷华州的得梅因
All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa.

103
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,070
你的理论物理学以最优异的成绩
Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics

104
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,750
毕业于斯坦福大学
from Stanford University.

105
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,410
两年前  你耳朵受持续性感染所苦
Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection.

106
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,710
希望那没影响你的听力
I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.

107
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,190
没有  当然没有
No, of course not.

108
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,370
你是怎么知道的
How did you know about that?

109
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,630
我对你的背景做了全面的调查
I did a comprehensive background check.

110
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,390
医疗记录  信用记录  犯罪史等等
Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.

111
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,400
我相信你已经缴清了那些停车罚单了吧
I trust you paid off those parking tickets.

112
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,150
是的  我付清了
Yes, I did.

113
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,380
很好  听力没问题
Hearing unimpaired, good.

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,860
库珀博士  我真的很希望能得到这个机会
Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position.

115
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,970
能为您这样才华洋溢的人做事
It would be an incredible honor to work for

116
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,550
真是我天大的荣幸
a man of your brilliance.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,940
溜须拍马是没用的  詹森女士
Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,900
陈述的是事实  又何来逢迎拍马
It's not flattery if it's the truth.

119
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,280
谢谢  欢迎加入
Well, thank you. Welcome aboard.

120
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,770
你最近有跟霍华德通话吗
You talk to Howard lately?

121
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,310
有啊  就昨晚
Uh, yeah, last night.

122
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,240
他一直让我把铅笔从空中落下给他看
He kept making me drop pencils for him.

123
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,650
感觉好不舒服哦
I got uncomfortable.

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,300
谢尔顿  但愿你饿了
Hey, Sheldon, hope you're hungry.

125
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,760
今天中饭有通心粉和...
They're serving macaroni and...

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,060
芝士哟
cheese.

127
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,450
厉害
Smooth.

128
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,550
-你好  -你们好
- Hi. - Hello.

129
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,650
谢尔顿  你不介绍一下吗
Sheldon, aren't you going to introduce us?

130
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,720
不必  有人会为我代劳
No. I have people for that now.

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,760
你来
You're up.

132
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,350
我是艾利克斯  库珀博士的新助手
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.

133
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,400
恭喜你  同时也愿上帝怜悯你的灵魂
Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul.

134
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,160
我是莱纳德  这位是拉杰
I'm Leonard. This is Raj.

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,470
很高兴见到你
It's nice to meet you.

136
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,000
能与库珀博士共事  我非常兴...
I'm so excited to be working with Dr...

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,900
詹森女士  闲聊请留到休息时间
Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson.

138
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,650
对了  我们没有休息时间
Yeah, FYI, there will be no breaks.

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,820
我得继续工作了
I should probably get to work.

140
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,250
她看起来不错
She seems nice.

141
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,450
喂  你都有女朋友了
Hey, you already got a girlfriend.

142
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,770
所以这妞归我
I call dibs.

143
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,840
我就说了一句"她看起来不错"
All I said was, "she seems nice."

144
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,660
是啊  可我爱上她了
Yeah, well, I love her.

145
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,810
没想到今天你会打给我
Hey, I wasn't expecting to hear from you today.

146
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,740
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

147
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,800
不  不是很好
Uh, no, not really.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,190
怎么了
What's wrong?

149
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,850
还记得联盟号宇宙飞船吗
Well, remember the... Soyuz capsule

150
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,320
那个要来接我们回地球的玩意
they were sending to bring us home?

151
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,290
被推迟了
It's delayed.

152
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,940
我们至少还要再这里呆上一周
We're gonna be here at least another week.

153
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,750
或许10天左右
Maybe ten days.

154
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,580
俄罗斯人说的  我也不敢信
It's the Russians, so you don't know.

155
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,070
1957年 俄罗斯把一只狗  "莱卡"给送上太空
五个小时后因宇宙飞行服隔热不佳成为"火烧狗"
目前它的尸体与当年的太空舱还滞留在地球轨道上
他们送上来的狗  尸体都没回去呢
They left dogs up here in the '60s.

156
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,130
拜托  霍华德
Come on, Howard.

157
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,900
没人会把你留那里不管的
No one's leaving you up there.

158
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,940
我不知道我还能坚持多久
I don't know how much longer I can take this.

159
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,300
我睡不着
I can't sleep,

160
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,660
零重力让我胃酸倒流得厉害
and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux.

161
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,580
我的抗酸补钙果味咀嚼片就剩最后3片了
I'm down to my last three Tums.

162
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,080
你会没事的
You're going to be fine.

163
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,140
你跟你妈参加减肥训练营  你都生存下来了
You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom.

164
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,460
令人开心的冰激凌不也是第二天就没了吗
And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two.

165
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,300
你先冷静下来  深呼吸几口气
Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.

166
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,950
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

167
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,210
我这是干嘛  把氧气都耗光了
What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen.

168
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,440
如果我死了  你要保证会为我守身如玉
If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.

169
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,820
很好
Oh, yeah.

170
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,780
我现在是个食男妇了
I'm a man-eater now.

171
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,690
好了  最后一步  用这个睫毛夹
Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler.

172
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,560
放在你睫毛上  然后贴近眼皮轻轻夹
You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.

173
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,830
不知道呢
Oh, I don't know.

174
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,790
迪士尼动画片《小飞侠》中
小飞侠彼得潘的精灵小伙伴
看起来像仙女小叮当的妇科医生的工具
Looks like something used by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.

175
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,930
虎克船长出自迪士尼动画片《小飞侠》
有着铁钩手的凶恶坏人
但愿她的妇科医生不是虎克船长
Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so...

176
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,140
你打给谁
Who are you calling?

177
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,540
我要跟谢尔顿视频聊天
I'm going to video-chat Sheldon.

178
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,250
如果我的新形象激发起他的性欲
If my new look leads to phone sex,

179
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,090
那你只好暂时离开房间一下咯
I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.

180
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,670
库珀博士办公室
Dr. Cooper's office.

181
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,720
你好  请问您是哪位
Oh, hello. Who are you?

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,920
我是艾利克斯  库珀博士的助手
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's assistant.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
有什么可以帮您的吗
Can I help you?

184
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,390
我要找谢尔顿
I'd like to speak to Sheldon.

185
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,920
抱歉  他让我过滤所有电话
I'm sorry. He's asked me to hold all calls

186
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,620
除非打来的人是斯蒂芬·霍金  他妈妈
unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother

187
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,860
或是来自未来的他自己
or himself from the future.

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,240
好吧
All right.

189
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,420
-告诉他艾米找他  -请问您贵姓
- Well, tell him Amy called. - Last name?

190
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,470
他知道我姓什么
He knows my last name.

191
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,400
我可是他的女朋友
I'm his girlfriend.

192
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,060
我们恋爱合同资料全有
We have a contract and everything.

193
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,030
我会发你份文件  以兹证明
I'll send you a PDF.

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,500
好的  我会转告他
All right, I will tell him you called.

195
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,650
-好奇怪啊  -怎么了
- Hmm, that's weird.  - What?

196
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,090
谢尔顿告诉我他新的助理叫艾利克斯
Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex.

197
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,250
却没说是个女艾利克斯
He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.

198
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,000
也许是他没发现人家是女的呢
Maybe he didn't notice.

199
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,200
有道理
You're right.

200
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
我完全不必担心谢尔顿
I don't have to worry about Sheldon.

201
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,760
确实
No, you do not.

202
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,030
我该担心的是那个女的
It's her I have to worry about.

203
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,720
艾米你不是吧
Oh, Amy, really?

204
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,500
-她会爱上谢尔顿的  -怎么可能
- She is not going to come on to Sheldon.  - Oh, really?

205
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,900
看看这萌脸
Look at this face.

206
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,450
一个女人每天与这萌脸共处八小时
How can any woman spend eight hours a day

207
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,950
怎么可能不爱上他呢
alone with this face and not fall in love with it?

208
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
首先我要说
Well, for starters,

209
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,420
那脸一开始讲话  就什么都幻灭了
at some point, that face starts talking.

210
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,890
艾米  这太夸张了
Amy, this is crazy.

211
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,590
你根本不用怀疑什么
You have nothing to be suspicious about.

212
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,880
我不是怀疑
I'm not suspicious.

213
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,250
我只是路过  跟我男朋友打个招呼
I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend

214
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,670
然后见见新助理
and meet his new assistant.

215
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,420
-可以走了吗  -稍等
- Can we go now?  - Hang on.

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

217
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
这还不明显吗
Isn't it obvious?

218
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,360
我在用体味申明领地
I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.

219
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,840
-得了吧  没用的  -真的吗
- Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.  - Really?

220
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,140
在你成为我闺蜜之前
Because just before you became my best friend,

221
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,520
我也对你整间公寓做了同样的事
I did this all over your apartment.

222
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,340
你的助理  有提到过我吗
Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?

223
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,950
其实还真有
In fact, she has.

224
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,580
她的原话是  "这家伙什么毛病"
Uh, her exact words were, "What is that guy's problem?"

225
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,860
她记住我了  好戏开始
I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.

226
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,360
你的冷冻优格  库珀博士
Here's your frozen yogurt, Dr. Cooper.

227
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,680
这该有意思了
This should be fun.

228
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,310
一半巧克力  一半香草
Half chocolate, half vanilla,

229
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,070
-挨着的  没搅在一起吗  -对
- side by side, not swirled? - Yes.

230
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,270
-半茶匙碎末  -彩虹的 不是巧克力的
Half a teaspoon of sprinkles? Rainbow, not chocolate.

231
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,010
-两颗樱桃  -一颗在上  一颗在下
- Two cherries?  - One on top, one on the bottom.

232
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,330
-茎拿掉么了  -呃
- Stems removed?  - Um...

233
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,280
上边的拿掉了
top one, yes.

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,940
下面的我没检查
I didn't check the one on the bottom.

235
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,470
不好意思  库珀博士
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.

236
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,460
没事的  艾利克斯
It's all right, Alex.

237
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,420
我并不生气  只是很失望
I'm not mad at you; I'm just disappointed.

238
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,100
等等  艾利克斯  要跟我们一起吃吗
Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?

239
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,170
艾利克斯  稍等片刻
Uh, Alex, a moment.

240
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,200
我有些话要跟霍夫斯塔德博士说
I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.

241
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,310
你觉得她跟我们一起坐合适吗
Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us,

242
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,360
就凭她的身份
given her station?

243
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,430
凭她的什么
Given her what?

244
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,140
要说我从PBS台的英剧里学到什么的话
If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS,

245
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,450
那就是仆人和他的同伴们都是坐楼下吃饭的
it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.

246
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,150
什么
What?

247
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,000
这是种仁慈  莱纳德
It's a kindness, Leonard.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,940
不然的话你就是在残酷地引诱他们
Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse

249
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,300
体验一下比满手油烟更高层次的生活
of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.

250
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,430
那必须
Oh, sure.

251
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,700
请坐吧
Please join us.

252
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,070
好的  谢谢
Oh, okay. Thank you.

253
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,020
艾利克斯  你毕业论文的题目是什么
So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?

254
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,850
在地球的L5拉格朗日点
I'm looking for Trojan asteroids

255
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,550
寻找特洛伊小行星
at Earth's L-Five Lagrange point.

256
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,460
这正巧是
Oh, that happens to be

257
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,560
库萨帕里博士的专业领域呢
Dr. Koothrappali's field of expertise.

258
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
你们有很多东西可以聊
You two have a lot to talk about.

259
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,010
真的吗
Is that true?

260
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,750
他还好吗
Is he all right?

261
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,270
不
No.

262
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,730
但跟你的老板相比
But compared to your boss,

263
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,150
他就是精神正常的代表
he's the poster boy for sanity.

264
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,130
还好啦  我这辈子都在和科学家打交道
It's okay, I've been around scientists all my life.

265
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,970
我爸是SETI的天文学家
My dad's an astronomer at SETI.

266
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,020
SETI  寻找外太空星球智慧生命计划
Oh, SETI-- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

267
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,380
把谢尔顿介绍给你爸  他就不用搜寻了
You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.

268
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,150
那你是做什么研究的
So, what kind of research are you doing?

269
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,220
-高能激光  -军用吗
- High-energy lasers.  - Ooh. Military?

270
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,050
还没呢  但我能从两英里外替人激光除毛
Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.

271
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,700
你是对的
You were right.

272
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,180
我没什么可担心的
I had nothing to worry about.

273
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,480
这骚货是你的问题  不是我的
That skank's your problem, not mine.

274
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,040
-你真幽默  霍夫斯塔德博士  -谢谢
- You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.  - Thank you.

275
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,450
啊  樱茎  樱茎
Aah! Cherry stem! Cherry stem!

276
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,700
华仔你还好吗  感觉好点了吗
How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?

277
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,380
好多了  谢谢  等一下
Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec.

278
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
听好了  我时间不多
Listen close. I don't have a lot of time.

279
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,670
我要你赶紧去我家
I need you to go to my house.

280
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,180
在我房间里有个火箭模型
In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket.

281
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,200
我要你把它带回你家
I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.

282
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,760
好的
Okay...

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,780
第二步  照着建一个14层楼高的版本
Step 2: build a version roughly 14 stories high.

284
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,610
装满火箭燃油来接我
Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.

285
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,630
我会给你把门留着的
I'll leave the door unlocked.

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,310
华仔  亲爱的  也许你该跟别人谈谈
Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone,

287
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,390
让他们知道你有些焦虑
let them know you're having a little anxiety.

288
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,550
不  不  我很好
No, no, I'm fine.

289
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,290
没有焦虑症
No anxiety!

290
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,910
咱们还是用暗号交流吧
We should probably talk in code.

291
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,710
从现在起  小蛙是我  三明治是你
From now on, "Frog" is me, "Sandwich" means you

292
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,200
柠檬是火箭  快点  三明治
and "Lemon" means rocket. So, come on, sandwich,

293
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,920
给我造架柠檬  小蛙要回家
build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home!

294
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,020
瞧你  还假装坚强
Look at you, putting on a brave face.

295
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,240
没什么好需要坚强的
There's nothing to be brave about.

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
-我没事  -真的吗
- Everything's fine. - Really?

297
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,100
我不知道你对灵长类动物行为知道多少
I don't know how much you know about primate behavior,

298
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,870
不过谢尔顿的助理绝对在向莱纳德求欢
but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard.

299
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,460
如果她是狒狒  肯定会弯下身
Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over

300
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,500
展示她那看似大红色蹭鞋垫的
and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters

301
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,240
鲜亮斑斓后臀
like a big red welcome mat.

302
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,810
顺便说下  如果在低年级毕业舞会上试这招
By the way, you try that at the junior prom,

303
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,260
会被踢出去的
you get kicked out.

304
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,850
好吧  也许她是在和他调情  可谁在乎啊
Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares?

305
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,760
我都不知道我现在和莱纳德的关系算什么
Look, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.

306
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,850
这是你的前额叶在说话
So says your prefrontal cortex.

307
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,970
但同时  你大脑中的边缘系统在计算
But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating

308
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,740
如果有另一个女人对莱纳德有兴趣
that if another woman is attracted to Leonard,

309
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,140
那肯定是因为他值得拥有
it must be because he's desirable.

310
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,650
他当然值得拥有了
Well, of course he's desirable.

311
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,420
他棒极了
I mean, he's great.

312
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,070
他聪明  温柔
He's smart, he's sweet,

313
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,530
而且在房事上  老天
and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew,

314
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,520
我告诉你  他真是拼了老命了
let me tell you, he really tries.

315
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,060
所以这事让你烦心
So it doesbother you.

316
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,700
好吧  是让我有点烦
Fine, it bothers me a little.

317
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,430
算了  这太傻了
No. You know what? This is stupid.

318
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,830
我才不烦呢
It doesn't bother me.

319
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,900
好吧  我很烦
Okay, it bothers me.

320
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,800
但只是因为她很捧场他的笑话
But only because she wouldn't stop laughing.

321
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,270
莱纳德没那么幽默搞笑
Leonard is not that funny.

322
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,980
这就是了
And there you have it;

323
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,810
前额叶理性对抗边缘系统的欲望
prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust.

324
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,430
如果这是拳击赛  就会叫做
If this were a boxing match, they might call it

325
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,380
"马尼拉的震颤"是拳王阿里的著名冠军争夺战
"扁桃体的震颤"
"The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala."

326
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,260
如果你是脑部学家
If you were a brain scientist,

327
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,870
你现在肯定会笑到尿裤子
you would be busting a gut right now!

328
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,140
今天工作怎么样
So, how was work today?

329
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,810
还行吧
Ah, it was all right, I guess.

330
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,480
用海氏急救法拯救樱桃梗卡气管的谢尔顿
Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon.

331
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,410
结果那梗还喷到拉杰的眼睛
Caught Raj right in the eye.

332
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,870
真的假的
You're kidding.

333
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,590
拉杰都得去医疗室了
No, Raj had to go to the nurse.

334
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,080
还有什么事吗
Wow. Anything else?

335
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,540
护士是个女的  所以他没法开口说话
Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her.

336
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,090
她不得不给他拿个芝麻街里的公仔
She had to bring him a Grover puppet

337
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,010
让他指出他哪里疼
so he could point at what hurt.

338
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,990
就这些吗
Is that it?

339
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,960
这还不够精彩吗
Isn't that enough?

340
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,930
有武器化的水果与公仔
It had the weaponized fruit and a puppet.

341
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,590
你还想听什么刺激的
What more do you want?

342
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,150
太好了  莱纳德  你在家
Oh, good, Leonard, you're here.

343
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,440
科学新闻
Science news.

344
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,820
你会有兴趣的
This will interest you.

345
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
佩妮  想涂指甲请随意
And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.

346
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
有什么新鲜事
What do you got?

347
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,950
我相信艾利克斯发现了
I believe Alex may have unearthed

348
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,560
我的小学科研项目
the grade school science project

349
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,070
也许就是我赢得诺贝尔大奖的机会
that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize.

350
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,360
请看
Behold.

351
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,230
磁铁  它们吸的是什么
"Magnet What Do They Stick To?"

352
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,080
如果答案是金属  那可能不够开创性
If the answer is "Metal," It's not exactly groundbreaking.

353
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,260
原来的名字是  "再推导
The original title was "A Rederivation

354
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,470
马克斯韦尔的电磁学方程式"
of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism."

355
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,540
我弃用了那个名字
I dumbed it down

356
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,560
因为当时我家乡有些信教的人
because some of the more religious people in town

357
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
开始说我是个巫婆
were starting to say I was a witch.

358
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,440
谢尔顿认为这篇论文里的算法可能会改变
Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way

359
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,890
我们计算磁滞的方法
we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.

360
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,550
也是时候了  我讨厌以前的算法
Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way.

361
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,740
-你好  我是佩妮  -我叫艾利克斯
- Hi. I'm Penny. - Alex.

362
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,610
你与霍夫斯塔德博士共事吗
Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?

363
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,990
在某些方面
In a way.

364
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,160
我们之间有五年长的一系列实验关系
We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.

365
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,900
你真幸运  他非常有才华
Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented.

366
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,130
我肯定很多人想与他共事
And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.

367
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,810
很多人没份儿
Well, a lot of people can't.

368
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,130
来吧
Come on.

369
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,490
去哪里
Where are we going?

370
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,060
我的边缘系统想脱掉你的裤子
My limbic system wants to take your pants off.

371
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,610
她人挺好的
She seems nice.

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,170
用你自己的时间观察他人  我们正工作呢
Notice people on your own time. We're working.

373
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,660
华仔  感觉还好吗
Hey, Howie, how you feeling?

374
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,500
好些了  好多了
Better. Much better.

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,690
其他的宇航员按住我
The other astronauts held me down,

376
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,360
给我来了一针
gave me a shot.

377
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,290
注意  地球人
Attention, people of Earth:

378
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,640
今晚  夜空上会有两个月亮
Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.

379
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,110
华仔  别这样
Howie, stop that.

380
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,330
太空署看着呢
NASA's watching this!

381
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,400
把裤子穿上
Put your pants back on!
