1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,960
《生活大爆炸》  前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,840
我们现在正式宣布你们成为夫妻
We now pronounce you husband and wife!

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050
我爱死这部分了
I love this part!

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,650
我也爱
Me, too!

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,390
我内心五味杂陈啊
I have strongly mixed feelings!

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,920
霍华德真的上太空啦
So, Howard's really in space, huh?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,820
对啊  在国际太空站呢
Mm-hmm, International Space Station.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,990
在我们头上250英里外
250 miles that way.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,720
此时此刻  霍华德正从上方俯视这星球
Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,250
像一个小版的犹太希腊神
like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,320
沃罗威宙斯
Zeusowitz.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,680
我不得不承认
I must admit,

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,180
我心里实在是有点小嫉妒
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,650
他只需往窗外一看
He can look out the window

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,850
壮丽宏伟的宇宙
and see the majesty of the universe

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,950
便尽收眼底
unfolding before his eyes.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,450
尽收他那浑浊愚昧的眼底
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,810
就像放在机场宠物运输箱里的猫
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,480
其实在太空也没这么好啦
You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,930
宇航员所喝的水
The water that the astronauts drink

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,430
都是过滤其他宇航员的尿得来的
is made from each other's recycled urine.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,210
感觉一定不错
Must be nice.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,950
我身上排出的各种液体都没人想要
Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,950
真好奇此时此刻他在太空干嘛
I wonder what he's doing right this very second.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,670
在零重力的状态下做实验
Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,140
透过望远镜看着宇宙的生成
Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,650
无论是什么  他的生活再也不同了
Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,710
霍华德  你听得到我吗
Howard! Can you hear me?!

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,410
不用打电话我都能听到你在地球吼
I can hear you without the phone!

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,810
别这么暴躁
Don't be snippy.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,370
我只是很兴奋能跟我小宝贝说话
I'm just excited to talk to my baby!

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,070
我也很兴奋啊
I'm excited to talk to you, too.

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,810
有个疯狂的谣言说你要搬走
So, what's this mishegas about you moving out

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,690
去跟那个波兰妞同居是怎么回事
to go live with the little Polish girl?!

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,880
你就不能称呼她为我老婆吗
How about calling her my wife?

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,510
老婆才不会害人家母子分离
Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,390
就是因为她们会  所以才要娶她们
They do. That's why we marry them!

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,440
我只希望在你回来之前
I just hope I'm not dead from a broken heart

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,110
我没有心碎而亡
before you get back.

40
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,670
妈  别这样
Ma, please.

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,910
太空总署的人都在听我们讲电话
Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.

42
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,510
很好  这样他们就知道你有多不孝了
Good. They should know what a horrible son you are!

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,630
好啦  妈  下次再聊  挂啦
Okay, Ma, great talking to you! Gotta go!

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,230
太空之旅  被毁得一干二净
Well... space is ruined.

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,200
生活大爆炸 第六季第一集

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,370
好兴奋哦
This is so exciting.

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,060
我唇上的汗毛很快会跟我美丽好友一样
Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,740
有着好看的假金色了
as my beautiful best friend.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,580
我天生就是这个色
Hey, this is my natural hair color.

50
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,000
好吧  现在
Now.

51
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,140
谢尔顿有替你们俩明晚
So, does Sheldon have anything special

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,770
做什么特殊安排吗
planned for you tomorrow night?

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,580
当然有  根据恋爱协议
Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement,

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,330
我们的首次约会周年纪念日
on the anniversary of our first date,

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,880
他得带我去吃顿好的
he must take me to a nice dinner,

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,130
关心我那天的生活琐事
ask about my day

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,120
然后对我做出一些肢体接触
and engage in casual physical contact

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,740
是让旁观者都觉得我们很亲密的那种哦
that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,370
香艳火辣啊
That's hot.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,690
记得使用"防护措施"哦
You kids better use protection.

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,920
这得等多久
How long does this stay on?

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
就几分钟吧
Just a couple of minutes.

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,570
你以前没试过染汗毛吗
You've really never done this before?

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,870
高中时候试过一次  后来打盹
Once in high school, but I dozed off

65
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,570
醒来之后  我脸上就二级化学灼伤了
and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.

66
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,040
天啊  那也太惨了吧
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,470
其他同学有取笑你吗
The other kids make fun of you?

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,650
没有  我编了借口
No, I had a cover story;

69
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,280
我说那是疱疹[性病]
I told everyone it was herpes.

70
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,390
那你跟莱纳德一切如何啊
So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?

71
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,510
不知道  还是有点怪
I don't know, it's still kind of weird.

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,820
他上次的做爱中乱求婚的事
We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,110
我们还没缓过来
in the middle of sex.

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,980
你倒好
Oh. Boo-hoo.

75
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,770
要是谢尔顿在我们做爱的时候求婚
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex,

76
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,860
我的子宫一定会紧紧夹住他那里
my ovaries would grab on to him

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,260
不放他走
and never let go.

78
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,850
莱纳德  你同不同意人择原理
Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

79
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,890
这问题有意思
Interesting question.

80
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,220
一方面来说  我一直...
On the one hand, I always thought...

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,550
你根本就不知道那是什么  对吧
You don't even know what it is, do you?

82
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,930
人择原理指出如果我们想解释
The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,220
为何宇宙是我们看到的这种样子
why our universe exists the way it does,

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,070
那会是因为它必须像现在这样
the answer is that it must have qualities

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,540
演化出能问出这道问题的智慧生物
that allow intelligent creatures to arise

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,680
才会有这个问题的出现
who are capable of asking the question.

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,980
而我现在就正问着这问题呢
As I am doing so eloquently right now.

88
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,710
我知道人择原理是什么
I know what the anthropic principle is.

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
当然啊  我刚给你解释完
Of course. I just explained it to you.

90
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,210
那你是同意还是反对呢
Now, where do you stand on it?

91
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,360
-你同意吗  -非常同意
- Where do you stand on it? - Strongly pro.

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,090
那我就相信是神花了六天创世
Then I believe that God created the world in six days,

93
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,580
然后在第七天  造了你来烦我
and on the seventh, he made you to annoy me.

94
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,310
你们俩好啊
Hey, guys.

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,390
对了  拉杰
Yeah, wait, Raj,

96
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,760
你同不同意人择原理呢
where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,860
-完全同意  -好孩子
- I'm all for it. - Attaboy!

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,190
等等  为什么你觉得他懂
Well, hang on. Why do you believe

99
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,970
而我不懂什么是人择原理呢
that he knows what it is and I don't?

100
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,640
莱纳德  还是别了吧
Oh, Leonard. Let's not take a saw

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,240
这说出来多伤感情啊
to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?

102
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,560
你们俩如果今晚有空
Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight,

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,900
我听说有家SPA  你可以一边泡脚
I heard about a SPA where you soak your feet

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,460
水里还会有小鱼
in a pool full of little fish

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,470
帮你吃掉你脚上的死皮哦
that eat all the dead skin right off them.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,760
不用我说你们也知道  在洛杉矶
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles,

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
全年都是拖鞋季
sandal season is year round.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,470
-其实我跟佩妮有约了  -好吧
- Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny. - Oh, okay.

109
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,210
那就剩咱俩去了  谢尔顿
Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon.

110
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,680
一起去让小鱼帮我们打磨一下脚吧
How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?

111
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,540
我说过无数次了
As I've stated before on numerous occasions,

112
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,560
我唯一能接受被它吃掉的海洋生物
the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,790
就是北海巨妖
is the Kraken,

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,780
因为我死前听到的最后一句话是
because the last words I would hear are:

115
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,420
"放北海巨妖"[电影《诸神之战》台词]
"Release the Kraken."

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,850
这句话百听不厌
That never gets old.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
"放北海巨妖"
"Release the Kraken!"

118
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,930
好怕怕哟
Oh, chills.

119
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,540
再说了  我要跟艾米吃晚餐
Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.

120
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,270
好吧  那我回家一个人待着好了
Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.

121
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,370
这样也蛮好
W-Which is cool.

122
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,520
我一个人吃  一个人睡  一个人默默流泪
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...

123
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,750
蛮好
Cool.

124
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,010
真可惜
Darn.

125
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,690
如果你不忙  我还想请你跟我们一起晚餐呢
If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.

126
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,420
真的吗  我可以去吗  谢谢
Really? I can come? Thanks!

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,690
谢尔顿  你跟艾米的约会之夜
Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj

128
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,910
你确定要带拉杰去吗
on your date night with Amy?

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,710
当然
Oh, absolutely.

130
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,250
根据契约规定  我得跟艾米聊天
I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation

131
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,160
并有肢体接触
and casual physical contact,

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,890
但是没有地方明确指出
but nowhere is it specified

133
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,040
我不能把这项义务外包给印度人
that I can't outsource that to an Indian.

134
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,230
华仔
Howie?

135
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,090
华仔
Howie?

136
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,190
我美丽的新娘子
Hey, there's my beautiful bride!

137
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,160
你可以看见我吗
Can you see me?

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,660
可以  你还好吗
I can. How are you?

139
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,050
棒极了
I'm amazing.

140
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,450
而且是比我梦想中的还要棒
I mean, this is even better than I dreamed.

141
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,180
当我看出窗外  一切都是那么难以置信
I look out the window, and... it's all so unbelievable.

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,550
那就好
Good for you.

143
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,970
我刚跟你妈吃了一顿没完没了的晚餐
I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.

144
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,200
是吗  那不错啊
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

145
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,910
一开始还不错  直到我发现你没告诉她
It was. Until I found out you never told her

146
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,400
我们要搬出去住
we're not gonna live with her.

147
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,240
咱们来好好聊聊这件事吧
Let's talk about that for a minute.

148
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,730
快看  这根笔在飘浮耶
Hey, look, this pen is floating.

149
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
很不可思议吧
How crazy is that?

150
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,670
你说过会告诉她  可你没有
You said you told her, but you never did!

151
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,990
好吧  我知道你很失望  可...
Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but...

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,610
不如我跟你分享下  我来这学到的道理吧
let me share something I've learned since I got here.

153
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,850
当你从太空中往下看地球时
You realize how small your problems are

154
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,040
你会意识到自己的难题  根本微不足道
when you're looking down on them from space.

155
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,190
拜托  听完之后应该开心点了吧
Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,360
你在屏幕上看我有多清晰呀
How clear is the image of me on that screen?

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,890
蛮清晰的
Pretty clear.

158
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,460
我看起来像有开心点吗
Do I look like I feel better?

159
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,080
也没有到高清画质啦
I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.

160
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,540
你给我听好了  快去跟你妈妈说
Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother

161
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,780
把这件事给老娘处理好  不然之前答应你
and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said

162
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,860
你一回家就给你的"服务"
I was gonna do to you the minute you got home,

163
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,000
你就准备"自己来"吧
you can do to yourself.

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,680
打从他上太空  就没少"来"过
Like he's been doing since he got here.

165
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,470
谢尔顿  这地方好浪漫啊
Sheldon, this place is so romantic.

166
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,090
很高兴你喜欢
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

167
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,480
是拉杰选的
Raj picked it out.

168
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,520
你下次看见他  帮我说声谢谢
Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.

169
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
你可以自己跟他说
Tell him yourself.

170
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,750
这边这边
Over here!

171
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,110
我不懂  他在这里干嘛
I don't understand. What's he doing here?

172
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,220
是我邀请他的
I invited him.

173
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,440
来当电灯泡吗
On our date?

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,220
谢尔顿  这样属于违约
Sheldon, that's not okay.

175
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,780
才没有
Yes, it is.

176
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,920
我们的恋爱协议有个漏洞
There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,690
你居然发现了个漏洞
You found a loophole?

178
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,330
抱歉我先点了  我有点小紧张
Sorry I started without you. I'm a little nervous.

179
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
我很久没约过会了
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,940
真不敢相信我居然为了今天  漂白了胡子
I can't believe I bleached my mustache for this.

181
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,180
你应该找我那个美容师
You should go to my girl.

182
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
她还能免费帮你把鬓脚修掉
She'll knock out those sideburns for free.

183
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,720
艾米  我觉得
You know, Amy, I don't even think

184
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,990
我们俩都没好好聊过
you and I have had a real conversation.

185
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,320
不如今晚就让我们加深对彼此的了解吧
Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better.

186
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,170
你先开始
You start.

187
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,170
滚回家
Go home.

188
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,980
我没听懂
I don't understand.

189
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,220
谢尔顿  你怎么能这样呢
Sheldon, how could you do this?

190
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,980
这是我们的两周年纪念日
It's our second anniversary.

191
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,900
今天是你们的纪念日啊
It's your anniversary?!

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,830
天啊  我真的不知道
Oh, my God, I had no idea.

193
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,480
艾米  拜托让我将功补过
Amy, please, let me make this right.

194
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,100
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,430
这是我的荣幸  服务员
My pleasure. Waiter?

196
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,260
香槟一瓶  杯子三个
A bottle of champagne and three glasses.

197
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,130
天啊  这是不是很浪漫呀
Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?

198
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,790
我希望这是个反问句
Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question,

199
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,960
因为我真不知道浪不浪漫
because I have no clue.

200
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,270
真棒  今天是什么日子
This is great. What's the occasion?

201
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,520
什么都不是
No occasion.

202
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,790
你也知道  我们最近关系有点怪怪的
You know, things have been a little weird between us,

203
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,530
所以我想为你准备一个开心的夜晚
so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.

204
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,620
-太贴心了  -我准备了你爱吃的
- That is so sweet. - I got all your favorites.

205
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,720
啤酒  鸡翅  小汉堡
Beer, wings, sliders.

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,350
我们可以看橄榄球比赛
We can watch the football game.

207
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,270
我还在我肚皮上写字了呢
I even painted my stomach.

208
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,010
"体育万岁"
"Go sports"?

209
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,440
以防你突然想换成看棒球
in case you were in the mood for baseball,

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
这样我什么球赛都可以加油到
I didn't want to look ridiculous.

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
这太棒了  我超喜欢的
This is awesome. I love it!

212
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
你开心我也开心
Good, I'm glad.

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
天啊  我今天累死了
Gosh, I worked my ass off today.

214
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
正好需要轻松一下
This is exactly what I needed.

215
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,630
太棒了  那放松享受吧
Great. Just relax and enjoy.

216
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,970
今晚你就是主角
Tonight is all about you.

217
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,600
谢谢你
Ah, thank you!

218
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,110
所以我俩之间的关系到底算是什么状况
So, where exactly are we in this relationship?

219
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
唉  你又来了
Oh, come on!

220
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,220
我刚跟你说了今天很累
I just told you I had a hard day.

221
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,970
对对  我错了  看球看球
You're right, I'm sorry. Let's watch the game.

222
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,320
对嘛
Great.

223
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,490
但这事拖越久不谈只会变得更尴尬
I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.

224
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,200
亲爱的  我今晚就不能做个幸福小女生吗
Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?

225
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,300
当然可以  你是小女生  我是小男孩
Absolutely. You're the girl, I'm the guy.

226
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,820
那你看球
Now, you watch your football game

227
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,810
-我给你盛碟好吃的  -谢谢
- while I make you a little plate here. - Thank you!

228
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,070
我来开
Oh, I'll get it.

229
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,310
体育万岁
Go sports!

230
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,290
你好哟
Hello-lo-lo.

231
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,000
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
你不是跟谢尔顿和艾米在一起吗
I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy.

233
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,920
本来是的  但这是人家周年纪念
I was, but it's their anniversary

234
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,190
我不想当电灯泡
and I didn't want to be a third wheel,

235
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,500
所以就想着来这儿
so I figured I'd come over here

236
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,540
参合你和佩妮的约会
and hang out with you and Penny on your date.

237
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,400
现在不大方便
Well, it's not really a great time.

238
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,330
佩妮和我要谈些事情
Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.

239
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,210
才不呢  进来吧
No, we don't! Come on in!

240
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,300
真棒
Sweet!

241
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,550
难以置信  我居然为了这个把肚皮上的毛给刮了
I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.

242
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,610
嘿  果麦圈客
Hey, Froot Loops.

243
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,220
有电话找
You got a phone call.

244
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,700
谁啊
Who is it?

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,400
说是你妈
A woman who says she's your mother

246
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,820
听像你爸
but sounds like your father.

247
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,600
妈
Hey, Ma.

248
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,670
如果你把电脑打开的话
You know, we could see each other

249
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,600
我们其实可以看到对方的
if you turn on the computer.

250
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,930
我才不会接近那坨垃圾呢
I'm not going near that fakakta thing.

251
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,470
我会感染电脑病毒的
I'll catch a computer virus!

252
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,950
你是不会感染电脑病毒的
You can't catch a computer virus.

253
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,800
所以你现在既是宇航员还是医生了吗
Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?

254
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,090
你想说啥啊  妈
What do you want, Ma?

255
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,900
你老婆说你有重要事情告诉我
Your wife says you have something important to tell me.

256
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,740
好吧  是这样
Okay, here it is.

257
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,200
伯纳黛特和我要开始共同生活  然后
Bernadette and I are starting a life together and...

258
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,150
老天啊  你要弃我而去啦
Oh, God! You are gonna leave me!

259
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,330
妈
Ma...

260
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,670
没关系的
It's okay.

261
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,140
你爸离开我  你也这样
Your father left me, you left me--

262
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,700
我就是那种别人想要抛弃的人
I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.

263
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
这不...还没定呢
It's not... definite.

264
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,300
我会和伯纳黛特商量的
I'll talk to Bernadette.

265
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,470
不用你废心了
Don't bother.

266
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,750
我还是地上挖个坑住着
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,930
死了也省事儿
so I'm no trouble when I die.

268
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,150
别说了  妈
Stop it, Ma.

269
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,900
我肯定能带着小妮妮常回家看看的
I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.

270
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,050
我就知道
I knew it!

271
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,310
她是幕后黑手
I knew she was behind this!

272
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,840
你听着  要当纯爷们儿
You listen to me, if you want to be a man,

273
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,730
你就不能让女人对你指手划脚
you can't let a woman tell you what to do!

274
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,850
好了好了
Okay, okay.

275
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,290
难以置信  这些人居然赢了冷战
I can't believe these people won the Cold War.

276
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,680
现在你能换个话题吗
Now, can we please change the subject?

277
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
好吧
Fine.

278
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,690
那你给我解释解释为啥走了这么久
Explain why you've been gone so long

279
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,770
我没收到过一封信
and I haven't gotten a single letter.

280
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,020
连张便宜明信片都没有
Not even a lousy postcard!

281
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,870
我开始越来越喜欢橄榄球了
You know, I'm growing to like American football.

282
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,880
挺有意思的对吧么
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

283
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,890
虽然没羽毛球或板球这么热血[印度热门运动]
Well...it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket,

284
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,500
不过嘛
but hey...

285
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,210
也不必那么苛求
what is?

286
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,850
好吧  谁还要再来一瓶啤酒
All right, who's ready for another beer?

287
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,420
-我还有  -不用了  谢谢
- I'm good.  - No, thank you.

288
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,970
娘炮
Girls.

289
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,570
这是我最美好的时光
I am having the nicest time.

290
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,700
你们就像我的家人
You guys are like family to me.

291
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,920
你懂的  对吧
You know that, right?

292
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,510
很好  滚吧
That's great. Get out.

293
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,440
为什么
What? Why?

294
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,690
佩妮和我有些事儿需要谈谈
Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.

295
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,920
屁大的事儿啊
Pish on your issues!

296
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,850
你们没问题的
You guys are fine.

297
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,920
没错  你一路上是遇到了点障碍
Yes, you hit some bumps along the way.

298
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,180
还有  佩妮
I mean, Penny,

299
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,120
你也知道这个男人对你的感情
you've always known how this man has felt about you,

300
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,650
但你却总让他祈求你的关爱
but you made him grovel for affection.

301
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,780
等等
Okay, hold on...

302
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,990
别内疚
Now, don't blame yourself.

303
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,290
他从来都是祈求者
He was a groveler from way back.

304
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,690
但我的意思是  你们俩总要跨过去的
But the point is, the two of you got past it.

305
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,490
莱纳德  你滚床单滚一半
And, Leonard, you go and propose

306
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,680
对这可怜的女娃求婚
to this poor girl in the middle of sex?

307
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,320
实在是弱爆了  老兄
That was some weak tea, dude.

308
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,430
有些人也许会觉得浪漫呢
Some people might say it was romantic.

309
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,930
不可能
Yeah, no.

310
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,320
但你看你俩现在还在一起
But yet, here you two are, still together.

311
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,500
甚至还是在我俩激情一裸的那晚之后
And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,750
够了够了
Okay... That's enough.

313
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,290
我是说
I'm just saying

314
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,020
在你俩同甘共苦这么久之后
that after everything you've been through,

315
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,150
总能互相凝望
you get to look into each other's eyes

316
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,820
说声"我爱你"
and say "I love you."

317
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,850
这是多么的美好
And that's beautiful.

318
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,900
事实上到现在为止她还没说过
Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.

319
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,370
佩妮  这太荒谬了
Oh, Penny! That's ridiculous!

320
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,370
你心里知道你爱她的
You know you love him!

321
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,920
你看着他的眼睛然后说出来
You look him in the eyes and you say it.

322
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
-拉杰  -别这样
- Raj...  - Oh, come on,

323
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,000
你知道你想说的  说出来吧
you know you want to say it. Say it.

324
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,190
说你爱他
Say you love him.

325
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,040
快说啊
Say it!

326
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,360
我真以为她一定会说呢
I really thought she would say it.

327
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,450
我有没有跟你说过你像性感的螳螂
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?

328
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,570
每次喝了酒你都会说
Every time you drink alcohol.

329
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,650
你知道螳螂的妙处在哪里吗
You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis?

330
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,350
它们会吃掉自己的配偶
They devour their mate.

331
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,150
你意思是...
Your point being?

332
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,750
"甜点"上桌
Dessert is served.

333
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,300
我刚吃完果馅饼呢
I just had cobbler.

334
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,800
知道吗
You know what?

335
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,590
我受够了
I'm done with this.

336
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,550
你去哪里啊
W-Where are you going?

337
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,150
我走人
I'm leaving.

338
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,740
你不能走
You can't leave.

339
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,180
我需要你
I need you.

340
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,220
你需要我吗
You do?

341
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,940
是的
Yes.

342
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,180
你是我的司机
You're my ride.

343
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,890
谢尔顿  你最好真心地说些甜言蜜语
Sheldon, you either say something meaningful

344
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,420
不然咱俩就此结束
and from the heart, or you and I are done.

345
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,490
好吧
All right.

346
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,470
请坐
Please.

347
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,930
艾米
Amy...

348
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,440
当我看着你的双眼
when I look in your eyes

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,650
而你也深情看着我时
and you're looking back in mine,

350
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,540
一切都好像变得特别了
everything feels not quite normal,

351
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,070
因为我
because I feel

352
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,940
感觉自己变得更强大  同时也更软弱
stronger and weaker at the same time.

353
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,850
我感到激情澎湃的同时  也胆战心惊
I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified.

354
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,190
事实是
The truth is,

355
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,130
我不知道自己的真实感觉  但是
I don't know what I feel, except...

356
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,300
我知道自己想做一个怎样的男人
I know what kind of man I want to be.

357
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,650
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

358
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,490
我好感动
that was beautiful.

359
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,650
我也希望有这效果
I should hope so.

360
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,050
这是《蜘蛛侠I》里的经典台词
That's from the first Spider-Man movie.

361
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,650
我受领了
I'll take it.

362
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,890
很好
Good.

363
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,270
现在  咱俩该分摊饭钱了吧
Now, I assume we're splitting the check?

364
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,570
斯图尔特
Hey, Stuart.

365
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,720
来啦  我正准备打烊
Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.

366
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,050
不好意思  我这就走
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.

367
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,010
不用  没事  随便看
No, no. It's okay. Hang out.

368
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,720
这样好吗
You sure?

369
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
没关系  你是今天我这里的头位顾客
Yeah, you're my first customer today.

370
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,350
好的  太好了
All right. Great.

371
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,770
我正准备来点睡前小酒
I'm, uh, having a nightcap.

372
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,280
要一起来一杯吗
You want to join me?

373
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,450
你喝的是什么
What are you drinking?

374
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,450
用楚巴卡马克杯喝咖啡利口酒
Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.

375
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,320
我管这个叫"悲催马天尼"
I call it a sad-tini.

376
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,900
我今晚喝这个正应景  多谢
Perfect for the night I'm having. Thank you.

377
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,150
有人陪着喝酒感觉真好
Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,820
那还用说
Amen to that.

379
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,500
有时候我会往
Sometimes I pour

380
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,340
我家小狗的水碗里倒点霞多丽葡萄酒
a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.

381
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,520
真的假的
You're kidding.

382
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,600
它喝醉了有点难缠  但总比独醉得好
She's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?

383
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,890
干杯
Cheers.

384
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,350
干杯
Cheers.

385
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,120
-来点音乐助兴  -好啊
- A little music? - Sure.

386
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,380
芭沙风情[新派爵士乐]
Bossa nova.

387
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,970
听这个要用耳朵和屁股一起感受
You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.

388
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,380
正是
Mmm.

389
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,990
拉丁风情的音乐里
Something about...

390
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,420
那种调调能让我陶醉到
Latin music just makes me feel like

391
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,500
犹如置身里约热内卢的白沙滩
I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.

392
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,380
没错
Yeah.

393
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,470
艳阳  波涛  娇躯
The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies,

394
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,120
麦色的皮肤  晶莹的汗水
tanned and glistening with sweat.

395
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,970
-我该走了  -不送了
- I should go. - Yeah.

396
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,120
谢谢你请我喝酒
Uh, thank you for the drink.

397
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,620
甭客气
No problem.

398
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,460
-斯图尔特  -啥事儿
- Hey, Stuart. - Yeah?

399
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,690
你想不想  明晚咱们出去玩玩
Do you want to... hang out tomorrow night,

400
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,350
一起吃个饭  看个晚场电影什么的
maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?

401
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,180
我很乐意  但我手头有点紧
Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.

402
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,700
没事  我请客
No problem. My treat.

403
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,290
我下班后过来
I'll swing by after work.

404
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,580
好的
Okay.

405
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,220
说定了
Okay.

406
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,930
我还能更没下限一点
I could do worse.

407
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,950
这真是个好消息  华仔
Aw, that's such good news, Howie.

408
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,130
多谢你告诉她
Thank you for telling her.

409
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,260
我可是男子汉  当然得跟老婆一起住了
Hey, I'm a grown man; I'm gonna live with my wife.

410
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,980
我老妈只能学着接受一个人过日子了
My mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.

411
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,770
她生气了吗
Was she upset?

412
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,140
谁知道啊  怒吼是她的正常语气
Who can tell? She yells everything.

413
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,960
她可能生气了
She might have been upset.

414
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,590
