1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,750
不是吧
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,460
佩妮  你是不是又用我们的
Penny, have you been recording shows

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,580
-硬盘录像机录节目  -没有啊
- on our DVR again? - No.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,500
说实话就行了  这又不是在审问你
Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,380
之后才会审问
That'll come later.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,140
我绝对没有
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,010
快帮帮我  我不能再被他记过了
Help me out here. I can't afford another demerit.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,270
行
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,580
我们可能是被黑客攻击了呢
Uh... maybe we were hacked.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,550
中国那边最近不是在到处网络攻击吗
You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,520
他们为啥要黑我们的录像机来录《百货战警》
Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,100
我也不知道
I don't know.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,370
看胖子骑电动代步车  哪国人都会觉得好笑
It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,170
我要把它删了
I'm deleting it.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,460
先别删啊
Well, hang on.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,460
那中国黑客可能还没看完呢
Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,520
如果录像机空间不够  要删东西
You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR,

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,360
你怎么不把那些
why don't you just get rid of

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,840
你看过的影片给删了啊
some of the stuff you've already watched?

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,760
比如《阿尔法战士》
Like, um... Alphas.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,530
不行  这是它的第二季季末集呢
No, that's the season two finale.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,740
最后留了个大悬念
That was quite the cliffhanger.

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,010
第三季开始前我要再温习一遍剧情
I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,860
不会有第三季  这剧被砍了
There is no season three. They canceled that show.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
他们不能砍这个剧
Well, they can't cancel it.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,650
季末留了大悬念呢
It ended on a cliffhanger.

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,470
-他们就是砍了  -谢尔顿
- They did. - Uh, Sheldon,

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,200
还剩两个水饺  你要吃吗
there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,970
还水饺
Dumplings?

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,530
你没懂现在情况多严重吗
Don't you understand what's going on here?

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,530
想也知道  没懂
As a rule, no.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,670
这剧季末剧情演到  全纽约居民
That show ended with all the residents of New York

33
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,420
全死或是全昏迷了
either dead or unconscious.

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,340
现在我没机会知道后续发展了
Now I'll never know what happened.

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,490
你怎么不自己编个后续出来呢
Well, why don't you make up your own ending?

36
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,860
行啊  这主意太棒了
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,360
我编完之后
And after that,

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,490
干脆再自编个口腔卫生规矩好了
I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene.

39
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,890
例如以后再也不剔牙  而是把布丁涂牙龈上
You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums.

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,660
我要找出科幻台的电话
I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,770
给他们点教训
and give them what for.

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,420
求你了  别这样
Oh, please, don't do that.

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,930
一定要  他们怎么能砍了这样的剧呢
No. They can't just cancel a show like Alphas.

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,770
他们应该帮助观众放手才对啊
You know? They have to help the viewers let go.

45
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,120
《萤火虫》出了电影版来收尾
Firefly did a movie to wrap things up.

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,220
《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》以漫画继续延伸了下去
Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book.

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,540
《英雄》的剧情一季比一季烂
Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season

48
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,350
到结尾时  观众还感到庆幸呢
till we were grateful it ended.

49
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,950
我替要接到他电话的人感到难过
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,040
不需要
Ah, don't.

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,980
要是不想接到疯狂宅男粉的斥责电话
If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds,

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,290
那他们当初就不应该开这个科幻台
they shouldn't have started a Sci-Fi channel.

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,030
生活大爆炸 第六季  第二十一集

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,610
你之后一定会对这个摄像头
I think you're gonna be really happy

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,880
感到十分满意
with this security camera.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,990
镜头很棒
The optics are great,

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,830
还有内置红外线技术
it's got infrared technology,

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,230
而且还附带备用电池  停电时也能运作
and there's even a backup battery when the power goes out.

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,800
都行啦
Whatever.

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,070
反正我能在上班时
I can see my little princess

61
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,790
看到我的小公主  对吧
while I'm at work, right?

62
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,260
你不能像个正常男人那样上班偷看黄片吗
Why can't you just watch porn like a regular guy?

63
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,930
把你的电脑给我  我得调试下软件
I need your laptop so I can configure the software.

64
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,480
等等
Wait, hold on.

65
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,000
奇了怪了
This is weird.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,690
怎么了
What?

67
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,480
我刚在网上搜我对象的资料
I was Googling that girl I've been dating,

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,670
然后找到了她的博客
and I found her blog.

69
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,810
厉害
Cool.

70
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,010
有"有料"的内容吗
Anything juicy?

71
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,970
她说最近在跟一个叫罗杰的人约会
She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger?

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,030
他还是印度人
And he's Indian?

73
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,630
而且他也是个天体物理学家
And he's an astrophysicist, too?

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,990
你知道这是怎么回事吧
You know what's going on, don't you?

75
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,180
没错  我妈说得太对了
Yes. Mummy was right.

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,460
美国的女人全都是淫荡饥渴骚货
American girls are sexually voracious devils.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,900
没想到我居然得跟你解释这事
I can't believe I have to explain this.

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,380
很多人都会在博客上用假名来保持隐私
People change names on blogs to protect their privacy.

79
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,280
罗杰就是拉杰
Roger is Raj.

80
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,090
我一直以为  如果我要有个白人名
I always thought, if I had a white name,

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,810
那我会叫盖伦
it would be Gavin.

82
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,900
继续读啊  看她都说了啥
Keep reading. What does it say?

83
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,620
不行不行  这不太好吧
No, no, I don't know if I should.

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,030
如果她想我知道她有博客  早就告诉我了
If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me.

85
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,750
这就跟偷看她日记一样
It's almost like I'm reading her diary.

86
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,500
这就是偷看她日记啊  继续读
That's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,510
不行  这太没节操了
No, this is creepy.

88
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,970
从我帮你安装好摄像头的那一刻起
Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror

89
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,770
节操就已成路人了
when I put up that camera.

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,910
我们正常得很  别听他瞎说
It's not creepy. Don't listen to him.

91
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,570
瞧呀  哪个小姑娘的亲亲这么香啊
Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.

92
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,080
要让你们独处吗
Should I go?

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,110
在听完谢尔顿说了这么多电视剧后
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,

94
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,870
我有了一个绝妙的好主意
I had the greatest idea ever.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,990
比我要开名为
It even blows away my idea

96
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,370
"楚巴咖啡厅"星战主题咖啡厅的主意还棒
for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called "Brewbacca's."
楚巴卡是星球大战里的知名角色

97
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,740
那就是让你看《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》
You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,560
这剧超适合我们情侣一同观赏
It is the perfect show for the two of us.

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,030
集火爆动作与搞笑一体
It's got action and jokes

100
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,840
有性感吸血鬼加浪漫爱情  怎么夸都不过分
and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this!

101
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,240
你怎么说
What do you say?

102
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,860
现在是清晨六点半
It's 6:30 in the morning.

103
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,520
你不是在农场长大的吗
I thought you grew up on a farm.

104
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,640
你好  科幻台吗
Hello, SyFy Network?

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,940
我是你们的节目安排副总裁
Yeah, this is your vice president of programming.

106
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,670
对于《阿尔法战士》  我们做了重大错误决定
Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas.

107
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,500
我们要立刻反取消节目
Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately.

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,920
总之谁负责这个  你就把电话转给谁
Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that,

109
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,050
告诉他们我是谁
you tell them it's me,

110
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,860
我不想回答一大堆关于
and I don't want to answer a lot of questions

111
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,890
我是不是真是我自己所说的这个人的问题
about if I really am who I say I am, you know?

112
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,880
我就是要把这事儿解决了
I just... I want this done.

113
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,460
不  我不是刚才打来电话的人
No, I am not the person who just called.

114
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,180
那个人很显然是个牛仔
That man was clearly a cowboy.

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,330
对  他只是单纯地关心
Yeah, who was plumb concerned

116
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,570
你们取消了他最喜爱的电视剧
about y'all canceling his favorite show.

117
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,670
他们为什么总是挂我电话
Why do they keep hanging up on me?

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,190
很遗憾你这么难过
I'm sorry you're upset.

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,770
知道吗  谢尔顿  在这种时刻
You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort

120
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,770
有些人会寻求身体接触带来的安慰
of physical contact in moments like this.

121
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,840
我才不会飞回德州
I am not flying back to Texas

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,370
就为了让我妈抱一下
just so my mom can give me a hug.

123
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,290
好吧
Okay.

124
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,190
我觉得你现在的情况是
Well, what I think is going on here

125
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,020
对于"结局"  你有种病态的需求
is you have a pathological need for closure.

126
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,160
真是胡说
Oh, that's nonsense.

127
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,140
你总是告诉我你的日常生活琐碎事
I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time.

128
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
我根本不关心结局是什么
I don't care how they end.

129
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,250
也许我能帮你
You know, I might be able to help you with this.

130
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,390
在行为神经学方面有一个领域
There's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience

131
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,180
研究如何重新训练神经通路
that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways

132
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,240
然后这样的事情便不会如此困扰你了
so stuff like this bothers you less.

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,230
但我刚刚对你说了
Yeah, but I just told you,

134
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,680
我才没纠结要有结局的问题
I don't have a problem with closure.

135
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,830
你确定吗
You sure about that?

136
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,530
相当确定
Oh, quite sure.

137
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,090
这不能证明什么
That proves nothing.

138
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,900
可以去吃午饭了吗
Ready to go to lunch?

139
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,710
你觉得我这人很女性化吗
Do you think I'm feminine?

140
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,830
是的  我们走
Yeah. Let's go.

141
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,930
多谢你了
Thanks a lot.

142
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,440
怎么了
What's going on?

143
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,990
我没忍住  我看了露西的博客
I broke down, and I read Lucy's blog.

144
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,300
其中有一段
And in one of the entries,

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,510
她说  我们初次见面时
she said, when we first met,

146
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,850
她觉得我这人有一点点女性气质
I struck her as a little feminine.

147
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,400
才觉得一点点而已  很好啊
Just a little? That's great.

148
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,870
我得跟她谈谈这个
I have to talk to her about this.

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,610
老天  为什么你们女生总要谈这谈那
Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things?

150
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,000
听我说
Listen to me,

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,590
如果她写了你们感情方面的内容
if she's writing about your relationship,

152
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,320
你就好好利用啊
use it to your advantage.

153
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,060
操纵游戏
Rig the game.

154
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,470
这似乎不公平吧
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

155
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,900
难道女生喜欢自信正常的男生多过
Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys

156
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,280
紧张古怪男  这样就公平吗
more than nervous weirdos?

157
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,440
这不公平
No, it's not.

158
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,690
我一直觉得这不公平
I've always thought that was unfair.

159
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,320
那就利用博客里的内容  让她宽衣解裤带
So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.

160
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,290
为什么话从你的嘴里出来  就这样下流
Why do you have to make everything so filthy?

161
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,190
你为什么不能说博客就像是
Why couldn't you just say the blog is like

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,760
她给了我一把打开她心门的钥匙
her giving me the key to her heart?

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,670
"打开她心门的钥匙"
"The key to her heart."

164
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,790
真不错
That's nice.

165
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,850
这话是你引用别人的
Were you quoting someone

166
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,290
还是你腰上的娘们纹身
or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

167
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,670
我在引用对女人略知一二的男人的话
I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women:

168
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,880
艾尔顿·约翰爵士[著名同性恋歌手]
Sir Elton John.

169
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,880
你喜欢吗
So, did you love it?

170
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,130
你当然喜欢了  你怎么会不喜欢呢
Of course you loved it. How could you not love it?

171
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,020
告诉我你有多喜欢
Tell me how much you loved it.

172
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,780
很可爱
It was cute.

173
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,310
别说可爱啊
Oh, don't say cute.

174
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,460
这个词最差劲了
That's the worst.

175
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,410
可爱怎么不对了
What's wrong with cute?

176
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,630
这样一形容就觉得东西小小的
It just makes things seem small.

177
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,310
有种渺小的感觉
It diminishes them.

178
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,370
你这是要我不再说你的小屁屁可爱吗
So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?

179
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,670
你可以不说啊  不过没人会相信你
You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you.

180
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,390
我只是不理解  为什么看这么优秀的电视剧
I just... I don't understand how you can watch a show that great

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,990
你却一点也不激动
and not be excited by it.

182
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,430
我喜欢  我很激动
I liked it. I'm excited.

183
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,940
那你的表情就配合一下啊
Well, then, tell your face.

184
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,540
你想让我怎么样
What do you want from me?

185
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,660
这样吧
You know what?

186
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,830
算了  我们尝试过了
Never mind. We gave it a shot.

187
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,280
看看有什么其它节目吧
Let's just see what else is on.

188
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,940
拜托  别这样嘛
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

189
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,570
抱歉我说了可爱
I'm sorry I called it cute.

190
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,360
-我们再看一集  -真的吗
- Let's watch another one. - Really?

191
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,500
对  挺有意思的
Yeah, it was fun.

192
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,480
让我想起了高中时代
Kind of reminded me of my high school.

193
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,760
但我们没有吸血鬼  只有嗑药鬼
But instead of vampires, we had meth heads.

194
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,940
但两者都是夜晚冒出来  而且都是一口烂牙
But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.

195
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,750
好吧
All right, cool.

196
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,370
我觉得你会更喜欢下一集
I-I think you'll like the next one better.

197
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,950
讲的是啦啦队员们遭受邪恶诅咒之苦
All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.

198
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,320
这点也很像高中
Oh. Well, that's like my high school, too.

199
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,480
不过不是诅咒  是阴虱之苦
But instead of a curse, it was crabs.

200
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,530
我准备了一系列练习
I've come up with a series of exercises

201
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,310
帮你克服对收尾的强迫需求
to help with your compulsive need for closure.

202
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,450
我不喜欢"强迫"这个词
I take issue with the word "compulsive."

203
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,640
我的意思是
All I'm saying is,

204
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,700
我们生活的这个世界里  结局并不是一定...
we live in a world where closure isn't always an op...

205
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,860
会有的  好吧
...Tion. Okay.

206
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,300
为了论证这点  就先假设我是有问题
For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem.

207
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,670
那你要如何证明我有问题呢
What would be your plan for addressing it?

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,980
我要重建你的大脑思路
I'm going to recondition your brain

209
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,690
让这种对结局的需求得以抑制
so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.

210
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,360
靠玩井字游戏吗
By playing tic-tac-toe?

211
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,660
对  该你了
Yep. Your turn.

212
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,530
艾米
Oh, Amy.

213
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,820
你现在知道为什么人们认为神经学
And you wonder why people think neuroscience

214
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,670
不过是小儿科的愚蠢游戏了吧
is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies.

215
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,170
井字游戏肯定会有赢  输  或平手的结局
Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw...

216
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,910
完全没办法阻止我得到结局的乐趣
none of which will deny me closure.

217
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,960
特别是我即将胜出的情况下
Especially since I'm about to win.

218
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,430
我们还没玩完呢
B-But we didn't finish.

219
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,420
正是
Exactly.

220
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,720
你对此有何感觉
How does that make you feel?

221
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,370
跟任何正常人一样啊
The same way any normal person would.

222
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,460
我想扯掉自己的脸
Feel like I want to peel off my own face

223
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,300
撕成两半  然后不停地撕
and tear it in two and then again and again

224
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,870
直到我的脸碎成渣
until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.

225
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,800
今日的治疗针对的
And that's exactly the feeling we want to address

226
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,790
正是这种感觉
with this course of treatment.

227
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,810
或者你可以帮个忙  抓我的鼻孔
Yeah, or you could pitch in, grab a nostril

228
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,680
帮我把这玩意撕下来
and help me get this face off.

229
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,030
加油啊  你行的
Come on, you can do this.

230
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,680
你不能理解这种闹心的感觉是何滋味
You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated.

231
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,290
心中逐渐建立起了强烈的欲望
To have a-a desire build up within you

232
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,610
最后却只能憋着  无处释放
and be denied any opportunity for release.

233
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,270
听起来是很惨啊
Yeah, sounds like a drag.

234
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,890
帮我分析分析
Okay, help me out here.

235
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,190
他为什么这么喜欢这个剧
Why does he love this show so much?

236
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,080
片中有动作场面  也很搞笑
Well, there was action, it was funny.

237
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,710
你明白通常都是怪物追美女
I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl,

238
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,750
而这里是美女追怪物吧
but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?

239
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,680
耶嘿  反过来啦  我明白
Yippee, it's backwards. I get it.

240
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,510
你为什么这么困扰这事啊
Why does this bother you so much?

241
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,990
不知道
I don't know.

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,350
他总是为这么多东西感到兴奋
It's just, he's so passionate about so many different things.

243
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,790
我就做不到那样
I just don't get that way.

244
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,140
你行吗
Do you?

245
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,030
可以啊  我对科学就很热爱
Well, sure. I'm pretty passionate about science.

246
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,140
我还记得第一次看显微镜下
I remember the first time I looked through a microscope

247
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,620
那无数微生物时的场景
and saw millions of tiny microorganisms.

248
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,850
简直就像另一个宇宙
It was like a whole other universe.

249
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,220
只要姐愿意  就可以像神一样用大拇指按死它们
If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.

250
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
瞧  我也想找点这种热情
See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life.

251
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,270
我也想有特别在乎的东西
I mean, I want to care about things

252
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,030
像你们一样为之兴奋
and get excited like you guys.

253
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,680
你完全可以啊
Well, there's no reason you can't.

254
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,510
你这么认为吗
You think?

255
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,680
当然了  我们需要做的
Absolutely. All we need to do is spend

256
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,940
只是花点时间  找到你所热爱的东西
a little time and find something you're passionate about.

257
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,670
听起来好累啊
That sounds like a lot of work.

258
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,560
怎么啦
Hey, what's up?

259
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,050
露西要来  我需要点建议
Uh, Lucy's coming over. I need some advice.

260
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,050
不管你认为前奏该有多长  加成三倍
However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.

261
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,390
你就说说哪件会更有男子气概吧
Just tell me which one you think is more manly.

262
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,850
曲棍球运动衫还是
This hockey jersey or...

263
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,120
橄榄球运动衫
this football jersey.

264
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,990
我也不知道  穿曲棍球的吧
I don't know. Go with hockey.

265
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,660
很好  黑色显瘦
Good-- black is more slimming.

266
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,610
她来了
Oh, that's her.

267
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,380
我要去当壮汉了  拜拜
I got to go be butch. Toodles.

268
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,620
请进
Come in.

269
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,260
瞧瞧你这可爱的小狗狗
Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.

270
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,900
别离它太近
Yeah, well, I wouldn't get too close.

271
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,230
如果我用德语给她下个命令
If I give the right command in German,

272
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,160
她就会把你的脸撕下来
she'll rip your face off.

273
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,200
* 在这自由国家 *
* O'er the land of the free *
美国国歌

274
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,290
* 勇士的... *
* And the home of the... *
完整歌词是"勇士的家乡"

275
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,720
下一个
Next.

276
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,690
这设计可真不错  对吗
That's quite an impressive layout, isn't it?

277
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
是的
Yes.

278
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,060
收起来吧
Let's box it up.

279
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,960
收起来吧
"Let's box it up."

280
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,200
够了
That's enough.

281
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,130
谢尔顿  谢尔顿  给我
Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!

282
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,230
好了  谢尔顿  许个愿然后吹蜡烛吧
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles.

283
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,650
惨了  漏了一支
Oops, missed one.

284
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,700
现在你的愿望不能实现了
Now your wish can't come true.

285
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,530
你真幸运  我许的愿是你死了
Lucky for you, 'cause I wished you were dead.

286
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,230
我喜欢你的运动衫
I like your jersey.

287
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,220
谢谢夸奖  我喜欢曲棍球
Thanks. I love hockey.

288
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,820
真不错  我爸爸也喜欢
Oh, cool. So does my dad.

289
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,850
我从小就和他一起看比赛
We watched it all the time growing up.

290
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,790
你最喜欢的球员是谁
Who's your favorite player?

291
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,510
不是布莱恩·博伊塔诺就是了[美国花样滑冰冠军]
Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure.

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,800
你的玉米饼好吃吗
How's your burrito?

293
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,880
这饼中间还有点没化冻呢
It's still a little frozen in the middle.

294
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,770
那是因为我没有读说明书的缘故
Probably because I didn't read the instructions.

295
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,400
我从来不看包装纸上的说明[饶舌歌手]
No wrapper's going to tell me what to do.

296
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,300
除非上面写的是杰斯的饶舌
Unless his name is Jay-Z.

297
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,910
你有什么事吗
Is something going on?

298
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,880
此话怎讲
What do you mean?

299
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,670
你表现一直怪怪的
Well, you're acting all weird.

300
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,350
我自己本身就够怪的了
And I'm pretty weird,

301
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,930
连我觉得怪  那可是真的怪
so I think I know what I'm talking about.

302
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,350
我也不知道  或许是因为我最近吃的类固醇吧
I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.

303
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,940
我看我还是走吧
I think I'm gonna go.

304
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,620
谢谢你的玉米饼  煎猪皮
Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds

305
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,630
还有足足20分钟的
and the 20-minute lecture

306
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,790
关于为什么怪物卡车比普通卡车强的讲座
on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.

307
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,510
等等  等一下
Wait, wait.

308
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,160
我看到你写的关于我的博客了
I-I found your blog where you wrote about me.

309
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,730
我那是写给我自己看的
Oh. I kind of just write that for myself.

310
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,390
我没想过会有人真来读
I didn't think anybody actually read it.

311
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,210
那倒是  你藏的还挺隐秘的
No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find.

312
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,800
我上网找了好久才找到呢
I spent hours digging around online.

313
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,030
顺带一提  你的信用记录挺好的
For the record, you have excellent credit scores.

314
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,560
还有你那个得糖尿病的阿姨
And your diabetic aunt seems

315
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,080
看起来也挺适应她那条新腿的
to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.

316
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,290
你今天怎么表现得这么奇怪呢
Why were you acting so strange tonight?

317
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,110
你说我这人太女性化了
You called me feminine.

318
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,250
所以我
And I...

319
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,850
我想在你面前表现得阳刚一点
I wanted you to think I was more manly.

320
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,610
拉杰  我说的女性化并不是坏事
Raj, I didn't say "feminine" was a bad thing.

321
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,810
我是指你又贴心又善解人意
I meant that you're sweet and thoughtful

322
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,350
还有你的皮肤就像焦糖
and your skin looks so much like caramel,

323
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,970
让我想用苹果沾着吃
I just want to dip an apple in your face.

324
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,640
我的确有一套超棒的
I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall

325
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,730
在保湿秘方
moisturizing regimen.

326
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,060
所以  你没事吧
So, are you okay?

327
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,280
没事
Yeah.

328
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,610
那就好
Good.

329
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,670
那你真的喜欢冰球吗
Do you even like hockey?

330
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,020
当然不
No.

331
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,330
这套衣服是我去斯台普斯球馆
Bought this at the Staples Center

332
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,460
看泰勒·斯威夫特演唱会时买的
when I went to see Taylor Swift.

333
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,280
我思考了一下你总是为
So, I was thinking how excited you get

334
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,870
吸血鬼猎人巴菲呀  科学呀
about stuff like Buffy or science

335
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,290
或你和谢尔顿为了买哪个遥控器而激动吵架
or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.

336
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,860
"和谐一号"已经很不错了
The "Harmony One" was fine.

337
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,410
根本没必要升级到1100型
We didn't need to upgrade to the 1100,

338
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,440
他知道我手太小拿不了那个型号的
which he knows is too big for my hand.

339
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,630
你看  你这种激情就是我所没有的
See, that's the kind of passion I didn't think I had.

340
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,870
但我后来意识到  我对你本人就有激情
But then I realized I'm passionate about you.

341
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,730
是我的可爱小翘臀起了作用吧
Oh... my cute little tushy strikes again.

342
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,050
不  我是说真的
No, I'm serious.

343
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,770
我一直觉得
Look, I've always had these plans.

344
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,430
我会变成电影明星  过着五光十色的生活
I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life,

345
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,580
而和这些无关的东西
and anything less than that

346
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,680
都不值得我激动
just wasn't worth getting excited about.

347
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,380
你说的那些还是有可能发生的
Those things can still happen.

348
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,700
这一切当然是会发生的
Oh, obviously it's gonna happen.

349
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,620
有个单身派对上的算命师已经帮我算过了
Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so.

350
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,040
但我想说的是
Anyway, what I meant was...

351
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,310
我不该再观望下去了  懂吗
I shouldn't wait, you know?

352
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,870
我有你  我有谢尔顿
I've got you, I've got Sheldon,

353
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,910
这么多超级棒的朋友
all these wonderful friends.

354
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,270
我的生活已经足够精彩了
My life is exciting right now.

355
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,740
这的确很重要
That's a big deal.

356
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,120
的确如此  对不对
It is, isn't it?

357
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,190
这是不是就意味着我们可以开始
So, does that mean we get to do stuff

358
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,650
一起讨论那些好看的电视  或者穿着
like talk about cool shows or get dressed up

359
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,770
情侣变装制服一起去参加漫画大会了
in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?

360
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,300
莱诺德  我只是顿悟  不是突然中风好吗
Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.

361
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,450
艾米  我得说  一开始我是抱着怀疑的态度
Amy, I must say, I was skeptical at first,

362
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,510
但今晚的确是充满改革性的一夜呀
but this has truly been a transformative evening.

363
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,170
你能有如此正面的态度  我还真有点小惊讶
I'm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.

364
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,720
你是个出色的神经学家
Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist,

365
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,150
也是个很棒的女朋友  还是
you're a wonderful girlfriend, and...

366
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,750
还是
And?

367
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,070
这不重要  对吧
Doesn't matter, does it?

368
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,500
我真为你自豪  谢尔顿
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

369
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,840
还是个彻头彻尾的笨蛋
And a complete sucker.

370
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,790
我赢了
Oh, yeah.

371
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,130
出来了
There he is.

372
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,030
* 也是勇气的家乡 *
* And the home of the brave... *

373
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
别停下  继续继续
Don't stop. Yes, keep going.

374
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,450
就是这样  马上就成功了  就要到头了
Just like that. Almost there, almost there.

375
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,370
谢尔顿  你个怪胎
Sheldon, you big weirdo,

376
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,480
我要你知道  我喜欢有你在我身边
I want you to know that I love that you're in my life.

377
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,890
我也喜欢你
I love you, too.

378
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,650
请问  你是阿尔法战士季终集的
Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote

379
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,990
编剧布鲁斯·米勒吗
the season finale of Alphas?

380
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,980
太好了  你已经比前一个
Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer

381
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,790
要我自己跟自己做爱的布鲁斯·米勒
than the last Bruce Miller who suggested

382
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,510
听起来友善多了
I have sexual relations with myself.

383
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,900
好了  现在言归正传
Yeah, now, down to business.

384
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,080
你这剧最后埋下了一个悬念
Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger.

385
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,390
你能告诉我你打算怎么解决它吗
Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it?

386
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,090
我明白了
I see.

387
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,730
这也太烂了吧
Well, that all stinks.

388
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,140
怪不得你这剧被取消了呢  回见
No wonder you got canceled. Bye.
