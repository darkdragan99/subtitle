1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,380
大家好  我是谢尔顿博士
Hello, I am Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,020
节目开始前  我想先公布
Before we get started, I'd like to announce

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,940
设计旗帜比赛的赢家
the winner of our design your own flag competition.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,470
可惜没有
But I can't.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,640
唯一的参赛作品来自网友"爱咪福乐75"
The only entry was from GameyGamer75,

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,000
我知道你上传的是自己屁股照片
and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,360
本周这集十分特别
Now this week we have a very special episode

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,800
我们将介绍
where we explore the flags

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,000
热门影集《星际迷航》中的旗帜
of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,420
我很荣幸请到这位来帮忙的特邀嘉宾
And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,140
网络名人
Internet personality,

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,060
《星际迷航:  下一代》剧中演员
former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,630
并且是我认识的唯一一位有幸被按比例
and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,260
做成小人偶的朋友
in 1/16 scale--

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,850
将激光枪设至欢乐档
set phasers to "Fun"...
改编自《星际迷航》中的句子
"set phasers to stun"[将激光枪设至击晕档]

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,940
欢迎我的好友  威尔·惠顿
...for my friend, Wil Wheaton.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,370
谢尔顿  感谢你的邀请
Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me.

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,360
-很高兴能上贵节目  -停
- I'm happy to be here. - Cut.

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,340
怎么啦
What's wrong?

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,940
谢尔顿  你的表现如往常一样精彩
Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always.

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,750
威尔  你有点太呆板了
Wil, that was a little wooden.

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,700
呆板吗
Wooden?

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,250
别担心  也没那么烂
Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,370
但这次可以像正常人一样说话吗
Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,170
开拍
And action.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,100
我的好友威尔·惠顿
My friend, Wil Wheaton.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,390
谢尔顿  感谢你的邀请
Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me.

29
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,580
我很兴奋能上贵节目呢
I'm excited to be here.

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,370
威尔  你将从哪一面旗帜开始介绍呢
So, Wil, what do you have for us first?

31
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,180
这面旗非常有意思
Well, this is an exciting one.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,710
这是星际联邦的旗帜
This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,750
-这面旗有趣的地方在于...  -停
- Now what's interesting about this flag... - Cut.

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,760
又怎么了
What was wrong with that?

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
这节目叫"有趣"的旗帜
It's called "Fun with Flags."

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,550
不是有人死了在降半旗哀悼
They're not at half-mast, nobody died.

37
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,210
欢乐喜庆点好不好
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,340
我无意冒犯
Um, no offense,

39
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,020
但我从小就开始演戏
but I've been acting since I was a kid.

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,440
上个网络节目
I think I can handle a Web show

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,670
我应该不需要人家教
without a lot of direction.

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,730
此话不假
It's true.

43
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,810
在1982年  威尔就替卡通电影
In 1982, Wil played the voice

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,400
《勇敢鼠妈妈》里的一角配音了
of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,930
你感动了我
You moved me.

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,730
原谅我的吹毛求疵
You'll have to forgive me.

47
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,810
我第一次当导演  只想尽善尽美
This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,270
-我也是  -很好
- So do I. - Great.

49
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,710
那这次就请你
So, this time let's try

50
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,940
像个真男孩  而非小木偶
more real boy, less Pinocchio.

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
开拍
And action.

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,060
停
And cut.

53
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,170
你知道我是无偿友情客串的吧
You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,340
但目前为止  无偿都有点不值回票价呢
Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth.

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,880
再来一次
Let's try it again.

56
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,580
大家开开心心
Everybody's having fun.

57
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,060
开拍
And action.

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,620
威尔
So, Wil...

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,290
你要先介绍哪面旗帜呢
...what do you have for us first?

60
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,850
这面旗十分有意思哦
Well, this is an exciting one.

61
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,350
这面旗
This is the flag

62
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,520
可是星际联邦的旗帜
of the United Federation of Planets.

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,700
停
Cut.

64
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,370
有问题吗  "新手"导演
Problem, first-time director?

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,700
我是没发现啦
Oh, none that I could see.

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,630
我只觉得你跟我一样热爱旗子
I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do.

67
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,660
都起鸡皮疙瘩了
I got goose bumps.

68
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,240
他故意夸张演出
He was overacting on purpose.

69
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,160
真的吗
Really?

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,910
让我想起电影里寇克船长小时候呢
He reminded me of a young William Shatner.

71
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,030
谢尔顿  我很乐意上你节目
Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you,

72
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,380
但她要在这当找茬精的话  那就算了吧
but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
他这么说我  你居然没意见吗
You gonna let him speak to me like that?

74
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,720
这个嘛...
Well...

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,910
你是我女朋友
you're my girlfriend

76
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,920
我不想你不高兴
and I don't want you to be upset.

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,800
但威尔·惠顿也是我朋友
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,110
我也不想他不高兴
and I don't want him to be upset.

79
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,200
真是进退两难啊
This is a sticky wicket.

80
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,070
你有什么看法
What do you think?

81
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,920
我们去一边谈谈
Can I speak to you for a second?

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,710
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,170
欢迎你"自娱自乐"
Feel free to play with yourself.

84
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,620
我不管他是不是你朋友
I don't care for your friend,

85
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,220
他对我出言不逊
he's being rude to me.

86
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,560
你得叫他滚蛋
You need to ask him to leave.

87
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,550
艾米  你怎么能叫他滚蛋呢
Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

88
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,570
他好歹也是个二线明星
He's a minor celebrity.

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,350
只需费点唇舌解释  人们还是能认出他的
Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
行  那我走可以了吧
Fine. Then maybe I should go.

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
真的吗  那问题就能迎刃而解了
Could you? That would solve everything.

92
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,650
你最好了
You are the best.

93
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,590
今晚晚餐见吗
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

94
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,820
你不会想跟你的好友威尔
You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner

95
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,050
一起共进晚餐吗
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

96
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,050
细想一下  我还真想呢
Come to think of it, I would!

97
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,240
小妞你今天棒呆啦
You, little lady, are on fire.

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,240
生活大爆炸 第六季第七集

99
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,870
每次来吃晚饭
Every time we eat dinner here,

100
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,230
你妈妈都不让我帮忙洗碗
your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,010
别往心里去  她想自己洗碗
Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself

102
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,850
单纯是怕被别人看她偷舔碗盘
so she can lick the plates with no one looking.

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,670
准备好要回去了吗
You ready to go?

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,820
行  我拿几件洗好的高领衣就走
Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
咱们家那么多地方  干嘛还要把东西
I don't understand why you keep your stuff here

106
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,620
统统都留在这里啊
when there's plenty of room at home.

107
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,280
哪有这回事
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,210
我就留了几件外套
All I have here is a few sweaters,

109
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,180
书  银行东西  电脑
books, bank stuff, computers,

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,250
信件  收藏品  药物跟电动除毛机
mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer.

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,640
我的格子纹小围脖
Ooh, there's my plaid dickie.

112
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,710
我在二手店花五毛钱买到的呢
Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.

113
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,630
不敢相信吧
Can you believe it?

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,100
感觉就值这个价呀
50 cents sounds right.

115
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,630
走吧
Let's go.

116
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,890
有点晚了呢
You know, it's kinda late.

117
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,490
何不干脆在这里过夜
Why don't we just spend the night here?

118
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,090
因为我们不住在这里啊
Because we don't live here.

119
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,360
我知道
I know.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
你真知道吗  你自己说
Do you? You said when you got back from space

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,890
从太空回来后就搬进我公寓
you were gonna move into my apartment,

122
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,530
但半数时间我们都住这里
but half the time we stay here.

123
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,800
才没有呢
That's not true.

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,710
霍华德  我要洗衣服了
Howard, I'm doing laundry!

125
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,100
有什么需要我帮你洗的吗
You want me to put anything in for you?!

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,030
篮子里有我的内裤  拿去洗吧
There's some underwear in the hamper!

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,500
非常好  我刚好要试试新去渍棒
Oh, good! I got that new stain stick to try out!

128
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,820
谢谢你做我"两周前"要求的事啊
Thank you! I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
好吧  我懂你意思了
Okay, I see what you're getting at.

130
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,700
要不这周末吧
How about this weekend

131
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,820
我把所有东西都打包搬回咱家
I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.

132
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,320
谢谢
Thank you.

133
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,960
这两把光剑放在我们客厅肯定很帅
The lightsabers are gonna look great in the living room.

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,330
放衣柜里也不错  到时候决定吧
Or in the closet. We can decide later.

135
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,090
霍华德  帮帮忙
Howard, help!

136
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,390
我的手卡在食物垃圾处理机里了
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

137
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,130
那你把手里抓着不放的食物放开啊
Let go of whatever piece of food you're holding!

138
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
你不是吧
Are you kidding?!

139
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,880
是一根完好无缺的好鸡腿呢
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

140
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,510
某人像个大男孩一样  夜游晚归哦
Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.

141
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,300
我跟威尔·惠顿去共进晚餐了
I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

142
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,620
再让我们吃个四小时
Four hours more and we would have

143
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,800
就能吃垮"家乡"自助餐厅了
closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

144
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,130
-你不是跟艾米有约了吗  -是啊
- I thought you had plans with Amy. - Yeah, I did,

145
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,020
但威尔说艾米是找茬精
but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

146
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,960
她就不爽走人了
She got huffy and left,

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,780
然后我就跟威尔一起去吃晚饭了
then Wil and I headed out to dinner.

148
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,100
"家乡"自助餐厅  真的有家乡味呢
That place really did remind me of my hometown.

149
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,310
因为我家乡也有一家"家乡"自助餐厅
Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.

150
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,070
等等  威尔跟艾米吵架啦
Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?

151
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,300
对啊  挺剑拔弩张的
Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,320
然后艾米火大走人啦
Then Amy got mad and left?

153
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,090
夺门而出  一去不返
Walked right out the door.

154
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,460
然后你...
And you...?

155
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,700
跟威尔开心地吃了顿好价钱的晚饭
Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price.

156
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,710
餐厅经理认出了威尔
The manager recognized Wil

157
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,400
同意让我们坐在冰酸奶机旁呢
and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine.

158
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,220
正旁边哦
Right next to it!

159
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,170
比我现在跟你的距离还近呢
I was closer to it than I am to you right now.

160
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
兄弟  艾米可能在不高兴哦
Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.

161
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,710
为啥啊
Why's that?

162
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,490
你的朋友对她出言不逊
Because your friend was rude to her,

163
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,700
你还跟他一起去吃晚饭
and then you went to dinner with him.

164
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,820
这不就是我刚才说的而已吗
You're just repeating what I said.

165
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,200
你这只乳糖不耐症的学舌鹦鹉
It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

166
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,610
听我的  打给她吧
Trust me, call her.

167
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,640
行  你没跟我们一起吃晚餐  真可惜
Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us,

168
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,130
因为你等下就只能尝到
because the buffet you're about to enjoy

169
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,930
屈辱的滋味了
only serves humble pie,

170
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,620
跟冰酸奶的味道完全不能比哦
a dessert much less tasty than frozen yogurt.

171
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
当时就坐这么近
I was this close.

172
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,060
有何贵干
What?

173
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,710
跟你说个笑话
You'll appreciate this.

174
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,540
莱纳德脑子抽风  说你在气我
Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me.

175
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,310
告诉他没这回事
Tell him you're not mad at me.

176
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,680
说吧  给他个痛快
Go ahead, set him straight.

177
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,670
我是气你啊  谢尔顿
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,860
吃根巧克力棒吧
Eat one of your Luna bars.

179
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,890
女人常以为自己在愤怒
Very often when women think they're angry,

180
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,680
其实只是肚子饿而已啦
they're really just hungry.

181
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,480
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

182
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,330
你朋友羞辱我  你也不干嘛
Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.

183
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,590
对啊  我什么都没干啊
Precisely, I didn't do anything.

184
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,000
某人是不是该仔细想想自己在说啥啊
Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?

185
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,910
继续吧兄弟  我看好你哦
Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.

186
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,230
谢尔顿  我是你女朋友
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend,

187
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,070
你应该帮我的才对啊
and you should have taken my side.

188
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,300
就这样吧  我说完了  晚安
That's it. End of story. Good night.

189
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,800
哎哟  艾米在生气  莱纳德说得对
Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,710
今天真不可思议
What a weird day.

191
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,290
抱歉  让你们等这么久
Hey. Sorry this took so long.

192
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,280
你以前也在这打工过  你懂得
But you used to work here, you know how it is.

193
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,580
厨房又出事了吗
Kitchen slammed again?

194
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,970
是我只是个烂服务生  忘了吗
No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

195
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
你明天要搬家
So, is there anything I can do

196
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,400
我有什么能帮你的吗
to help you with the move tomorrow?

197
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,740
正好你提到此事
Now that you mention it,

198
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,850
我觉得明天不是一个搬家的好日子
I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

199
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,200
-你又有什么借口了  -没借口
- What's your excuse this time? - No excuse.

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,580
只是呢  我是犹太人嘛  严格来说
It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically,

201
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,420
安息日的时候我们得休息  不适合搬家
we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath.

202
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,380
怪神别怪我啊
So this one's on God.

203
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,030
要想赖神跟习俗可以
That might be a little more convincing

204
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,590
但你满嘴猪肉起司汉堡  谁信啊[犹太人不吃猪肉]
if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,440
我不是一个忠实信徒嘛
My religion's kinda loosey-goosey.

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,510
简单来说  只要乖乖牺牲包皮[割礼]
Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped

207
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,540
不戴十字架也没事啦
and don't wear a cross, you're good.

208
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,470
华仔  你答应过我会搬家的
Howie, you promised you'd move.

209
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,550
我会啊
And I will.

210
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,270
-谁信啊  -我真的会搬
- Yeah, right. - I will.

211
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,510
我怎么可能会一辈子都赖在
I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house

212
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,320
我妈的家里不走呢  又不是小孩
for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.

213
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,550
我见过她帮你拍嗝
I've seen her burp you.

214
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,720
她不是帮我拍饱嗝
She did not burp me.

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,780
只是她拍我的背  我刚好打了个嗝
She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp.

216
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,990
你不用去招待其他客人吗
Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?

217
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,930
要啊  但我也说了  我是个烂服务员
Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job.

218
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,280
伯纳黛特  相信我
Bernadette, listen to me.

219
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,610
他死也不会搬走
He is never gonna leave.

220
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,190
我开始觉得你是对的
I'm starting to think you're right.

221
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,910
好吧  我受够了
All right, I've had enough of this.

222
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,470
我是个成年人  我有成功的事业
I'm a grown man, I have a successful career.

223
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,980
看在上帝的份上  我还去过太空呢
For the love of God, I've been to space!

224
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,680
当我准备好时  我就会搬出去住
I will move out when I'm ready,

225
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,150
我不需要任何人没完没了地烦我
and I don't need anyone badgering me into it!

226
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,930
哎哟  我先告辞了
Wow, excuse me.

227
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,010
那话只是冲她说的
That was just for her benefit.

228
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,310
我明天就搬  我爱你  别离开我
I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.

229
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
艾米
Amy.

230
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
艾米
Amy.

231
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,150
愤怒的艾米
Angry Amy.

232
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,690
有何贵干
What?

233
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,960
我考虑了一下之前发生的事
I've been thinking about what happened,

234
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,250
我希望这个礼物
and I hope this gift

235
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,090
能让事态缓和点
will make things better.

236
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,960
《星际迷航》系列DVD
Star Trek DVDs?

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,190
我为何需要这个
Why would I want this?

238
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,030
首先  不客气
First of all, you're welcome.

239
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,300
再者  如果你不熟悉威尔·惠顿的作品
Furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work

240
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,550
你就不可能意识到
there was no way for you to know

241
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,080
你曾对这样的一位国家瑰宝出言不逊
you were being rude to a national treasure.

242
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,180
准备迎接130小时的"早知道就听你"的吧
Get ready for 130 hours of "I told you so."

243
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,380
好吧  由我来告诉你都演了些什么
Fine. I'll just tell you what happens.

244
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,510
第一集  《远点遭遇战》
Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint."

245
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,770
缓缓驶入
Fade in.

246
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,550
新进取号踏上了搜寻戴纳伯四号星球
The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage

247
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,210
居住的班迪人之处女航行
to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

248
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,120
卫斯理·克拉希尔登场了  扮演者是我兄弟...
Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy...

249
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,820
她要爱不释手了
She's hooked.

250
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,250
一个时代的终结啊
An end of an era.

251
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,120
唉  真希望这些墙能诉说衷肠
Boy, if these walls could talk.

252
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,230
那这些墙会说"为何他这么喜欢自摸"
They'd say, "Why does he touch himself so much?"

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
是啊
Yeah.

254
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,760
真不敢相信今后将不住这里了
I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore.

255
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,300
这里一直都是我的卧室
This has always been my bedroom.

256
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,600
那里就是我妈以前测量我身高的地方
Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.

257
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
真的哎
Oh, yeah.

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,480
我还记得我五岁那年
I remember when I was five,

264
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,450
拿着我的万圣节糖果躲在这个桌子下面
hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy.

265
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,880
吃了一些M&M花生糖豆
Had some Peanut M&M'S,

266
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,080
迎来了我第一次过敏性休克
went into my first anaphylactic shock

267
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,250
然后被送去医院
and had to be rushed to the hospital.

268
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,200
回到家后  吃花生士力架来欢庆康复
Came home, celebrated with a Snickers,

269
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,750
紧接着又迎来第二次过敏性休克
went into my second anaphylactic shock.

270
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,410
你什么时候发现对坚果过敏的
When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?

271
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,800
大概在第三次吃杏仁巧克力时吧
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

272
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,120
好吧
Okay.

273
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,070
要开始把这些东西搬上货车吗
You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?

274
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,110
好  搬吧
Yeah, I guess.

275
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,140
能帮我个忙吗
Hey, would you do me a favor?

276
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,060
你们先走
Go on ahead.

277
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,680
我只想在旧居里再独享这最后一刻
I just want one last moment alone in my old room.

278
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
我们才不要站在搬家货车边上等着
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul

279
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,770
你在这自摸爽完一发
while you fondle yourself.

280
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,180
好吧  一起走吧
Fine, let's go.

281
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,300
什么风把你吹来了
What brings you in?

282
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,040
佩妮  如果你不介意
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,

283
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,370
我想跟你谈谈女生
I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

284
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,800
我早预感到我们迟早会聊到的
I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later.

285
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,040
你某个奇怪的地方终于长毛了吗
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

286
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,250
佩妮  拜托
Penny, please,

287
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,930
我现在进退两难
I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma.

288
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,560
同时声明  我到19岁那年
And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair

289
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,590
就已经长完了浓密的阴毛
by the time I was 19.

290
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,570
同时我也声明...
And for the record...

291
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,510
你打算喝点什么
So what are you drinking?

292
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,960
今天超不顺
Well, it's been a rough day.

293
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,580
我通常喝甘菊茶
I usually go chamomile tea,

294
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,480
但我觉得喝那个没用了
but I don't think that's going to cut it.

295
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,390
你可以来一杯长岛冰茶呀
You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.

296
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,050
那个能舒缓我的神经吗
Will that calm my nerves?

297
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,060
好几次把我舒缓到裤子都"没了"
It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.

298
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,200
来一杯
Sold.

299
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,690
你那巫师得来的心脏让你陷入麻烦了吗
So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?

300
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,150
问题不在我这  佩妮
The trouble isn't with me, Penny,

301
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,690
而在你们女人身上
it's with your gender.

302
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,130
总有一天  科学家们会发现
Someday, scientists will discover

303
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,100
女性的第二条X染色体除了胡说
that second X chromosome contains nothing

304
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,230
和废话之外  其他一无所有
but nonsense and twaddle.

305
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,240
是啊  艾米告诉我发生了什么事
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

306
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,480
听着  道歉就行
Look, just apologize.

307
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,150
它会融解她的废话
It'll warm her twaddle.

308
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,330
那顶多治标不治本
It's a band-aid at best.

309
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,100
核心问题在于艾米和威尔互相讨厌
The core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other.

310
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,830
这点很莫名其妙  因为他们都为我痴狂
Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me.

311
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,800
我也喜欢他们俩
And I like them,

312
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,360
这表明他们是聪明人  并且还喜欢
which indicates they're bright and interesting

313
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,530
或曾演过《星际迷航》
and/or were on Star Trek.

314
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,230
亲爱的  你不能逼别人互相喜欢
Honey, you can't make people like each other.

315
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,530
非也
Not true.

316
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,390
莱纳德让我喜欢你
Leonard made me like you.

317
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,780
不瞒你说  这事可不容易啊
And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,750
干杯吧  姐们
Cheers, pal.

319
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,610
好家伙  这可真是一杯无与伦比的饮品
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

320
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,020
快让疯帽先生来吧  我要开个茶话会
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.
疯帽先生  《爱丽丝梦游仙境》角色  喜欢举办茶话会

321
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,620
你或许该慢慢喝
You might want to pace yourself.

322
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,430
我常喝茶啦
I drink tea all the time.

323
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,990
我懂我在干嘛
I think I know what I'm doing.

324
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,680
我没资格批评一位长齐阴毛的人啊
Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis.

325
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,310
谢尔顿  问题不在威尔·惠顿这  好吗
Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay?

326
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,580
你的问题在于你对待艾米的方式
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

327
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,550
我的问题是我的茶喝光了
My problem is I'm out of tea.

328
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,640
拜托  有人对你女友出言不逊
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend

329
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,970
你却听之任之
and you just let him do it.

330
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,100
我还以为德州爷们会为女友挺身而出呢
I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.

331
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,660
得了吧  佩妮
Penny, please,

332
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,030
我可比头脑简单的乡野村夫有教养
I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

333
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,080
抱歉
Sorry.

334
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,380
不过话说回来
On the other hand,

335
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,190
那个卑鄙小人敢对我女人口出狂言
that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.

336
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,470
"长岛"的酒劲上来了  德州仔
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

337
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
艾米不应该被这样对待
Amy deserves better.

338
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,680
我们买绅士什锦果仁时
You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix,

339
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,570
她会帮我先吃光巴西坚果
she eats all the Brazil nuts

340
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,360
这样我就不用看到它们
so I don't have to look at them.

341
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,530
她是独一无二的圣人与松鼠结合体
She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

342
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,970
对  她是的
Yeah, that she is.

343
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,870
给你
Here you go.

344
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,990
我无情麻木又自我
I'm a callous egomaniac.

345
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,420
她会离开我的
She's gonna leave me.

346
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,580
她不会的
No, she won't.

347
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,600
对  她不会的  我这么棒的男人
No, she won't. I'm great.

348
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,410
好了  现在
Okay, I have now

349
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,120
我正式搬出了我母亲大人的家
officially moved out of my mother's house.

350
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,980
现在我生活中唯一会在浴室
You are now the only woman in my life

351
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,920
撞见的裸女就剩你啦
who I'll see naked in the bathroom.

352
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,760
我知道这不容易
I know this wasn't easy.

353
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
你还好吗
You doing okay?

354
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,240
我没事
Oh, I'm fine.

355
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,550
我只是担心我妈
It's just her I'm worried about.

356
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,090
她不会有事的
Aw, she'll be okay.

357
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,020
-她是成年人  -我知道
- She's a grown woman. - I know.

358
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,090
只是我爸离开后
It's just ever since my dad left,

359
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,620
我就觉得  我对她有责任
I've felt responsible for her.

360
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,160
这对一个孩子来说责任太重了
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

361
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,290
她总是很伤心
She was just so sad all the time.

362
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,610
我是唯一可以令她开心起来的人
Yeah, I was the only person who could cheer her up.

363
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,100
我还有"本与杰瑞"牌冰淇淋
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

364
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,020
她很幸运能有你的陪伴
She's lucky you were there.

365
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,870
因为她  我才学魔术的
You know, she's why I first got into magic.

366
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,130
我会表演给她看
I would do little shows for her,

367
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,750
挂上床单  好像幕布一样
hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,

368
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,630
戴上礼帽  穿上披风
put on a top hat and cape.

369
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,740
表演中
And part way through the act,

370
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,420
我会说我需要从观众中请一位志愿者
I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience

371
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,220
做我美丽的助手
to be my beautiful assistant

372
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,990
邀请她上台
and invite her up on stage.

373
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,730
我依然记得她当时笑的样子
I can still remember the way she'd smile.

374
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,330
在那短暂的几分钟里  她...
For a few minutes, she'd...

375
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,400
忘了自己有多孤单
forget how lonely she was.

376
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,550
见鬼  走吧
Aw, crap. Let's go.

377
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,920
去哪里
Where we going?

378
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,790
搬个箱子
Grab a box.

379
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,610
我们今晚睡你母亲家
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.

380
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,660
可我想住在这里
No, but I want to live here.

381
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,730
在你告诉我那个
Well, you should've thought of that

382
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,170
傻逼催泪魔术故事前就该想到这点了
before you told me the stupid magic trick story.

383
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,460
我们不能谈谈吗
Can't we talk about this?

384
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,150
我的老公决不允许伤他老娘的心
No husband of mine is gonna break his mother's heart!

385
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,690
威尔·惠顿
Wil Wheaton!

386
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,970
威尔·惠顿
Wil Wheaton!

387
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,320
等等  敲了几下了
Wait, how many was that?

388
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,530
谢尔顿  什么事
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

389
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,870
你真的想知道吗
Wouldn't you like to know?

390
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,680
你喝酒了吗
Have you been drinking?

391
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,200
只是喝了茶
Just tea.

392
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,920
我这辈子喝过的最好喝的茶
The best tea I've ever had.

393
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,470
你来干嘛
Why are you here?

394
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,220
我告诉你吧
I'll tell you.

395
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,560
我是德州仔
I'm from Texas.

396
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,030
还需要我多说吗
Need I say more?

397
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,660
是的  多说一点我比较明白
Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.

398
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,470
你对我的女人出言不逊
You insulted my woman.

399
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,840
我是来为她讨回公道的
I'm here to defend her honor.

400
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,070
两下  敲了两下
Two! It was two.

401
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,030
威尔·惠顿
Wil Wheaton!

402
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,520
现在准备好接受制裁吧
Now prepare yourself for what may come.

403
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,050
谢尔顿  你不会真觉得我们会打起来吧
Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we're gonna fight?

404
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,200
我的拳头抬起来
My fists are not up here

405
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,980
可不是给巨型隐形奶牛挤奶的
because I'm milking a giant invisible cow.

406
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,710
是要把道歉的话从你嘴里揍出来的
They're up to beat an apology out of you.

407
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,290
好的  对不起

As a matter of idle curiosity,

412

你觉得你家哪片灌木丛
which of your shrubberies do you feel

413
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,060
可以被呕吐物施肥一下

414
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,170
算了  我自己选
Never mind, I'll choose.
