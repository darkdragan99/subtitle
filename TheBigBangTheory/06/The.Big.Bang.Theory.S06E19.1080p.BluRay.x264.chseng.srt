1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,540
你在干嘛
What you doing?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,670
你叫我收拾嘛
You said clean up.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,870
我就在收拾啊
I'm cleaning up.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,450
你不能只把东西都往衣橱里扔啊
You can't just throw everything in the closet.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,980
你可以叫我做事
Hey, you can tell me what to do

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,560
或者是教我做事
or you can tell me how to do it,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,500
但只有做爱时  才可以边叫边教
but you can't do both; this isn't sex.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,560
要是有人看到里面怎么办
What if someone looks in there?

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,180
他们只是来吃顿饭而已
They're just coming over for dinner.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,960
没人会看衣橱的啦
No one's gonna look in the closet.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,950
谁知道啊
Well, you don't know that.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,180
万一有人找厕所
What if someone's looking for the bathroom

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,310
不小心打开了这扇门呢
and they open that door?

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,430
也行啊
Could work out.

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,520
这里面某处还真有个厕所呢
For all we know, there's a toilet in there somewhere.

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,790
好吧  但今晚过后
Fine. But after tonight,

17
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,610
我们就得好好整理这衣橱
we need to get a handle on this mess.

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,360
知道我们应该怎么做吗
You know what we should do?

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,900
故意让谢尔顿看到这衣橱
We should show the closet to Sheldon.

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,720
为什么
Why?

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,880
你傻啦
Are you kidding?

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,720
他简直是整理大师好吗
He's like a savant at organizing.

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,360
他公寓里所有东西都有标签注明
Everything in his apartment has a label on it.

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,040
连他的标签机上  都有个标签
Including his label maker, which has a label

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,840
写着"标签机"
that says "Label Maker."

26
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,290
而且如果你仔细往标签机上的标签看
And if you look really close at that label maker label,

27
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,360
你会发现有个小小标签写着"标签"
you'll see a label that says "Label."

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,550
他是客人
He's our guest;

29
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,900
我们怎么可以让客人整理衣橱呢
we can't just ask him to straighten our closet.

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,060
我们当然不会问他来做
No, we wouldn't ask him.

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,660
我们只要让他瞧见就行了
We'd just show him the closet

32
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,260
之后他脑子里的小妖精就会煽动他了
and let the goblins in his head take it from there.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,460
大家请进
Hey, guys, come on in.

34
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,300
-闻起来好香啊  -谢谢
- Ooh, it smells good. - Thanks.

35
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,610
谢尔顿  我知道今晚是你的泰国菜之夜
And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food,

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,740
所以我去了亚洲超市  买了一切所需材料
so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,920
从零开始学
and made it from scratch.

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,860
你不用这样大费周章
Oh, you shouldn't have.

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,130
这是我的荣幸
Oh, it's my pleasure.

40
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,230
不  你真的不用这样
No, you really shouldn't have.

41
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,670
我自己带了
I brought my own.

42
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,260
你中间还带他去买外卖啦
You stopped and got him takeout?

43
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,180
我没得选嘛
I had no choice.

44
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,370
他一直踢我驾驶座背后
He kept kicking the back of my seat.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,040
谢尔顿  我花了一整天时间煮呢
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.

46
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,140
好吧...  现在觉得自己蠢了吧
Well... now don't you feel silly.

47
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,890
带他去看衣橱
Show him the closet.

48
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,640
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十九集

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,260
这春卷真是太美味了
These spring rolls are amazing.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,900
好手艺啊  伯纳黛特
Good job, Bernadette.

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,610
那是谢尔顿带来的外卖
That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,260
我肯定要不是先吃了你的菜
Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,330
这玩意肯定没那么好吃
nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,860
霍华德  你的衣服想怎么分类
Howard, did you want your clothes arranged

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,940
是按季节  还是按颜色
seasonally or by color?

56
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,760
按颜色就行了
Color's fine.

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,790
错误  我会按季分类
Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,290
谢尔顿  你不坐下陪陪艾米吗
Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?

59
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,030
没事的  我习惯了
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

60
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,080
那天在超市  他花了一个小时
The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,930
最佳化起司区的排列法
optimizing the cheese aisle.

62
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,850
是啊  但他们都不感激
Yeah, and some thanks I got.

63
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,620
助理经理还用手工制意大利香肠
The assistant manager chased me out

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,640
赶我走呢
with an artisanal salami.

65
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,020
他的小怪癖让人更爱他
His quirks just make you love him more.

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,800
你们谁也附和我一下嘛
Someone please agree with me.

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,510
谢尔顿  好啦
Sheldon, come on.

68
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,740
时间晚了  回家吧
It's getting late. Time to go.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,570
再给我五分钟
Oh, five more minutes.

70
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,520
你五分钟前就这么说过了
That's what you said five minutes ago.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,040
艾米和佩妮都在车上等了
Amy and Penny are already in the car.

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,660
走吧
Let's move it.

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,790
为什么总不让我做我想做的事啊
How come I never get to do anything I want to do?

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
他要是真的想留下到整理完毕
You know, if he really wants to stay and finish,

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,590
我可以载他回家
I can give him a ride home.

76
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,910
求你了  莱纳德  他都说没关系了
Please, Leonard! He said it's okay!

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,250
谢尔顿  都...
Sheldon, it's--

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,340
等等  可以不用载你回家吗  拜拜
Wait, I can go home without you? Bye!

79
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,620
霍华德  我有几个问题
Howard, I have a few questions.

80
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,250
我找到了三个保龄球瓶
I found three bowling pins.

81
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,400
这是抛接用的三个瓶呢
Now, do you juggle these,

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,340
还是你丢了七个
or are you missing seven?

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,380
杂耍抛接
Juggle.

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,300
小混球害我要想破头了
You health nuts kill me.

85
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,970
天啊  太整齐了
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

86
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,800
看  他发现了我藏起来的抛接球瓶
Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,990
还有几样东西
Uh, just a couple more items.

88
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,950
霍华德  我在盒子里找到这封你爸写的信
Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box.

89
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,490
根据里面的内容呢
Now, based on the content,

90
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,650
可以被分类去...
it could either be filed...

91
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,050
你还打开看啦
Whoa, you opened this?

92
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,240
得读过才知道这是私人信件
Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence

93
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,850
还是纪念性的信件  我刚说到
or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying,

94
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,470
-根据内容呢...  -我没兴趣知道
- based on the content... - I couldn't be less interested.

95
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,640
走吧  我载你回家吧
Now, come on, I'll take you home.

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,930
霍华德  你不想知道信里的内容吗
Howard, don't you want to know what's in the letter?

97
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,190
我要想知道  我多年前就拆开看了
If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago.

98
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,400
衣橱现在看起来超整洁
The closet looks great.

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,850
咱们走吧
Let's get out of here.

100
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,260
等等  我能拿上这盒
Wait, can I bring this box

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,950
备用衣服纽扣  在车上整理着玩吗
of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?

102
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,360
-你高兴就好  -谢谢
- Do whatever you want. - Thanks.

103
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,060
今晚派对超棒
Great party.

104
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,510
你知道我刚认识霍华德那会
You know, when I first met Howard,

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,300
他会把阴囊从短裤里拉出来
he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts

106
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,750
然后大喊  "看  我坐到口香糖上了"
and say, "oh, I sat in gum."

107
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,580
你到底想说什么
What is your point?

108
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,060
如今他变得这么成熟  感觉怪怪的
Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now.

109
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,450
婚姻美满  还会在家宴请朋友
Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.

110
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,010
是吗  你直接这么说不行吗
Really? You couldn't just say that?

111
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,320
还非得讲一遍阴囊的故事
You had to tell the scrotum story?

112
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,960
描述下他以前幼稚的画面嘛
Trying to paint a picture.

113
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,940
换个方式  不再围着咖啡桌吃外卖
Yeah, it was a nice change of pace

114
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,870
的确也是不错的改变
not eating takeout around a coffee table.

115
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,570
要知道  我们也可以宴请一下朋友们
Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too.

116
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,600
还可以要求大家都盛装出席
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,550
好呀
Sure.

118
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,050
不过  你所谓的盛装出席
Just, when you say "Dressed up,"

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,120
是指穿着得体的衣服  是吧
you mean nice clothes, right?

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,660
而不是指穿着斗篷紧身衣之类的玩意
Not, like, capes and tights and crap?

121
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,520
当然
Yeah.

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,550
-不过  -不行
- Although... - No!

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,520
华仔  你没事吧
Howie, you okay?

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,740
没事  我只是...睡不着
Yeah, I just... couldn't sleep.

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,990
都叫你晚餐后别喝浓缩咖啡了
Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner.

126
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,440
我知道那些小杯子显得你人高马大
I know the little cups make you feel big,

127
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,150
可这实在是得不偿失呀
but it's not worth it.

128
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,420
都怪这份讨厌的信
It's this stupid letter.

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,830
你看了吗
Did you read it?

130
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,380
没有
No.

131
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,970
你一定很好奇
You must be curious.

132
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,620
我当然好奇了
Of course I'm curious.

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,050
从很小的时候
I haven't seen the man since,

134
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,510
我就再也没见过他了
oh, I was a little kid.

135
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,440
然后在我18岁生日时突然寄来一封信
And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday?

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,130
这算是什么意思
What's that about?

137
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,470
你为什么不读读看呢
Why don't you read it?

138
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,240
也许他为不辞而别做出了道歉或者解释
Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,690
他抛弃了我和我妈
He abandoned me and my mother.

140
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,980
他有什么资格来做解释呢
Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
我明白
I get that.

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,040
那你准备怎么办呢
So, what do you want to do with it?

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
很久以前我就应该这么做了
Something I should've done a long time ago.

144
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,710
-真的  你确定吗  -确定
- Really? Are you sure? - Yep.

145
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,700
-心里舒服点了吗  -舒服了
- Feel better? - I do.

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,270
这下好了
Great.

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,590
咱俩的身高都够不着那烟雾报警器
Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.

148
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,180
我真不敢相信他烧掉了那封信
I can't believe he set it on fire.

149
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,820
对啊  他看到那封信就心烦
Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out.

150
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,870
再说他那天本来就过得不开心
And he was already having a tough day

151
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,580
他不小心穿着我的裤子去上班了
'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work.

152
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,770
我真不懂他有什么不开心的
I don't know why he was upset.

153
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,050
他穿那裤子比我穿着还宽松呢
They were bigger on him than me.

154
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,450
我真好奇那信里写了什么
Boy, I'm really curious what's in that letter.

155
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,830
我也好奇  不过我们永远无法知道了
Me, too, but I guess now we'll never know.

156
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,130
你说谢尔顿读过那封信
Well, you said Sheldon read it.

157
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,360
何不去问问他
Why not ask him?

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,140
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

159
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,240
不尊重老公的隐私
What kind of wife would I be

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,430
还算什么好人妻呢
if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?

161
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,630
如果我去问谢尔顿的时候
What if I ask Sheldon,

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,100
你"碰巧"在场呢
you just happen to be in the room?

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,450
-这主意好  -走吧
- That works. - Okay.

164
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,060
就跟清理整幢大楼的脏肚脐眼似的
Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button.

165
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,520
-谢尔顿  -你们好
- Hey, Sheldon. - Oh, hello.

166
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,280
有什么能为你们效劳的吗
What can I do for you ladies?

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,140
你有我们想要的东西
You have something we want.

168
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,900
乖乖
Oh, dear.

169
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,690
我妈曾经警告过我
My mother warned me

170
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,600
小帅哥进了大城市  就会遇到这种事
this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.

171
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,200
不  我们想要知道点信息
No, we just want information.

172
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,700
这个我绝对能帮上忙
Oh, I've got that in spades.

173
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
用问题蹂躏我吧
Ravage me.

174
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,960
我们听说你读了霍华德他爸写的信
We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.

175
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,990
我读了
I did.

176
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,920
信里写了什么
What did it say?

177
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,910
这个
Yeah...

178
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,490
我可不能告诉你们
I can't tell you that.

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,840
我得遵守衣橱主人和整理者之间的保密协议
I'm bound by closet organizer/ organizee confidentiality.

180
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,870
谢尔顿  世上才没有那种规定呢
Sheldon, that's not a real thing.

181
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,720
那世上也没有规定说看电影时
Well, neither is the rule that you have to

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,130
必须紧握你女友的手呀
hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies. You know.

183
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,800
你还不是照样对我上下其手
That doesn't stop you from pawing at me

184
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,810
就像你是大狗熊  我是蜜罐子一样
like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.

185
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,290
你管什么多干嘛
Why do you even care?

186
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,630
把信的内容告诉我们就是了
Just tell us what it says.

187
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,110
那封信的内容的所有权
Control over the information contained in that letter

188
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,290
是属于霍华德的
belongs to Howard.

189
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,440
我是偶尔不小心读到的
By happenstance, I came to know it.

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,320
这并不代表我可以到处散布它
That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.

191
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,760
拜托  那封信是在伯纳黛特的衣橱找到的
Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet.

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
这好歹也意味点什么吧
Doesn't that count for something?

193
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,030
你是想说加州政府是
Are you pointing out that California

194
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,500
认同联合财产的
is a community property state,

195
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,790
既然霍华德和伯纳黛特已经结婚了
and since Howard and Bernadette are married,

196
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,000
那么那封信所含有的知识产权
the intellectual property contained in that letter

197
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,040
理应由夫妇俩人共享吗
is jointly owned by the two spouses?

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,820
对  就是这个意思
Yeah, obviously.

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,210
你厉害
Well played.

200
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
有时候我真是小看你了  佩妮
Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.

201
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,910
老兄  你来找我商量开派对的事
Dude, you made the right choice

202
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,840
真是找对人了
coming to me for help with this party.

203
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,420
其实  我只是邀请了你而已
Actually, all I did was invite you.

204
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,730
好了  你就放宽心吧
Well, put your mind at ease.

205
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,620
有我相助  霍华德的晚宴
I'm here to make sure your dinner party

206
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,400
一定会被你的晚宴打得落花流水
kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.

207
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,200
现在我们首先需要确定一个主题
Now, the first thing we need is a theme.

208
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,080
我在想
I'm thinking...

209
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,950
19到20世纪之交时期的红磨坊
ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.

210
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,440
我觉得你需要贴睾酮贴片增加雄性激素了
I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.

211
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,180
我和佩妮是想以低调为主
Penny and I just want to do something low-key.

212
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,510
就像鸡尾酒
You know, cocktails,

213
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,200
轻柔的爵士乐  开胃小吃
light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,660
所以你的主题是
So your theme is

215
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,520
"我看了一集《广告狂人》的重播
"I saw a rerun of Mad Men

216
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,750
然后从连锁超市买来蟹肉酥"
and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's"?

217
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,180
我可不想错过
Hate to miss that.

218
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,100
你去哪里了
Hey, where have you been?

219
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard.

220
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,980
如果我要讥讽你的话
If I was prone to sarcasm,

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,110
我会说我刚在洗衣篮博物馆里
I'd say I was pulling off a major heist

222
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,110
干了一票大劫案
at the museum of laundry baskets.

223
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,870
一  二  三  四  五
One, two, three, four, five,

224
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,080
六  七  八  九  十[愤怒控制]
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,690
我是说  "天啊  谢尔顿
I meant, "Golly, Sheldon,

226
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,490
你刚去了有够久的"
you've been gone a long time."

227
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,100
因为我被佩妮和伯纳黛特
Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by

228
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,000
还有艾米拦住问话了
Penny, Bernadette and Amy.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
她们让我泄露霍华德父亲的
They made me reveal confidential information

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,500
机密信息
about Howard's father.

231
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,660
什么信息
What information?

232
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,550
我不能告诉你们
I can't tell you that.

233
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,670
我必须遵守
I am bound by closet

234
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,890
衣橱主人和整理者之间的保密协议
organizer/ organizee confidentiality.

235
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,220
拜托啦  我们不会告诉任何人的
Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.

236
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,670
抱歉  纠缠我也没用
Sorry, badgering me won't work.

237
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,180
你应该这么说
What you should have said is,

238
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,640
"没必要保守这个秘密
"It's pointless to keep this a secret

239
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,860
因为佩妮会告诉我们的"
because Penny will tell us."

240
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,410
-那我问佩妮  -好吧  我告诉你们
- Fine, then that. - All right, I'll tell you.

241
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,140
天啊  今天每个人都很会找理由嘛
My goodness, everyone's on their game today.

242
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,840
这真的很好玩
This is really fun.

243
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,290
是啊  偶尔穿正装也不错
Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.

244
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,970
对啊  开胃小吃令人愉悦
Yeah, and hors d'oeuvres are delightful.

245
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,180
就像我的女伴
As is the company.

246
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,010
我的衣服痒死了  真希望死了算了
My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.

247
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,130
大家  听着
Hey, uh, listen, everybody.

248
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,120
在霍华德来之前  我们统一口径
Before Howard gets here, let's all just agree

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,780
不要提起他父亲的信
to not bring up the letter from his father.

250
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,490
-好  -知道
- Of course. - Sure.

251
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,600
当然不会
Absolutely.

252
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,610
如果我也同意
If I say yes,

253
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,280
能不能关掉那拉丁的放荡音乐
can we turn off that Latin orgy music?

254
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,030
我们还得走这么多层楼梯
Ridiculous that we still have to walk

255
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,950
真是太荒谬了
up all these flights of stairs.

256
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,580
对啊  尤其是穿着高跟鞋
Yeah, try doing it in heels.

257
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,130
我就穿着呢
I am.

258
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,210
慢着
Wait.

259
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,820
我有话要对你说
There's something I have to tell you.

260
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,920
什么
What?

261
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,680
我知道那封信的内容了
I know what was in your dad's letter.

262
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,150
谢尔顿  我发誓我一定要杀了你
Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!

263
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,050
是我逼他告诉我们的
I made him tell us.

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,310
"我们"
What? "Us"?

265
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,640
谁还知道
Who else knows?

266
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,940
-我  -我也是
- I know. - Me, too.

267
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,140
还有我
Same here.

268
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,210
真为你们感到羞耻
Shame on all of you.

269
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,530
你不也知道了吗
You know, too.

270
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,310
非得全军覆没  就不能给他留一个朋友吗
Couldn't leave him with one friend, could you?

271
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,080
所以除了我
So everybody knows

272
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,940
大家都知道那封信的内容
what's in that letter except for me?

273
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,210
对  现在是六对一
Yes, it's six against one.

274
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,870
别轻举妄动  先生
Stand down, sir.

275
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
你怎么能这样呢
How could you do this?

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
对不起
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,630
如果你想知道  我们可以告诉你
If you want, we could tell you.

278
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,690
不  我不想知道
No, I don't want to know!

279
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,630
我是说
I mean,

280
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,620
我是想知道  但...
I do, but...

281
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,350
我要走了
I got to go.

282
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,650
用我来当人肉盾牌
Used me as a human shield?

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,170
人家慌了嘛
I panicked.

284
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,460
他比平时看起来高大
He looked taller than usual.

285
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,800
-霍华德  -这里
- Howard? - In here.

286
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,250
我不应该多事的
I should have left it alone.

288
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,040
没关系
It's okay.

289
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,130
抱歉我就这么走了
Sorry I ran off like that.

290
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,400
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

291
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,350
我小时候跟爸爸的合照
Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.

292
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,980
-那很好啊  -不得不说
- That's nice.  - I got to tell you,

293
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,100
虽然谢尔顿泄密让我很生气
as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing,

294
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,960
但他的确把这个衣橱整理得很好
he did a hell of a job organizing this closet.

295
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,120
瞧瞧这个
Look at this.

296
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,280
"父亲永别前  沃罗威茨一家照片"
"Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever."

297
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,350
瞧九岁时满头小辫子的华仔
Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows.

298
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,280
无论黑人犹太人  看了都会不爽
Neither race was happy to see me with those.

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,760
-你想不想休息一下  -为什么
- Think you could take a break? - Why?

300
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,390
我有个惊喜要给你
Got a little surprise for you.

301
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,360
来吧
Come on.

302
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,510
亲爱的
Oh, honey...

303
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,470
我今晚没心情做爱
I am in no mood to have sex tonight.

304
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,530
如果你一定要做
I'll lay there if you absolutely

305
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,220
那我就勉强躺在下面好了
have to have it, but...

306
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,710
你们来这里干嘛
What are you guys doing here?

307
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,400
你走时并没有很明确表明
When you left, you weren't sure whether or not

308
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,350
自己是否想知道信上的内容
you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter,

309
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,440
所以我们想出了一个很酷的解决办法
so we came up with kind of a cool solution.

310
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,930
是吗  是什么
Oh, yeah, what's that?

311
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,300
很简单
It's simple, really.

312
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,600
我突然意识到  知道和不知道
It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing

313
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,110
可以通过创造量子力学叠加状态的
can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example

314
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,860
宏观例子来完成
of quantum superposition.

315
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,020
原理是
The-the principle

316
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,720
物理系统部分存在于
that a physical system exists partially

317
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,060
所有可能状态
in all its possible states at once.

318
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,360
我们都是这样想的  真的
We were all thinking it, really.

319
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,690
这就像房里的大象一样[显而易见]
It was kind of the elephant in the room, so...

320
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,200
总之  我意识到
Anyway, um, I realize

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,060
如果我们每人对你父亲信件的内容
if we each present you with an account

322
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,620
作出一番陈述
of what your father wrote to you,

323
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,490
但只有一个是真的
only one of which is true,

324
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,730
我们不告诉你哪个是真的
and then we don't tell you which one it is,

325
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,360
你会永远
you will forever be

326
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,850
处于认知的矛盾状态中
in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

327
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,800
对
Yeah.

328
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,140
我说如果不是认知的
And I said if it wasn't epistemic,

329
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,170
咱们就干脆别忙活了
we might as well not do it.

330
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,230
坐下  亲爱的
Sit down, honey.

331
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,800
拉杰  你先来
Raj, you're up.

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,370
好的
Okay, um...

333
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,870
那是一张庆祝你18岁的生日卡
It was a card for your 18th birthday.

334
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,310
上面写着
Inside it said,

335
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,010
"生日快乐  霍华德
"Happy birthday, Howard.

336
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,520
我爱你  老爸"
I love you. Dad."

337
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,910
而且还是一张搞笑贺卡
Oh, and it was a Far Side card,

338
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,610
一只青蛙的舌头粘在了
the one where the frog has its tongue

339
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,960
飞机的下面
stuck to the underside of an airplane.

340
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
它以为飞机是苍蝇
Thinks it's a fly.

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,780
白痴青蛙  太搞笑了
Silly frog. So funny.

342
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,010
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

343
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,100
那是一张藏宝图  可以找到著名海盗
It was a map leading to the lost treasure

344
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,060
独眼韦利传说中的宝藏
of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.

345
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,240
亏你想的到
Nice try.

346
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
这是《七宝奇谋》的情节
That's the plot for Goonies.

347
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,080
-早说了  -闭嘴
-Told you. - Don't.

348
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,160
艾米
Amy.

349
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,540
你并不知道
You didn't know it,

350
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,390
但你高中毕业时
but your father was in the auditorium

351
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,680
你父亲在观众席上
at your high school graduation.

352
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,810
他哭了  因为他为你骄傲
And he cried because he was so proud of you.

353
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,260
真的吗
Really?

354
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
也有可能完全是艾米瞎编的废话
Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up.

355
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,190
藏宝图才是真的
It still could be the map.

356
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,250
佩妮
Penny.

357
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,520
那封信是解释
It was a letter explaining

358
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,590
你父亲的真实身份
that your dad wasn't who he said he was.

359
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,540
当时他另一个身份的麻烦找上了他
Eventually, his other life caught up to him,

360
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,440
唯一保护你们母子安全的办法
and the only way to keep you and your mom safe

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
就是他离开
was to leave.

362
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,040
我想改变我的故事
I would like to change mine.

363
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,840
海盗的名字其实叫假腿安托万
The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.

364
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,370
现在和《七宝奇谋》就完全不同了
Now it's completely different from Goonies.

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,470
-没什么区别  -闭嘴
-No, it's not. - Don't.

366
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,940
到我了
Okay, my turn.

367
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,190
你爸写的是  家庭是世界上最重要的
Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing,

368
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,270
希望你不要像他那样不懂珍惜
and that you should never throw it away like he did.

369
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,670
伯纳黛特
Bernadette.

370
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,620
信封里有张照片
Inside the envelope was a picture

371
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,150
拍的是你出生时你爸抱着你
of your dad holding you the day you were born.

372
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,090
照片背后他写着
On the back he wrote,

373
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,230
"霍华德  儿子  你是我最好的礼物"
"Howard, my son, my greatest gift."

374
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,910
你还好吗
You okay?

375
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,920
没事
Yeah.

376
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,450
好得不得了
I'm terrific.

377
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,650
那么
So...?

378
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,090
你觉得哪一个是真的
Which one do you think it is...

379
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,820
好兄弟[海盗用语]
matey?

380
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,260
事实上  我不想知道
Actually, I don't want to know.

381
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,600
我
I...

382
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,130
希望这些全是真的
want all of them to be true.

383
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,520
有一个是真的
Well, one of them is.

384
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,220
那非常好
That's pretty cool.

385
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,860
谢谢各位
Thank you, guys.

386
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,810
时间还早
Hey, it's still early.

387
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,340
不如回去继续开派对吧
Why don't we go back and have that party?

388
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,110
好的
Yeah, cool.

389
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,730
出人意料的是
You know, surprisingly,

390
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,000
你父亲的信
uh, the letter from your father

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
并不是我在衣橱里
wasn't the most interesting thing

392
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,310
看到的最有意思的东西
I read in the closet.

393
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,730
伯纳黛特日记的内容相当有料啊
Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.

394
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
谢尔顿  你敢
Sheldon, don't you dare!

395
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,690
不用担心
Th-There's nothing to worry about.

396
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,580
我不会泄露你的秘密
Your secret's safe with me.

397
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,680
这还差不多
That's more like it.

398
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,170
不过版权法允许我在回忆时
Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets

399
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,390
引用其中的片段
in the context of a review.

400
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,290
我很开心你心情好些了
Glad you're feeling better.

401
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,720
我也是
Me, too.

402
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,560
如果我知道我们要跳舞
If I'd known we were gonna be dancing,

403
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,110
就穿平底鞋来了
would have worn my flats.

404
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,560
派对真不错啊
This turned out pretty well, huh?

405
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,430
我也这样想
Yeah, I think so.

406
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,780
我同意
I agree.

407
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,880
前提是从未参加或听说过派对
That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.

408
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,120
如果你让我在你脑袋上正确的位置
If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle

409
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,410
用根滚烫的针刺一下  你就会永远开心了
in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.

410
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,250
佩妮
Uh, Penny,

411
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,500
关于你的衣橱  我有几个问题
I-I have a couple of questions about your closet.

412
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,280
你保留这只死鱼
Is there any reason

413
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,620
是有原因的吗
you're keeping this dead goldfish?

414
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,660
见鬼  我忘记喂食了
Damn, I forgot to feed him.

415
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,140
也忘记我养了鱼
And that I had him.

416
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,330
你还养了狗吗
Well, now, did you also have a dog?

417
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,380
我找到了一个
