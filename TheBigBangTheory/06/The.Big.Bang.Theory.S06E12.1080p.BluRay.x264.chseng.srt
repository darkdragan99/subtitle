1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,350
莱纳德  我不得不承认
Well, I must say, Leonard,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,310
你一开始提出巨型层层叠的主意时
when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,360
我是持怀疑态度的
I was skeptical.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,610
这不能怪你
I can't blame you--

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,330
上次的迷你版扭扭乐就烂爆了
Tiny Twister was a complete bust.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,780
但我这次错了
No, I was wrong.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,940
顶着可能会
The looming threat of

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,640
被一堆木头压死的风险玩
being crushed under a pile of lumber

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,350
让游戏带感了不少
does add a certain spice.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,020
连人都精神起来了
I've never felt so alive.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,060
你好啊  艾利克斯
Oh, hello, Alex.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,370
我去拿昨晚的录音给你
Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,490
什么录音
What recordings?

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,100
还记得你跟我说过  我会说梦话吗
Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,800
然后我想到  梦话跟我平时说的话一样
Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say,

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,100
含金量也应该超高的吧
it's probably pure gold.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,470
所以我开始录音
So I started recording it all,

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,940
而现在艾利克斯得好好梳理下
and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,230
我称为"谢家午夜论坛"的八小时长节目
of what I like to call "Sheldon After Dark."

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,160
-你好吗  莱纳德  -好啊
- Hey, Leonard. - Hey.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,860
我在玩巨型层层叠呢
Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,110
我知道啊  那顶安全帽就是我买的
Oh, I know-- I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,650
这周末你有什么安排吗
So, do you have any plans this weekend?

24
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,840
周六估计大多数时间得花在思考
Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,490
这玩具玩完后收哪里
where to put this game when we're done.

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,310
你呢
How about you?

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,600
我要去听基普·索恩博士的
Oh, I'm gonna go see Kip Thorne

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,110
亚原子时空讲座
give a lecture on subatomic space-time.

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,910
他会讲述对约翰·惠勒的量子泡沫看法
That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,050
应该会很精彩
That should be great.

31
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,890
有兴趣可以跟我一起去啊
Well, if you want, you can come with me.

32
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,500
我也想啊  可是我跟佩妮有约了
Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,620
带上她嘛
Well, bring her.

34
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,140
她对这类事情没什么兴趣
Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.

35
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,640
那好吧
Yeah, okay.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,100
那之后你对讲座内容有兴趣
Well, if you want to hear about the lecture,

37
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,680
我可以上班时跟你说
I can tell you all about it at work,

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,040
或者...  共进晚餐时跟你说哦
or, you know, over dinner sometime.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,800
什么
What?

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,620
你弄倒啦  我赢了
Jenga, I win!

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,470
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十二集

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,550
拜托  才不可能呢
Oh, come on, that can't be true.

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,260
我真查过了  托尼老虎
I did the research-- Tony the Tiger,

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,750
青蛙  克朗奇船长
Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch,

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,810
巨嘴鸟山姆  吸餐鬼伯爵
Toucan Sam, Count Chocula,

46
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,210
崔克斯兔  卜卜米三兄弟
Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,620
所有谷类早餐吉祥物都是男生
Not one cereal mascot is a girl.

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,770
谷物早餐界完全"基肠""露露"啊
It's a total breakfast sausage fest.

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,960
说完了吗
Are we done with this?

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,760
快了  红莓怪人  蓝莓鬼鬼
Almost-- Franken Berry, Boo Berry,

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,870
糖糖熊  蜜果圈圈蜂
Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee,

52
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,310
他的名字是叫巴兹[嗡嗡声]吧
I believe his name is Buzz.

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,110
很好很好
Terrific.

54
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,230
发生了一件怪事  我不知道该怎么办
Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it.

55
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,120
怎么了
What's going on?

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,800
谢尔顿的助理昨晚约我
Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,290
你怎么可以这么对我
How could you do that to me?

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,280
你明知道我泡她好一阵子了
You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,390
你怎么泡人家  你连说话都不敢
Working it? You can't even talk to her.

60
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,740
我用眼神跟她交流
I talk with my eyes.

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
我那个小表弟
You look like my little cousin

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,220
在尿布里拉屎时就这眼神
when he's dropping one in his diaper.

63
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,830
她都知道我有女朋友了
She knows I have a girlfriend.

64
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,590
真是太神奇了
It's so weird.

65
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,610
天啊  你居然还暗爽
Oh, my God. You're loving this.

66
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,210
暗爽到爆啊
To my bones.

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,270
我当然是不可能会对她下手啦  我爱佩妮
I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny.

68
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,700
只是有个年轻貌美的女性
It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
对我有意思也很不错嘛
sniffing around the goods.

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,880
我又恨你  又想当你
I both hate you and want to be you.

71
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,730
瑞恩·高斯林的事又重演了
This is Ryan Gosling all over again.

72
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,620
各位同志
Aw, gentlemen.

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,380
今早的聊天话题选项有什么呢
What is on the conversational menu this morning?

74
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,170
莱纳德抢了我的妞  他明明知道
Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well

75
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,270
我只差六到八个月就要对她展开攻势了
I was only six to eight months away from making my move.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,010
我才没抢走谁呢
I didn't steal anyone.

77
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,890
你的助理明摆着对他有意思
Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk

78
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,180
他还暗爽
and he loves it.

79
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,560
这样可不行
Well, that's not acceptable.

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,130
我是她的老板
I'm her boss.

81
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,430
她只能关注以及满足我的需求
She needs to be solely focused on my needs,

82
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,480
不该被你苍白无力
not distracted by your pasty,

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
雌雄难辨的弱鸡阳气吸引
androgynous brand of sexuality.

84
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,660
我怎么雌雄难辨了
I'm androgynous?

85
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,140
拜托哦  你也不看看
Oh, please. Look at you

86
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,690
你那爱撅起的腊肠嘴
with your pouty bee-stung lips.

87
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580
你们觉得我该怎么回应她
What do you guys think I should do?

88
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,430
我觉得你应该告诉她  你只爱佩妮
I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny,

89
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,090
然后我借肩膀给她哭诉
I provide her a shoulder to cry on,

90
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,970
然后差不多半年后  我就能给她"来一发"了
and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.

91
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,460
我要感谢你们能这么快就赶过来
I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice.

92
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,460
过去呢  我曾与在座各位
Uh, in the past, I've reached out

93
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,540
有过单独请益的时刻
to each of you individually,

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,220
但这次我觉得这次的情况
but I believe my present situation

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,220
需要你们一起共同集思广益
requires the collective wisdom of the group,

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,510
想必你们从纪念T恤上也能看得出
which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts

97
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,340
我标注上了
I have dubbed

98
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,050
谢尔顿·库伯姐妹顾问团
Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.

99
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,690
发生什么事了
What is happening?

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,290
我需要你们为一件敏感的职场关系给意见
I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation.

101
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,020
为了保护当事人隐私
Uh, to protect those involved,

102
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,130
我会替他们取假名
I'll be changing their names.

103
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,490
当事人有谁啊
Who's involved?

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,860
我的一个活在他绝顶聪明的
Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine

105
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,580
室友光环之下的四眼鸡矮子同事
who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate.

106
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,450
这叫他"里卡多·谢利沙力"吧
Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.

107
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,710
你是在说莱纳德
You're talking about Leonard.

108
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,480
不不  谢利沙力有一头红发
No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair

109
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,270
他曾在墨西哥海军短期服役过
and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy.

110
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,360
虽然他已经有一个女朋友
Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend,

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,890
谢利沙力是遭年轻女性
Shilly-Shally has been the recipient

112
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,580
对他做不适宜的职场调戏的受方
of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.

113
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,250
-攻方就是你的助理艾利克斯吧  -不对
- It's your assistant Alex, isn't it? - No.

114
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,790
才不是  是唐德莱娅·德拉·文蒂米利亚
Not... No. This is Tondelaya Della Ventimiglia.

115
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,810
等等  莱纳德跟艾利克斯到底是怎么回事
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?

116
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,650
抱歉  谁在说莱纳德和艾利克斯啊
I'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?

117
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,640
好吧  是里卡多和唐德莱娅
Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.

118
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,470
其实我要说的重点不是里卡多和唐德莱娅
Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya.

119
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,300
而是唐德莱娅的博士老板
It is really about her boss,

120
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,770
他不知道该如何处理这种情况
who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation

121
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,440
所以需要你们给出主意
and could use your advice,

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,070
这有些反常  因为爱因斯坦·冯·集思广益博士
which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

123
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,650
向来很会处理这种情况
He's usually pretty smart about these things.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,100
我要杀了她
I'm gonna kill her.

125
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,400
我相信你没什么好担心的
I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,140
莱纳德绝对不会背叛你
Leonard would never cheat on you.

127
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,250
她说得对
She's right.

128
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,810
但只要你开口  我有满满
But say the word-- I got a lab

129
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,290
一实验室不怕死的毒瘾疯猴  随时听候差遣
full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose.

130
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,950
可以扔一个进她的汽车后座
One of them could end up in the backseat of her car.

131
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,560
或是她的浴室
Or her shower.

132
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,190
女士们  女士们  拜托
Ladies, ladies, please.

133
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,070
我们不是来这里讨论佩妮的  好吗
We're not here to talk about Penny, okay?

134
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,500
我们是来讨论我的
We're here to talk about me.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,860
我是说爱因斯坦·冯·集思...  我靠
Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainst... Oh, darn it!

136
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,450
好吧  说溜嘴了
All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

137
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,100
那我就来解释下发生了什么事吧
Let me explain what's going on--

138
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,580
里卡多其实是莱纳德...
Ricardo is really Leonard...

139
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,020
我们知道发生了什么事  谢尔顿
We know what's going on, Sheldon!

140
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,650
那我应该怎么做
Well, what should I do?

141
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,520
艾利克斯是你的员工
Well, Alex is your employee.

142
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,910
如果她做出一些让莱纳德觉得不舒服的事
If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable,

143
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,470
那你应该跟她谈谈
you should talk to her.

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,030
不  他才没有不舒服呢
Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all.

145
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,340
他暗爽死了好吗
No, he's loving it.

146
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,950
对啊  他趾高气昂地好像自己有两米那么高
Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.

147
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,170
什么  他很暗爽
What... He's loving it?

148
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,330
谢尔顿  你得马上跟艾利克斯谈谈
Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.

149
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,450
谈谈  就只有这种建议啊
Talk to her? That's all you've got?

150
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,370
"谢尔顿·库伯姐妹顾问团"的名字这么牛气
With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies,

151
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,250
我本来期望很高呢
I really expected more.

152
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,610
把T恤还我
Give me back the T-shirts.

153
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,650
艾利克斯
Alex...

154
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,900
查下我的日程表
check my schedule.

155
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,960
今天下午我有什么安排
What does my afternoon look like?

156
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,650
我记得好像没有任何安排
I think it's pretty wide open.

157
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,550
慢着  四点有安排
Oh, wait. Here's something at 4:00.

158
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,390
"跟艾利克斯谈谈"
"Give Alex a talking to"?

159
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,910
这安排真是悄无声息出人意料啊
Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?

160
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,050
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

161
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,190
那其实不叫问题
Let's not call it a problem.

162
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,380
我们应该称其为"机会"
Let's call it an opportunity.

163
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,060
一个解决严重问题的机会
To solve a serious problem.

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,600
我做错什么了
What did I do?

165
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,300
你不知道吗  可怜的小宝贝
You don't know? Oh, you poor dear.

166
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,630
你的卵巢把太多愚蠢分泌物
Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice

167
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,150
都送到你脑子  害你人都傻了
into your brains you don't even know which way is up.

168
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,950
你对霍夫斯塔德博士做出
You made an inappropriate sexual advance

169
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,470
-不恰当的性企图  -什么
- towards Dr. Hofstadter. - What?

170
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,430
我没有对任何人做任何性企图
I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.

171
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,740
别这么快就开始激动辩解
Now, there's no need to get defensive.

172
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,260
我对你的情况表示同情
I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.

173
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,490
我的父亲过去常说  女人就像
My father used to say that a woman

174
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,400
德州温暖天气中的鸡蛋沙拉三明治
is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.

175
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,430
什么意思
What?

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,860
鸡蛋[卵子]满满  诱惑短短[容易坏]
Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.

177
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,560
这次谈话让我觉得很不舒服
This conversation is making me uncomfortable.

178
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,180
不止你  我也是  妹妹
Yeah, you and me both, sister.

179
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,310
现在
Now,

180
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,320
请你明白
please understand...

181
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,880
你的行为  我并不觉得是你的错
I don't hold you responsible for your behavior

182
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,050
因为从进化的角度看
because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint,

183
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,970
你不过是自身繁殖欲望的奴隶
you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.

184
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,760
但在工作时间
But during the work day,

185
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,050
当你觉得自己有求欢的意图时
when you feel possessed by amorous intent,

186
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,100
我能否建议你
may I suggest that you suppress it

187
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,950
通过翻阅这本性传播疾病的绘本
by leafing through this illustrated book

188
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,340
来抑制住你的欲望
of sexually transmitted diseases?

189
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,750
我们看一下  就这页
Let's see here. Oh, yes.

190
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
你看看这张小恶心图片
Check out this oozy doozy.

191
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,790
我要走了
I have to go.

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,130
这位仁兄也是
So does this fellow,

193
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,010
但他走不了  他那里就跟热汤那样烧得慌
but he can't without it burning like hot soup.

194
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,090
嗨  美女
Hey, pretty lady.

195
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,010
你看起来格外开心啊
Oh, you seem extra happy.

196
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,010
应该是吧
Uh, I guess I am.

197
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,680
有什么特别的原因吗
Any particular reason why?

198
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,760
不知道  就是今天过得还不错
Mm, I don't know, just having a good day.

199
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,830
早上谢尔顿在去上班的路上睡着了
This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work,

200
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,800
所以我有机会听广播
so I got to listen to the radio--

201
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
好疯狂的一早
that was pretty crazy.

202
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,150
还有别的吗
Anything else?

203
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,180
我在网上发现一个小测试
I found this quiz online called

204
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,610
名叫"测测你是星际迷航中的谁"
"Which Star Trek Character Are You?"

205
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,910
我测了四次  终于测到柯克船长[角色]
and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.

206
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,410
很好啊
That's great.

207
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,390
的确如此
Oh. It. Was.

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,420
很高兴你今天过得这么开心
Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.

209
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,820
还有一件让我更开心的事就是
And the one thing that could make it even better

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,990
晚上要跟我特别的姑娘约会
is an evening with my special girl.

211
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,160
哪一个啊
Oh, and who's that?

212
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,830
这话什么意思
What do you mean?

213
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,460
我不知道特别的姑娘  是指我还是艾利克斯
Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.

214
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,520
为什么会指艾利克斯
Um, why would I mean Alex?

215
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,730
因为我知道她对你有意思
Because I know she hit on you

216
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,860
而且我还知道你很暗爽
and I know you liked it!

217
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,920
哪里...有
What...?

218
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,880
别跟老娘装傻  里卡多·谢利沙力
Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!

219
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,030
我是不是漏了什么事
I'm missing something.

220
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,320
你是不是跟佩妮说了艾利克斯的事
Did you say something to Penny about Alex?

221
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
没错  而且还得到了"很多帮助"呢
Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me.

222
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,970
"帮助"就是她光顾着生你的气了
All she did was get mad at you.

223
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,840
你为什么要这样做
Why would you do that?

224
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,950
我需要关于女人的建议
I needed advice about a woman.

225
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,130
我本来可以问你的
I would have asked you,

226
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,420
但要说过去几年证明了什么
but if the last few years have proven anything,

227
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,090
那就是你连子宫和独轮车都分不清
it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.

228
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,460
至少我知道随便对女生透露
At least I know not to blab to a girl

229
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,870
有人追她男友是不对的
about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.

230
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,530
知道这个太好了
Good to know.

231
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,080
你再多说点这类的金玉良言
Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that,

232
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,920
就可以名正言顺地加入姐妹顾问团了
you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.

233
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
你好
Hello.

234
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,610
这样啊
I see.

235
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,520
几点
Uh, what time?

236
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,320
好的
Very well, then.

237
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,920
是学校的人事部打来的
That was the Human Resources Department at the university.

238
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,480
我的助理艾利克斯居然投诉了我
Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint

239
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,890
说我在办公场所有不当行为
accusing me of inappropriate behavior in the workplace.

240
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,610
老天啊  你做了什么
Oh, my God, what did you do?

241
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,840
我回忆一下
Hmm, let me think.

242
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,420
没什么啊  我超萌超有爱的
Nothing. I'm a delight.

243
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
人事部
Human Resources Department.

244
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,210
人事部
Human Resources Department.

245
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,080
人事部
Human Resources Department.

246
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,550
请进
Come in.

247
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,720
你好
Hello.

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
是你啊  库珀博士  请坐吧
Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.

249
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,070
谢谢
Thank you.

250
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,330
我今天叫你来是因为你的助理
I called you in today because your assistant

251
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,970
艾利克斯·詹森投诉了你
Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.

252
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,360
我听说了
So I've been told.

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,310
但我不明白她有什么可抱怨的
But I can't understand what she has to complain about.

254
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,880
她处在见证我改写科学界历史的最前线
I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.

255
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,370
我的迷你冰箱里随时备有奶酪棒
There's string cheese in my mini-fridge,

256
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,590
大家都可以享用
and that's for anyone.

257
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,250
而且就在昨天
Yeah, and just yesterday

258
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,510
我向她展示染上妇科病的生殖器图片
I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity

259
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,590
指引她走出了淫乱的歧途
by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.

260
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,970
取消下一位的面谈
Cancel my next appointment.

261
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,070
这位估计得耗点时间
This is gonna take a while.

262
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,350
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper,

263
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,920
你对你的下属
you said things to your employee

264
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,580
说了在职场上不应该说的话
that you just cannot say in the workplace.

265
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,220
比如什么
Like what?

266
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,850
据詹森女士说
Well, according to Ms. Jensen,

267
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,430
你说她是自己生理需求的奴隶
you said that she was a slave to her biological urges

268
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,590
并且称呼她为"鸡蛋沙拉三明治"
and called her an "egg salad sandwich."

269
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,760
虽然我不知道那是什么比喻
I don't even know what that means,

270
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,080
但我告诉你  说那种话是不行的
but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.

271
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,980
我明白怎么会有误会了
Oh! I see the confusion here.

272
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,510
艾利克斯以为我在针对她  不是这样的
No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No.

273
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,730
我的意思是所有女人
I meant that all women

274
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,530
都是自己生理需求的奴隶
are slaves to their biological urges, you know?

275
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,300
你也一样
Even you.

276
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,160
你是个奴隶
You're a slave.

277
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,130
我是什么来着
I'm a what?

278
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,670
我的意思是
Well, y-you... I-I'm just saying, you know,

279
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,670
在女性生理周期的某一时刻
at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle...

280
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,060
停停停
Whuh-ah!

281
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,030
这也是你不能谈论的  库珀博士
You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper.

282
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,260
你的语言非常不恰当
Your language is entirely inappropriate,

283
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,920
我建议立刻给我闭嘴
and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.

284
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,940
我真不明白被指责的怎么会是我
I d... I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here.

285
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,860
霍夫斯塔德博士  每抓到一个听众
Dr. Hofstadter-- he was bragging about

286
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,620
他就要炫耀自己有多风靡女性万千
his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen.

287
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,500
还有霍华德·沃罗威茨
You know, and Howard Wolowitz--

288
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,230
他花了两年时间  利用学校的资源
he spent two years using university resources

289
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,920
制造了一个六乳性爱机器人
building a six-breasted sex robot.

290
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,920
我还在部门的圣诞派对里
And at the office Christmas party,

291
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,160
听到拉杰什·库萨帕里
I heard Rajesh Koothrappali

292
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,770
好几次称你为"棕糖美妞"
refer to you several times as "brown sugar."

293
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,930
霍夫斯塔德
Hofstadter...

294
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,040
沃罗威茨
Wolowitz...

295
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,830
最后一个是拉杰什·库萨帕里
and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?

296
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,150
是的
Yes.

297
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,570
对  但我得为他澄清一下
No, yeah, but in his defense,

298
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,770
他不是对你有种族歧视
that wasn't racist.

299
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,740
他也是棕皮肤人种
He's also brown.

300
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,210
* 抱歉艾利克斯喜欢我 *
* Sorry Alex hit on me *

301
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,640
* 喜欢我 *
* Hit on me *

302
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,610
* 喜欢我 *
* Hit on me *

303
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,090
* 抱歉艾利克斯喜欢我 *
* Sorry Alex hit on me *

304
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,670
* 我不知道自己很讨喜 *
* I'd no idea I'm cute *

305
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
可恶  你确实讨喜
Oh, damn it, you are.

306
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,970
原谅我吧
Please forgive me.

307
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,010
我应该早点告诉你艾利克斯的事
I should have told you about Alex.

308
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,000
我不在乎她
I don't care about Alex.

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,410
好吧  我在乎
Fine, I care.

310
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,180
好吧  我讨厌那小贱人
Okay, I hate that bitch.

311
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,290
但你竟然那么暗爽  太让我难过了
But what really hurt is that you liked it so much.

312
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,950
我需要担心你变心吗
I mean, do I need to be worried?

313
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,770
当然不用啦  担心什么啊
Of course not. No. Why?

314
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,130
因为她又漂亮又聪明
Because...she is pretty and smart,

315
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,980
你们要是谈论工作的东西  她不必跑回家
and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home

316
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,990
翻翻字典才能理解你在说什么
and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.

317
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,600
-你会那样做啊  -才不会
- You do that? - No.

318
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,370
等一下  你是没有安全感吗
Hang on. Are you feeling insecure?

319
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,510
那可是我专属的事
Because that's my thing,

320
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,230
要是你把这个活抢走了
and if you take it away,

321
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,500
那我们的关系之中  我就贡献不出东西了
I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.

322
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,680
对  莱纳德  我没安全感
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure.

323
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,100
-开心吗  -不
- Happy? - No,

324
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,280
不开心
I'm not happy.

325
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,220
-那你干嘛笑  -对不起嘛
- Why are you smiling? - I'm sorry.

326
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,580
我从没想过你会有这种感觉
I just never think of you having feelings like that.

327
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,430
-我有的  -为什么呢
- Well, I do. - Why?

328
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,790
我和艾利克斯绝对没可能
Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.

329
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,630
很好
Good.

330
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,840
过来
Come here.

331
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,390
-告诉你个秘密吧  -什么
- I'll tell you a secret? - What's that?

332
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,600
有这么多姑娘追我
With all these women chasing me,

333
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,260
我觉得自己好像柯克船长
I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.

334
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,290
-我也能说个秘密吗  -当然
- Can I tell you a secret? - Sure.

335
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,640
继续说什么柯克船长吧
Keep talking about Captain Kirk,

336
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,040
估计我们撑得过今天撑不过明天
and we're all gonna stop.

337
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,540
信息  已收到[模仿柯克船长]
Message... received.

338
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,880
不好意思
Ah, excuse me.

339
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,740
你好
Hello.

340
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,930
我是霍夫斯塔德博士
This is Dr. Hofstadter.

341
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,170
好的
Okay.

342
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,660
知道了  谢谢
All right, thank you.

343
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,210
奇了怪了
That's weird.

344
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,160
人事部叫我过去一趟
I'm getting called in to Human Resources.

345
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,990
你做了什么了
What did you do?

346
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,310
我不知道
I don't know.

347
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,380
人事部刚刚叫我过去一趟
I just got called in to Human Resources.

348
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,160
-为什么  -不知道
- Why? - I don't know.

349
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,190
真是太奇怪了
That is so strange.

350
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,360
人事部叫我明天过去一趟
Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.

351
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,850
你能不能停下"孤菊自舔"两分钟啊
Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes?

352
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,360
老子现在有麻烦
I have a problem here.

353
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,340
你真觉得现在是喝酒的好时机吗
Do you really think you should be drinking right now?

354
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,920
不然我等会怎么回答人事部小姐的问题
How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?

355
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,930
不知道  看心理医生怎么样
I don't know. Seek professional help?

356
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,660
我有啊  酒类专卖店的人说
I did. The guy at the liquor store said

357
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,300
这玩意配咖啡口感不错
this stuff tastes great in coffee.

358
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,020
等下  你也被召来了吗
Wait, you got called in, too?

359
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,250
出什么事了
What is going on?

360
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,280
谢尔顿把我们都拉来陪葬了
Sheldon threw us all under the bus.

361
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
我感觉自己像是见校长的坏学生
I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office.

362
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,390
不过我可不介意被"棕糖美妞"打屁屁
Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.

363
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,840
还是在性爱秋千上打哦
From a sex swing!

364
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,670
喝酒可能是个错误决定
This may have been a mistake.

365
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,660
放轻松  没事的
Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.

366
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,940
要知道在我碰到伯纳黛特前
You know, before I met Bernadette

367
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,660
我是这里三天两头报到的常客
I was in here every other day.

368
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,000
友情提示下
Uh, little tip:

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,680
进去前先把"我喜欢大屁妞"的铃声调成静音
turn off your "I Like Big Butts" ringtone before you go in.

370
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,310
这都是你的错
Well, this is all your fault.

371
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,690
怎么成我的错了
How is this my fault?

372
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,970
如果你没和谢尔顿的助理鬼混
If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant,

373
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,010
根本不会发生现在这种破事
none of this would be happening.

374
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,760
我才没跟任何人鬼混
I wasn't screwing around with anyone.

375
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,930
是哦  没有
Oh, of course not.

376
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,580
那你是想说  她在"闻你的货时"
She was just sniffing around your goods

377
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,880
只是单纯在找松露而已吗[靠猪的嗅觉找]
because she was hunting for truffles.

378
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,050
沃罗威茨先生  好久不见
Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.

379
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,640
你好  洁宁
Hey, Janine.

380
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,990
汤姆和孩子们好吗
How are Tom and the kids?

381
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,410
很好
Fine.

382
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,130
你一定是霍夫斯塔德博士吧
You must be Dr. Hofstadter.

383
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,860
是  但我想这是个天大的误会
Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.

384
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,650
你也误会我了
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

385
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,580
我什么都没干
I didn't do anything.

386
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,230
你怎么说话满嘴酒气
Is that alcohol on your breath?

387
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,410
霍华德造了个性爱机器人
Howard built a sex robot.

388
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,370
没有这回事
That is not true.

389
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,230
我就只是造了个机器人而已
All I did was build a robot.

390
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,310
你那个机器人有六个胸吗
Did it have six breasts?

391
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,710
抱歉  我是个尊重男女平等的人
I'm sorry, I'm a feminist--

392
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,110
我不会特别注意
I don't notice things like

393
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,960
机器人有多少乳房这种事
how many breasts a robot has.

394
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,610
大家好
Well, hello.

395
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,900
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

396
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,950
我是来找戴维斯夫人的
Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.

397
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,350
我现在有点忙
And I'm a little busy right now.

398
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,900
我是来投诉的
But I came to file a complaint.

399
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,370
有人在工作场所通过用不当的
Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace

400
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,460
和带性字眼的言语骚扰我  让我觉得不适
by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.

401
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,680
是谁呢
And who was that?

402
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,750
就你啊  你这色色的婆娘
You, you dirty birdie.

403
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,970
我回想了下你昨天跟我说过的话
I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday,

404
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,340
我意识到那是对我深深的冒犯
and I realized I'm deeply offended.

405
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,250
现在乖乖去给本大爷拿投诉表来
Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.

406
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,960
够了
That's it.

407
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,390
所有人  马上进我办公室
All of you, in my office now!

408
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,860
多亏你的"教导"  我不至于傻到问
And thanks to you, I know better than to ask

409
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,040
你是不是来"大姨妈"了
if you're menstruating.

410
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,440
而看你这狂躁样  不问也知道
And based on your behavior, I don't have to.

411
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,190
经过训示后  我才明白
It has been pointed out to me that...

412
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,080
我对你说的某些话
some of the things I said to you

413
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
可能会被理解成  无礼
could be construed as... offensive,

414
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,730
我愿意向你表达
and I would like to offer you

415
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,710
我最真诚的歉意
my sincerest apology.

416
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,190
-谢谢  库珀博士  -另外
- Thank you, Dr. Cooper. - Yeah, additionally,

417
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,040
跟你说下  校方要求我
you should know that the university has mandated

418
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,290
参加在线性骚扰研讨班
that I take an online sexual harassment seminar

419
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,380
这样以后不会再发生类似的事情
so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.

420
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,740
-好的  -现在
- Okay. - Yeah. Now,

421
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,950
遗憾的是  我的时间太过宝贵
unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable

422
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,430
不能浪费在这种屁事上面
to waste on nonsense like this,

423
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,930
所以  我需要你替我考过这个测试
so... um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me.

424
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,160
还有  你最好给我得个A
Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it--

425
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
因为校方还挺生气的
they're pretty mad.

426
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,560
我一直在想你和艾利克斯的事
So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.

427
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,440
拜托你别再为这个烦心了
Oh, would you stop worrying about that?

428
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,280
我也没办法  但我想着
I can't help it. But, look, I figured

429
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,880
我可以不作为  一直觉得没安全感
I could sit around and feel insecure,

430
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,630
或者也可以做出行动
or I could do something about it.

431
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,430
所以我拿了学校的课程表
So I got a course catalog at school

432
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,970
看下了科学类课程
and looked at some of the science classes.

433
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,740
太好了
That's great.

434
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,720
一点也不好  那些课都闷死了
No, it isn't-- they are extremely boring.

435
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,310
你怎么撑到现在还没有自杀
I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?

436
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,530
话说回来  我觉得我没必要做科学家
Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist,

437
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,980
我只要看起来像就行
I could just look like one.

438
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,510
所以我买了这个
So I bought these.

439
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,050
眼镜
Glasses?

440
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,520
我不觉得这会有什么帮助...
I really don't think that's gonna change--

441
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,240
我的天啊
oh, my God,

442
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,880
你看起来真是聪明绝顶兼性感撩人
you look so smart and hot!

443
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,610
我知道  瞧好啦
I know, right? Watch this.

444
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,970
分子
Molecules.

445
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,390
跟我来吧
Okay, come with me.

446
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,410
-去哪里  -我的卧室
- Where are we going? - To my bedroom,

447
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,060
这样我可以扒光你除了眼镜外的一切衣物
so I can take everything off but those glasses...

448
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,400
靴子也留着好了
and maybe the boots.
