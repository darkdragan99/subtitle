1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,090
操作界面很简单
The interface is pretty simple.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,370
你把横坐标"X"值输在这里
You put your horizontal "X" coordinate here,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,410
纵坐标"Y"值输入这里
vertical "Y" coordinate here.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,740
等数值让你满意了  就可以按下发射按钮
When you're happy with those, you press this button.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,930
懂了
Got it.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,220
莱纳德  你肯定猜不到我在网上找到了谁
Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online--

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,240
瞄得真准
Nice shot.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,630
都是他大头的功劳
Eh, his giant head did most of the work.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,740
真是"成熟"啊
Very mature.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,250
算你们走运  我现在不玩那种喷彩摩丝了
You're lucky I'm out of Silly String.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,070
我刚才是说  莱纳德
As I was saying, Leonard,

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,050
你肯定猜不到我在网上找到了谁
you'll never guess who I just found online:

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,550
质子教授
Professor Proton.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,770
开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,010
-他居然还健在  -没错
- He's still alive? - Yes!

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,370
谁是质子教授
Who's Professor Proton?

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,650
他是一档超棒节目的主持人...
He was the host of this great--

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,340
太棒了
Yes!

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,280
抱歉  跟我说说质子教授
Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,040
质子教授是我小时候最爱看的
Professor Proton hosted my favorite science show

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,100
一档科学节目的主持人
when I was a child.

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,550
我从未落下过一集
I never missed an episode.

23
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,040
他通过利用日常用品来实践科学原理
He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,360
超级酷的
It was pretty cool.

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,640
你错用"酷"来形容傻事的时候真可爱
Aw, so cute when you use the word "Cool" wrong.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,610
小孩就常把"意大利面"说错成"大意利面"
Like when kids say "pasghetti."

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,480
天啊
Oh, dear Lord!

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,430
莱纳德  快看
Leonard, look!

29
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,260
还能请他出席聚会或其他场合
He's still available for parties and events.

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,590
我们应该请他来
We should hire him.

31
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,210
请他来干嘛
Hire him to do what?

32
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,910
做任何我们想做的事
Well, whatever we want.

33
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,960
一起玩  做实验
Hang out, do experiments,

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,350
跟他拍12张不同的照片
make him take 12 pictures with us

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,580
然后做成日历
so we can make a calendar.

36
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,870
能跟他一起玩一定超级棒
It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him.

37
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,560
我也错用"超级棒"这词了  对吗
I just used "awesome" wrong, didn't I?

38
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,980
我现在就发邮件给他
Well, I'm E-mailing him right now.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,340
你还记得他节目的主题曲吗
Do you remember his old theme song?

40
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,700
当然记得
Of course I do.

41
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,150
* 拿起你的护目镜  穿上你的实验袍 *
* Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on *

42
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,930
* 质子教授  大驾光临 *
* Here he comes, Professor Proton.*

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,700
生活大爆炸 第六季  第二十二集

44
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,800
我刚发现我这周末
Hey, I just found out I have to be at

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
都得待在望远镜实验室
the telescope lab all weekend.

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,120
你和伯纳黛特能照顾下我的狗狗吗
Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,790
你何不直接把她关进狗笼里
Why don't you put her in a kennel?

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,480
你何不把你妈送去养老院
Why don't you put your mother in a home?

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,110
老实说  她更适合关笼子里
To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel.

50
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,840
我会跟妮妮说  应该没问题
I'll talk to Bernie. I'm sure it's fine.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,500
谢谢你
Thank you.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,430
美梦成真了  美梦成真了
It's happening! It's happening!

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,560
质子教授要来我们家了
Professor Proton is coming to our house.

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
真的假的
You're kidding!

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,070
你是说那个主持白痴儿童节目的人吗
You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?

56
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,000
就凭你这句话  你被拒之门外了
And you just got yourself uninvited.

57
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,910
瞧  我就说我能巧妙地踢开他
See? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.

58
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,580
你怎么能让他去你家
How'd you get him to come to your house?

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,700
质子教授曾经说过
As Professor Proton always says,

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,950
"世上无难事
"There is no problem you can't solve

61
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,380
-只怕有脑人"  -他花钱请的
- if you use your noggin." - And he wrote him a check.

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,410
对  没错  花大钱哟
Yeah, that, too. Big check.

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,420
霍华德叔叔
Uncle Howard!

64
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,940
小肉桂来你家过夜啦
Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party!

65
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,260
你知道如果你中风倒下  她会把你吃掉  对吧
You know if you had a stroke, she'd eat you, right?

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,220
我很乐意成为她的美食
And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,940
好吧  我该怎么照顾她
Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?

68
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,210
很简单
It's very simple.

69
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,720
早餐她要吃蛋白菜肉馅煎饼
For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata.

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
可以给她吃自制薯条
Feel free to give her a choice

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,300
或是英式松饼  但不能两样都给她吃
of home fries or an English muffin, but not both.

72
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,770
我们在一起控制体重嘛
We're watching our weight.

73
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,050
正餐的话  可以随便吃点
Uh, for dinner, something simple--

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,970
一份小牛排  几个虾  随便什么都行
a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.

75
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,920
-真高贵的狗狗  -没错
- Classy dog. - Yes.

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,100
对了  别忘了关厕所门
Also, don't forget to close the toilet

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,320
不让她会把马桶的水喝光的
or she'll drink out of it.

78
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,670
我深感同情
I feel for ya.

79
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,220
因为我也有一个疯子老妈
I've got a psychotic mommy, too.

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,130
莱纳德  你睡觉了吗
Leonard, are you in bed?

81
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,020
-睡了  -我也是
- Yes. - Me, too.

82
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,250
很好
Great.

83
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,820
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

84
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,140
我睡得着  麻烦别吵我
Well, I can, so shut up.

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,120
你知道还有不到九个小时
Do you realize that in less than nine hours,

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,060
亚瑟·杰弗里斯  也就是质子教授
Arthur Jeffries, a.k.a. Professor Proton,

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,630
将会大驾光临我们的公寓吗
will be in our apartment?

88
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,850
谢尔顿  你知道如果你整夜不睡觉
Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night,

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,410
你明天就会犯困
you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow.

90
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,610
犯困的谢尔顿就会变狂躁古怪
And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon.

91
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,050
而狂躁古怪的谢尔顿
And a cranky Sheldon...

92
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,890
其实跟平时的谢尔顿也没什么区别
is actually no different than a regular Sheldon.

93
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,830
晚安
Good night!

94
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,460
我在考虑明天穿燕尾服
I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.

95
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,700
那一点也不可笑  晚安
That's not ridiculous. Good night.

96
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,980
你有袖扣吗
Do you have cufflinks?

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,630
-没有  -无所谓了
- No. - Ah, just as well.

98
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,440
反正凌晨3点也借不到燕尾服
Where can you rent a tuxedo 3:00 in the morning?

99
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,530
好吧  晚安
Okay, good night.

100
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,670
很高兴见到您  质子教授
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

101
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,460
很高兴见到您  质子教授
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

102
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,290
很高兴见到您  质子教授
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

103
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,130
很高兴见到您  质子...
Nice to meet you, Prof...

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,320
莱纳德
Leonard?

105
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,460
又干嘛
What?

106
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,440
我还是睡不着
I still can't sleep.

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,940
今天在公园真是把这小家伙累坏了
She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,470
是啊  你们俩一起玩的时候真可爱
Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.

109
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,080
玩扔球游戏时
It was kind of fun throwing a ball

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,880
没人笑我的感觉真好
and not having anyone laugh at me.

111
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,160
你真贴心  没把球扔太远
And you were sweet not to throw it too far

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
是怕她的小短腿捣腾坏了吧
so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,730
是啊  我扔得近完全是出于担心
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,060
今天有些时候
You know, there were a few moments today

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,300
我几乎觉得我们就是个小家庭
when I almost felt like we were a little family.

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,670
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

117
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,190
我从来没想过要当一位母亲
I never thought of myself as a mom,

118
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,750
但当今天我们仨在外面一起玩时
but when the three of us were out there having fun,

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,110
我觉得或许某天我们真的可以建立个小家庭
I felt like maybe someday we could do it.

120
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,290
我们当然可以
Of course we can.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
尤其是如果我们的宝宝也这么乖这么安静
Especially if our baby's as calm and quiet

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,330
就像这位小公主一样...
as little Cinna...

123
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,080
我勒个去  她不见了
Son of a bitch, she's gone!

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
她去哪里了
Where'd she go?!

125
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,760
我怎么知道  她又没有留个条
I don't know! She didn't leave a note!

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,970
不是你负责
You were the one who was supposed

127
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,370
把她放进婴儿车的吗
to put her back in the stroller!

128
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,480
才不是我  是你啊
No, I wasn't! You were!

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,860
-不是我  -就是你
- No, I wasn't! - Yes, you were!

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,600
好吧  你个弱鸡扔球像个娘们
Yeah, well, you throw like a girl!

131
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,300
我开始担心了
I'm getting worried.

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,480
别紧张  谢尔顿  他就晚到几分钟而已
Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,600
质子教授上电视时  从来不会迟到
Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV.

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,730
每天准时4点打开电视都能看见他
You know, every day, 4:00, he was there.

135
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,100
除非龙卷风在东德克萨斯肆虐
Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas,

136
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,600
这样的话  我们只能边看他边看新闻插播
in which case, we'd join him in progress.

137
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,830
是他打来的
It's him.

138
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,220
您好
Hello.

139
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,780
我明白
Well, I see.

140
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,640
好的
Yes.

141
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,860
没问题  我们可以去接您
All right, we can come get you.

142
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,280
好的  一会见
Yeah, well, see you soon.

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,150
-再见  -他在那里
- Bye. - Where is he?

144
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,720
三楼平台那
The third floor landing.

145
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,710
那可怜的老头爬楼梯爬了半个小时
The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour.

146
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
真的是你
It's really you.

147
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,700
杰弗里斯先生  真的很抱歉
Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry.

148
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,030
我们应该提前告诉你电梯坏了
We should've told you about the broken elevator.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,060
我同意
I agree.

150
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,070
质子教授  很荣幸见到你
Professor Proton, it's an honor to meet you.

151
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,280
叫我亚瑟就行
Just-just call me Arthur.

152
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
莱纳德
Leonard...

153
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,170
你听见了吗
...you hear that?

154
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,010
质子教授让我直呼他名字
Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur.

155
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,270
这意味着我们是朋友了
That means we're friends.

156
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,640
不是
No.

157
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,900
是朋友就会先告诉我电梯坏了
A friend would've-would've told me about the elevator.

158
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,630
快看我
Look at me.

159
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,200
我想离你多近就多近
I can get as close to you as I want

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,130
妈妈再也不用担心我的眼睛会坏掉
without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.

161
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,360
他是不是个危险人物
Is, uh, is he dangerous?

162
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,300
其实他是个天才人物
Actually, he's a genius.

163
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,030
真的哦
I am.

164
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,900
你没有正面回答我的问题
Th-That doesn't answer my question.

165
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,410
杰弗里斯先生  我是莱纳德
Mr. Jeffries, I'm-I'm Leonard.

166
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,880
这位是我的女朋友  佩妮
This is my girlfriend, Penny.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,430
-您好  -你好呀
- Hi. - Hello.

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,750
希望我没让
Well, I hope I haven't kept

169
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,590
楼上的孩子们等太久
the kids waiting too long for-for the show.

170
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,340
不  楼上没有孩子
Oh, no, there are no kids.

171
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,520
我是你唯一的观众
No, the-the show's for me.

172
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,440
走吧  比比看谁先上去
Come on. I'll race ya...

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
亚瑟
Arthur.

174
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,300
这位金发女郎真的是你的女朋友吗
Is the, is the blonde girl really your-your girlfriend?

175
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,530
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

176
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,770
你才是天才
You're the genius.

177
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,740
您经常出席像这样的场合吗
So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?

178
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,280
不好说
It-It's hard to say.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,840
我至今还在琢磨
I'm-I'm still trying to figure out what...

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,870
你们到底请我来干嘛
what-what this is.

181
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,150
我们只是想跟你一起玩
We just wanted to hang out with you

182
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,600
或许了解下你的人生
and maybe learn a little about your life.

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,810
其实没什么好说的
Well, there-there really isn't too much to tell.

184
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,350
自从电视节目取消后
After the TV show was-was canceled,

185
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,650
科学界没有人
nobody in the scientific world

186
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,460
把我当真正的科学家
would, uh, would take me seriously.

187
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,300
所以为了维持生计
So I was forced to do these,

188
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,410
我只好出席一些儿童聚会
uh, children's parties to-to make a living.

189
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,470
真是太糟糕了
That's too bad.

190
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,900
但跟孩子们一起  肯定也有收获吧
But still, working with kids-- it must be rewarding.

191
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,800
常会被小孩咬
You-you get bit a lot.

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,400
看看我是否理解了
Let me see if-if I have this straight.

193
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,750
你们俩是物理学家
You-you two are-are physicists,

194
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,530
而你们请我来
and-and you, and you want me

195
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,360
是想让我表演一个儿童科学节目
to do a children's... science show?

196
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,220
是的
Yes.

197
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,430
如果有多余的时间
And if there's time,

198
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,530
麻烦跟我们拍12张不同季节不同着装的照片
take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,950
我是个真正的科学家呢
You know, I'm a real scientist.

200
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,980
我是康乃尔大学的博士
I-I have a PhD from Cornell University.

201
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,740
那很棒啊
Yeah, that's great.

202
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,650
你有带你的玩偶来吗
Did you bring your puppet?

203
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,310
没有
No, no.

204
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,370
我讨厌那个玩偶
I-I hate that puppet.

205
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,520
不会吧
Oh, no.

206
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,630
怎么会有人讨厌
How could anybody hate

207
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,880
中微子基诺呢
Gino the Neutrino?

208
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
很棒吧
It's nice, huh?

209
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
我在易趣上买的  20块
I got him for 20 bucks on eBay.

210
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,890
还包邮哦  亲
Including a-shipping!

211
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,150
这不是梦  对吗
I'm... I'm awake, right?

212
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,230
这一切都真实在发生
Th-This is happening?

213
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,950
小肉桂
Cinnamon!

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,770
小肉桂
Cinnamon!

215
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,610
她没有回应可能是因为
You know, maybe she doesn't recognize her name

216
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,690
我们没用拉杰的口音
because of Raj's accent.

217
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,910
这想法靠谱
Good thinking.

218
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,150
小肉桂  到爸爸碗里来
Cinnamon, come to Daddy!

219
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,650
小肉桂
Cinnamon!

220
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,370
我的小羊排  你在哪呢
Where are you, my little lamb chop?

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,690
-惟妙惟肖啊  -谢谢
- Nice. - Thanks.

222
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,430
这事完了以后  别把那嗓音忘了
When this all blows over, remember that voice.

223
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,640
挺让我性趣盎然的
It's kind of a turn-on.

224
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,500
我学拉杰说话会让你兴奋吗
It turns you on when I sound like Raj?

225
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,080
小肉桂
Cinnamon!

226
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,100
我把鸡蛋放在上面
Okay, as-as I put the egg on top,

227
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,510
等火焰熄灭
and-and the flame goes out

228
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,680
烧瓶里的气压减小
and-and the air pressure decreases in-in the flask,

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,010
你们认为会发生什么
what do you think will happen?

230
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,030
我好像知道
I think I know.

231
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,870
鸡蛋会被吸进去
It's gonna get sucked in.

232
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,180
它会被吸进去
It's going to get sucked in.

233
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,940
好吧  我不知道
Okay, I didn't know.

234
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,370
答对了
Yes!

235
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,270
瞧  我不是他们那种科学家
See, I'm not a scientist like them.

236
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,530
我发现了
I-I figured that out.

237
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,720
利用原电池原理  让土豆发电

238
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,020
土豆钟  做土豆钟的实验吧
Uh, potato clock. Do potato clock.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,330
那是什么
What's that?

240
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,970
用土豆给钟充电
I-I power a clock with a, with a potato.

241
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,200
不可能吧
Shut up!

242
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,220
还能这样啊
You can do that?

243
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,590
我是说
I mean...

244
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,550
这样不就能解决世界能源危机了吗
wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?

245
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,080
还真不能
No.

246
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,200
伙计们
Look, guys,

247
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,110
留着你们的钱  我觉得
keep your money. I-I think, uh...

248
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,880
我觉得我该走了
I-I think I'm done.

249
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,460
怎么了
What-what's wrong?

250
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,690
是她惹你生气了吗
Is she upsetting you?

251
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,820
我可以让她走的
Because I can make her go away.

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,000
我是看在她的面子上才待这么久的
No, sh-she's the only reason I've-I've stayed this long.

253
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,430
那是为什么
Then what is it?

254
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,360
我也不知道
I don't know.

255
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,260
我觉得我只是
I think I'm just...

256
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,670
只是不想
I-I just, I just don't want to be

257
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,460
再当质子教授了
Professor Proton anymore.

258
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,010
你怎么能说这种话
Well, how can you say that?

259
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,830
质子教授最棒了
Professor Proton's the best.

260
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,360
我可不这么想
What-what has it ever gotten me?

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,620
我都是83岁的老头了
I mean, I'm-I'm an 83-year-old man who has...

262
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,910
箱子里还放着土豆
potatoes in-in his suitcase.

263
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,560
其他科学家把我视为笑柄
Other scientists think-think I'm a joke.

264
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,580
还有
And the...

265
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,300
负责操控基诺的木偶师
the puppeteer who did, who did Gino...

266
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,970
他也...
well, he also...

267
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,000
"操"控了我老婆
did my wife.

268
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,220
杰弗里斯先生
Mr. Jeffries,

269
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,780
我得给你看点东西
I need to show you something.

270
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,250
对于你的痛苦  我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.

271
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,510
谢谢
Uh, thanks.

272
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,970
如果你不介意的话
But if you don't mind me asking,

273
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,880
我想问问土豆钟是怎么运作的
the potato clock, how does it work?

274
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,170
是钟有猫腻  还是土豆有猫腻
Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?

275
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,390
你们俩平时都交流些啥
Wh-What do you two talk about?

276
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,290
我小时候在德克萨斯给你写过一封信
I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas,

277
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,450
你送了我这个有你亲笔签名的照片
and you sent this autographed picture back to me.

278
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,790
还记得吗
Do you remember that?

279
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,990
我给你个提示吧
I'll-I'll give you a hint:

280
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,580
我平时戴着写着自己的地址的手链[老人痴呆]
I have a bracelet with my own address on it.

281
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,320
总之
Well, anyway, um,

282
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,100
你可能觉得难以置信
you may find this hard to believe,

283
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,530
但其实我从小到大没什么朋友
but I didn't have any friends growing up.

284
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,730
这我完全理解
No, I-I get that.

285
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,540
但是  我有你
But, um, I did have you.

286
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,420
每天下午四点钟
And every day at 4:00,

287
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,190
我在家看你在68频道的节目
you'd come to my house on Channel 68,

288
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,710
我们都一起玩科学游戏
and we'd do science together.

289
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,710
要不是你的话
If it hadn't been for you,

290
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,580
谁知道我现在会变成什么样
well, who knows what would've become of me?

291
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,170
我可能当不成世界一流的物理学家
You know? Instead of a world-class physicist,

292
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,440
而成为流浪汉
I could've wound up as a-a hobo.

293
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,130
或者外科医生
Or a surgeon.

294
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,360
我相信世上每天都有许多重要的科学发现
I bet there are important discoveries being made every day

295
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,290
这都归功于你启发了无数的孩子去追求科学
because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science.

296
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,840
从某种角度来说  他们的发现就是你的发现
In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.

297
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,770
是真的
Yeah, it's true.

298
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,990
整整一代年轻的科学家
A generation of young scientists

299
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,240
都是靠你启发才有了今天
are standing on your shoulders.

300
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,690
谢谢你们
Well, thank-thank you, guys.

301
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,560
这番话对我意义非凡
That... that-that means a lot.

302
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,900
你要知道你在我们心目中的份量  这很重要
Well, it's important you know how much you mean to us.

303
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,150
亚瑟  你还好吗
Arthur, are you okay?

304
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,430
我的
I'm having a...

305
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,040
心脏起搏器出了点问题
problem with my pacemaker.

306
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,740
我去叫救护车
I'll-I'll call for help.

307
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,660
用土豆来充电可以吗
Any chance we could plug it into the potato?

308
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,380
不行
No.

309
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,050
你好
Hello?

310
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,910
什么叫你找到我的狗了
What do you mean, you found my dog?

311
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,170
她在我朋友那儿呢
She's with my friends.

312
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,130
她还好吗
Is she okay?

313
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,350
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

314
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,080
把你的地址发给我  我这就来
Uh, just text me your address; I'm on my way.

315
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,650
如果她饿了的话  就给她喂点吃的
Oh, and if she's hungry, go ahead and feed her.

316
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,840
但别给她带淀粉的食物
But do not give her anything starchy.

317
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,860
它晚餐要吃意式调味饭
She's having risotto for dinner.

318
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,100
你的生命指数很稳定
Your vitals are stable,

319
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,330
但还是去医院做些检查  以防万一
but let's take you in for some tests just to be safe.

320
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,220
需要我们中的谁陪你坐救护车吗
You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?

321
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,820
我去
I'll do it!

322
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,490
他不是亲属  不能让他陪同  对吧
He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?

323
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,930
没这样的规矩  他可以去
No, that's not a rule. He can go.

324
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,210
太好了
Oh, yeah!

325
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,580
今天我连喘口气的机会都没有
I can't catch a break today.

326
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,250
我们收拾好你的东西  就去医院看你
We'll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.

327
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,280
很抱歉事情发展成这样
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

328
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,740
到了这个地步  我只能
Well, at-at this point, I'm just...

329
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,060
庆幸下楼时有人来抬我走
glad someone's carrying me down the stairs.

330
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,040
不仅见到我儿时的英雄
Met my childhood hero,

331
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,070
还能和他一起坐救护车
now I get to ride in an ambulance.

332
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,740
如果能再让他拍挂历照片
Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar,

333
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,590
这将是我人生中最美好的一天
this'll be the best day ever.

334
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,250
真不敢相信把她弄丢了
Can't believe we lost her.

335
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,250
我想什么呢
What was I thinking?

336
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,210
我会是个糟糕的母亲
I'd be a terrible mom.

337
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,930
或许第一个孩子时  你做得不够好
Well, maybe with the first one.

338
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,230
但孩子就跟煎薄饼一样
But kids are like pancakes.

339
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,330
第一个总是要扔掉的废品
The first one's always a throwaway.

340
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,310
-怎么样  -挺好的
- How's this look? - It's fine.

341
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,230
你哪弄来的她的照片
Where'd you get that picture of her?

342
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,860
这不是她
It's not her.

343
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,380
我只是谷歌了一下"被当亲生娃的狗"
I just Googled "Foo-foo little dogs."

344
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,160
是拉杰  别出声
It's Raj. Stay quiet.

345
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,530
真不凑巧
Bad timing.

346
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,150
伯纳黛特刚刚带小肉桂出门溜达了
Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.

347
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,820
有意思
Interesting.

348
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,000
他们溜到谎言巷了吗
Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?

349
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,560
什么
What?

350
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,220
说谎者出入的小巷
A lane frequented by liars.

351
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,490
比如说你  你这个大骗子
Like you, you big liar!

352
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,500
她居然在你那里
You have her?

353
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,490
谢天谢地她没事
Oh, thank God she's okay.

354
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,420
我相信你  你却让我失望了
Well, I trusted you, and you let me down.

355
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,960
可怜的小家伙抖了几小时了
The poor thing's been shaking for hours.

356
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,300
真是对不起
I'm really sorry.

357
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,330
等等  你已经找到它几小时了吗
Hang on, you've had her for hours?

358
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,740
对  我去接了它
Yes. I picked her up,

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,400
两人一起去做了个按摩  放松下来
and then we both went for massages to try and calm down.

360
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,340
然后去粉红桨果店吃了酸奶
And then we got Pinkberry.

361
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,420
你知道她没事
So you knew she was okay,

362
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,560
就不会接我们电话告诉我们吗
and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?

363
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,090
那个  我想...
Well, I-I thought about...

364
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,710
少跟我说废话  先生
Don't "well" me, mister!

365
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,050
我们快担心死了
We've been worried sick!

366
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,090
我们都觉得她已经不在人世了
She could have been dead for all we knew!

367
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,210
你应该觉得羞愧
You should be ashamed of yourself!

368
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,360
对不起  我只是
Sorry. I-I just...

369
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,450
道歉有什么用
Sorry's not good enough!

370
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,020
也许你应该花些时间
Maybe you need to take some time

371
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,760
好好反省下你的所作所为
and think about what you've done!

372
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
这招"良心不安"真高
Nice guilt trip.

373
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,530
你会是一个非常出色的妈妈
You are gonna be an amazing mom.

374

378
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,050
谢谢你  谢尔顿
Thank you, Sheldon.

379
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,800
唱得真好听
That-that was very nice.

380
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,760
-要我再唱一遍吗  -不用了
- Want me to sing it again? - No.

381
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,830
唱了四遍  四角俱全  很吉利了
The fourth, the fourth time was-was the charm.

382
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,680
需要我帮你拿点什么吗
There anything I can get for you?

383
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
苹果汁
Some apple juice?

384
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
果冻
Uh, some Jell-O?

385
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,980
不用了  多谢
No. No, thank you.

386
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,350
但我的确
But I-I do...

387
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,800
需要你帮个忙
I do have a favor to-to ask.

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
尽管说
Name it.

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,670
我明天有场表演
Well, I'm-I'm booked to do

390
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,580
要去参加一个儿童聚会
a children's party tomorrow,

391
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,520
说实话  我觉得我去不了
and, um, frankly I, you know, I-I don't feel up to it.

392
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,180
你肯定去不了
Oh, you're not.

393
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,200
你的样子糟糕极了
You look awful.

394
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,410
谢谢
Th-Thank you.

395
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,680
总之
Anyway, uh...

396
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,070
你比任何人都熟悉我的表演
I mean, you know my act better than... anybody.

397
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,180
我希望
I was, I was hoping

398
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,520
也许
that maybe, you know,

399
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,190
你可以替我去
maybe you'd fill in for me.

400
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,840
你是说
Wha... Are you saying

401
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,050
你要我当质子教授吗
that you want me to be Professor Proton?

402
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,250
对
Yeah.

403
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,360
天啊
Oh, my.

404
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,700
我太荣幸了
What an honor.

405
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,860
这就像是被邀请攀上奥林匹斯圣山
Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus

406
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,920
和众神同桌吃饭
and dine with the gods.

407
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,090
或与阿罕布拉市的一个韩国家庭同桌吃饭
Or a... Korean family in Alhambra.

408
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,720
但他们会知道我不是你
But they'll know I'm not you.

409
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,950
我是不是应该叫自己
Should I call myself...

410
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,710
小质子教授呢
Professor Proton, Jr.?

411
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,730
听起来挺好的
Sounds great.

412
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,150
那么  某种程度上
So, in a way...

413
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,640
感觉就像我是你的儿子
it's like I'm your son.

414
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,210
好...好吧
What-Whatever.

415
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,720
父亲
Father.

416
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,770
随便吧  爱咋地咋地
Sure, what the hell?
