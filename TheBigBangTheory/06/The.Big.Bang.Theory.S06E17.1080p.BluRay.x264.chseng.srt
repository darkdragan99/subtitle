00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,030
《生活大爆炸》前情回顾
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,120
请大家听我说几句
Can I have your attention, please?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,730
今晚我们齐聚一堂是因为
We're all here tonight

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,740
我们没有另一半相陪
because we have no one to be with.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,970
我们不能再以是否有恋爱对象
We've got to stop defining our self-worth

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,340
来定义我们的自我价值
by whether or not we're in a relationship.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,840
我们是一个联盟
We are a community,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,330
只要我们团结在一起
and as long as we have each other,

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,490
我们就不是寂寞的
we're never truly alone.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,190
你说的那些话真不错
That was cool. What you said.

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,060
谢谢
Thank you.

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,150
你想不想...
Uh... would you like to, uh...

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,610
去喝杯咖啡
get a cup... a cup of coffee...?

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,470
好的
Okay.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,830
哥先走一步了  废柴联盟
Later, losers!

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,530
事到如今

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,090
然后我去了剑桥  超美妙的时光
So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,340
不只是因为那是名校
not only because it's a good school

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,580
是因为那里看起来超像霍格沃茨的呢
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.
小说《哈利波特》中  主角们就读的学校

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,670
我就是在那里爱上了天文学
That's where I fell in love with astronomy,

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,180
我现在是任职于加州理工的天体物理学家
and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech,

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,200
所以也可以这么说...
so I guess you could say, uh,

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,700
拉杰是我名  星辰是我命
Raj is my name and stars are my game.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,820
我还有押韵命哦
And rhyming is also my game.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,420
可以算是"一杰两命"
So, uh, two games.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,530
好啦  我自己的事情说够了
Uh, anyway, that-that's enough about me.

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,910
我想听听关于你的一切
I want to hear everything about you.

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,960
我要去一趟厕所
I have to go to the bathroom.

29
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,350
我也会去厕所
I go to the bathroom, too.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,280
虽然有时候频繁到我都不好意思说了
Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,150
不过我给医生检查过了  一切正常
Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing.

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,450
也太顺利了吧
This is going great!

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,670
能帮我的印度茶续杯吗
Can I have a refill on my chai tea?

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,100
太好了
Yes...

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,290
感觉就十分有戏啊
I have a good feeling about this.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,960
早知道就买好套套了
I should have bought condoms.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,220
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十七集

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,650
您好  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,080
欢迎收看由谢尔顿·库珀出品的《有趣的旗帜》
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,830
在此对本集节目的延误出品致歉
My apologies that this episode is coming late.

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,530
上周我曾拍摄了"黑人历史月"纪念集
I did shoot one last week, in honor of Black History Month,

42
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,180
但后来受到我室友的提点
but I was informed by my roommate

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,940
我在节目中对乔治·华盛顿·卡弗的精湛描述
that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,160
乔治·华盛顿·卡弗  黑人  美国教育家  植物学家
农业化学家  对美国农业有巨大贡献

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,990
会有人觉得带有"严重种族歧视"
could be considered "wildly racist."

46
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,050
我的心一直与所有的
My heart goes out to the members

47
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,900
非裔美国人群体同在
of the African-American community,

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,190
我们都是受所谓"高层"压迫的苦命人
who, like me, have been kept down by The Man.

49
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,470
《有趣的旗帜》不只是给旗帜狂热爱好者看的
Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado;

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,890
也十分适合新晋旗帜迷
it's also for the flag novice,

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,360
因此请了位特别嘉宾
so, to help me with that,

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,760
大家欢迎我的朋友  邻居  旗帜界处女
please welcome my friend, neighbor, and flag virgin--

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,940
不是现实生活的处女
yeah, not a real virgin.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,790
她有过多次交媾经验了
She's had coitus many times.

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,950
有时就在本人听得见的范围里交媾呢
Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,330
有次还是在本人在看《超人特工队》的时候
Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles.

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,050
佩妮
Penny.

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,190
你好啊
Hello.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,760
佩妮  我知道
So, Penny, I understand

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,120
你对旗帜有相当浓厚的兴趣  对吗
you would like to learn more about flags.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,560
对啊  我有过太多次
Yeah, I can't tell you how many times

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,670
参加派对时  别人在大聊特聊旗帜
I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags

63
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,380
而我却完全插不上话的经验了
and I just couldn't join in. Yeah.

64
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,020
那你来这里就对啦
Well, you came to the right place.

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,240
抱歉  我们能暂停一下下嘛
Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,720
怎么了
What's wrong?

67
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,540
我只是觉得如果你对着我说话
I just think it might look more natural

68
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,680
会比你对着摄影机说话更自然
if you talked to me instead of the camera,

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,460
这样看起来更像在轻松聊天
you know, like, like a real conversation.

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,810
我们在表演课上有教过这个
It's something we work on in my acting class.

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,250
有意思
Interesting.

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,720
有些人在评语栏就有留言过
A few people in the comments section have said

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,020
说我的教学像机器人
that my delivery is robotic.

74
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,520
我一直以为是在称赞我
Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.

75
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,150
我们再试一遍吧  这一次
Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time,

76
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,250
也多注意一下你的肢体语言
you could work on your body language a bit.

77
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,060
当你这样弯腰驼背
You know, when you're all hunched like that,

78
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,400
会像是拒观众于千里之外
you're shutting the audience out,

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,740
如果你放松  肢体张开
but when you're relaxed and open,

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,550
会像是欢迎大家进入
you're inviting them in.

81
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,510
有道理
Right.

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,280
那我该用哪一种呢
And which one do I want?

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,020
欢迎大家那种啊
Let's try open.

84
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,740
我们的好友  旗帜  教过我的一件事就是
If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything,

85
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,000
向着风指引你的方向飘
it's to go where the wind takes you.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
不过要先确保自身良好地固定在旗杆上
As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole.

87
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,330
开始
And... action.

88
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,000
佩妮
So, Penny...

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,970
哪些对旗帜的疑问会让你夜不成寐呢
what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,210
我是内布拉斯加州人
Um, well, I'm from Nebraska.

91
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,650
不如你给我讲讲我们的州旗
So what can you tell me about the state flag?

92
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,450
天啊  佩妮
Gosh, Penny...

93
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,260
你今早早餐吃了啥啊
what'd you have for breakfast?

94
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,190
喝了一杯"超棒问题果汁"吗
A big glass of good question juice?

95
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,580
内布拉斯加州的州旗面就只是州徽
The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal

96
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,670
印在蓝底上
on a field of blue.

97
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,290
打开腿  欢迎大家进来
Spread your legs; invite them in.

98
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,400
相信我  绝对不对劲
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,010
拉杰碰到麻烦的时候  我都会有感应
I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,470
天啊  我们结婚前  你们俩是有多亲密啊
Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?

101
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,710
不要知道比较好
Don't look under that rock.

102
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,260
-拉杰  你没事吧  -你在家吗
- Raj, you okay? - You in there?

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,470
走开啦
Go away!

104
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,730
兄弟  开门嘛
Come on, buddy, open up.

105
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,330
我们都很担心你
We're worried about you.

106
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,380
就因为我没去上班
Oh, just because I stopped going to work

107
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,580
然后又不接电话  你们就觉得我出事了吗
and answering my phone you think something bad happened?

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,830
也可能是发生了好事啊
Maybe something good happened.

109
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,810
那有好事发生了吗
Did something good happen?

110
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,430
当然没有
Of course not!

111
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,540
好事从不发生在我身上
Nothing good ever happens!

112
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,740
怎么
What?

113
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,910
没事  就是感叹下
Nope, just-just... whoa.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,170
里面一股恶臭味
It smells pretty ripe in here.

115
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,580
光是用眼睛都可以感觉到
You kind feel it in your eyes.

116
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,220
拉杰  发生什么事了
Raj, what's going on?

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,490
我又被一个女人羞辱了
I was humiliated by yet another woman.

118
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,210
你没有杀死她  然后碎尸吧
You didn't kill her and chop her up--

119
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,910
屋里的味道不是尸臭  对吧
that's not what we're smelling, right?

120
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,770
不是
No.

121
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,580
我带她去喝咖啡
I took her for coffee,

122
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,620
结果她为了摆脱我
and she snuck out the bathroom window

123
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,930
从厕所的窗户溜走了
to get away from me.

124
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,810
可怜的小宝贝
Oh, you poor baby.

125
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,100
我去看了
I went and looked.

126
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,530
那个窗户又高又小
It was a high and tiny window.

127
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,340
她一定是想逃到了极点
She must have been very motivated.

128
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,730
我很遗憾  那太伤人了  但拜托
I'm sorry. That's awful, but come on.

129
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,660
你得放下这件事
you got to shake it off.

130
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,740
对啊  你不能窝在公寓里
Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment

131
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,270
就此度过余生吧
for the rest of your life.

132
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
为什么不能
Why not?

133
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,700
有网上购物和隔天送达
With online shopping and overnight delivery,

134
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,460
我要什么有什么
I can get anything I want.

135
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,370
瞧
Look,

136
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,560
我刚在亚马逊上订了一箱炖牛肉罐头
I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,980
和两只活龙虾
and two live lobsters on Amazon.

138
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,010
龙虾隔天就能送来
Lobsters overnight?

139
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,660
开什么玩笑  我看看
Oh, you're kidding. Let me see.

140
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,180
我也要
Well, I'll be.

141
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,520
还能再订个牛排
Look, you can throw in a couple steaks

142
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
配上一份海鲜牛排
and have a surf and turf.

143
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,650
海鲜牛排听起来不错
The surf and turf sounds good.

144
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,230
看看有没有玉米棒
See if they corn on the cob.

145
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,740
死阿宅们
Guys!

146
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,970
我们是来把他救出火坑
We're trying to get him out of here,

147
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,980
而不是把你俩推进去
not you in.

148
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,850
你们这是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

149
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,560
拜托  不要管我啦
Just please, leave me alone.

150
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,110
现在怎么办
Now what?

151
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,690
我不知道
I don't know.

152
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,290
我们可以去龙虾餐厅  边吃边谈啊
We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it.

153
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,030
谁不对龙虾有兴趣
We're all thinking it.

154
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,960
只不过我能礼貌地等他走了再谈
I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.

155
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,660
你好  谢尔顿
Hello, Sheldon.

156
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,890
你好
Hello.

157
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,900
"尼古丁成瘾"研究的
How's the final stage of

158
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,270
最后阶段进行得怎么样了
your nicotine addiction study going?

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,830
还行
Fine.

160
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,780
等下
Just hold on.

161
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,860
老娘在打电话呢
Mommy's on the phone!

162
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,990
抱歉
Sorry.

163
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,250
我们把猴子的香烟削减到一天一根
We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day,

164
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,210
所以现在局面有点紧张
so things are a little intense.

165
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,710
让我不禁怀念大麻上瘾的扁形虫
Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms.

166
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,620
那些小家伙乖多了
Those guys were mellow.

167
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,030
好消息
Good news.

168
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,150
最新一集《有趣的旗帜》已经放到网上了
Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.

169
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,090
好的  跟佩妮合作得怎么样
Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?

170
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,100
比我期望的好多了
Much better than I expected.

171
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,360
她甚至给我一些关于表演
She even gave me some helpful tips

172
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,700
和肢体语言的有用建议
about acting and body language.

173
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,020
看着
Watch.

174
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,190
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

175
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,850
我的世界不欢迎你
Not welcome to my world.

176
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,930
欢迎
Welcome.

177
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,460
不欢迎
Not welcome.

178
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,830
意义隐晦  但力道十足
Subtle, but powerful.

179
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,700
我知道
I know.

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,090
我还在学习如何控制力道
I'm still learning to control it.

181
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,380
那你有跟佩妮说她的建议很有用吗
Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?

182
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,380
我为什么要说
Why would I do that?

183
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,150
因为她是你的朋友  她帮了你大忙
Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job.

184
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,580
听到你这么说  她肯定会开心
I'm sure she'd like to hear it.

185
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,930
好吧
All right.

186
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,780
我不是说现在啊  喂
I didn't mean now. Hello?

187
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,530
是  是  你想要香烟
Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette.

188
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,810
我还想要个正常的男朋友呢
Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend.

189
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,520
自己忍着吧
Deal with it.

190
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,210
有事吗
Oh, hi. What's up?

191
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,190
需要我把门关上
You need me to shut the door

192
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,270
好让你像平时那样敲门吗
so you can do your knocking thing?

193
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,660
不用了
No.

194
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,790
-我还没开始  所以没关系  -那就好
- I didn't start yet; it's fine. - Okay.

195
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,420
那你找我干嘛
So, what do you need?

196
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,170
我在想
Well, I was thinking

197
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,810
你昨晚帮我的事
about you helping me out last night...

198
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,610
佩妮
Penny.

199
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,000
我是过来告诉你
And I just wanted to tell you...

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,510
佩妮
Penny.

201
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,070
关于"谁的表现很棒"
...that the answer to the question,

202
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,930
这个问题的答案  是你
"who did a great job?" is you.

203
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,740
佩妮
Penny.

204
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,100
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? -Yes.

205
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,180
你在镜头面前表现得很自然
You were very natural in front of the camera,

206
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,250
而且我觉得你建议非常有用
and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.

207
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,230
亲爱的  你让我今天真开心
Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.

208
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,260
任务完成
Okay.

209
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,680
我的表演课在周五晚上有场演出
Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night.

210
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,640
我可以把你和艾米放进宾客名单哦
I could put you and Amy on the guest list.

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
那听起来太无趣了
Oh, that sounds terrible.

212
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,770
我怎么可能想去啊
Why would I want to do that?

213
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,860
没错
That's right.

214
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,400
没有打火机  有烟也白搭
They're no good without the lighter.

215
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,740
你这表扬佩妮的建议可"真好"
Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.

216
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,950
为什么  怎么了
Why? What happened?

217
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,070
她想绑我们去
She tried to rope us into going

218
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,600
她的表演课  看个话剧
to her acting class to see a play.

219
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
别担心
Don't worry.

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,380
本人高瞻远瞩
Luckily, I had the good sense

221
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,440
早把这想法扼杀于摇篮之中了
to drown that kitten in the river.

222
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,220
谢尔顿  你太失礼了
Sheldon, that's very rude.

223
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,480
她为你的节目出了力
She helped you with your show.

224
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,160
你应该好好报答她
The right thing to do is reciprocate

225
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,760
去看她的话剧
by going to see her play.

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,420
规矩也太多了吧
Oh, so many crazy rules.

227
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,530
你扔过来的最好是巧克力糖
That better be Tootsie Rolls you're throwing at me!

228
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,790
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny.

229
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,110
佩妮
Penny.

230
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,040
感觉好多了
Oh yeah, much better.

231
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
干嘛
What?

232
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
艾米告诉我
Amy pointed out to me

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,700
你帮了我的忙
that since you did something nice for me,

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,730
所以我也应该礼尚往来
I'm obligated to do something nice for you.

235
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,510
所以
So...

236
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,060
好  我会去看你的傻帽话剧
yes, I'll go to your dopey play.

237
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,430
可我已经不想让你去了
Hey, I don't want you to go anymore.

238
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,430
为什么
Why not?

239
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,710
你如果愿意的话可以去
You should go 'cause you want to go,

240
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,050
但若是被强迫就算了
not because you have to.

241
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,040
老天爷啊  更多规矩  何时才能是尽头啊
Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop?

242
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,900
我能不能想去
Can I want to go

243
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,210
是因为我必须想去
because I have to want to go?

244
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,570
行  你想怎样就怎样
Okay. Do whatever you want.

245
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,220
不行  等等
Yeah, but now, wait.

246
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,600
我想怎样就怎样
Do whatever I want...

247
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,080
还是我必须想怎样就怎样
or whatever I have to want?

248
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,760
我的天  你来看话剧就是了
Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.

249
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,870
好吧
All right.

250
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,270
我不想去  不过这决定挺有道理的
I don't want to, but at least that makes sense.

251
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,610
我好几天没见过拉杰了
You know, I haven't seen Raj in several days.

252
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,940
他还是我们的小团体中的一员吗
Is he no longer a part of our social group?

253
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,380
如果不是的话  我们要开始面试替补人员吗
And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement?

254
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,290
或许这次我们该找个拉丁人
Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.

255
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,680
他决定再也不踏出自己的公寓了
He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.

256
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,070
真棒
Oh, brilliant.

257
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,140
我一直想这么做来着
I've been itching to pull that trigger.

258
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,930
他很伤心  因为总交不到女朋友
He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.

259
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,300
要不要我去给他点建议
Would it help if I gave him some pointers?

260
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,900
我逗你们玩呢
I'm just funnin' ya.

261
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,650
你好
Hi.

262
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,140
不知道你还记不记得我
I don't know if you remember me,

263
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,520
那天晚上我来参加过你的聚会来着
but I was here the other night at your party.

264
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,390
对  你和拉杰一起走的
Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.

265
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,090
是的
Uh, yeah.

266
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,700
就是你吗
You're the one?

267
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,330
我告诉你
Okay, let me tell you something.

268
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,010
你甩掉的那个人
That guy you blew off

269
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,640
是我最好的朋友
happens to be my best friend.

270
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,380
他被伤透了心
Okay? He was devastated.

271
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,640
对不起
Sorry.

272
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,270
你能把这个给他吗
Can you just give him this?

273
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,080
好
Okay.

274
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,010
但我得警告你
But I gotta warn you,

275
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,370
拉杰是个骄傲  情感激烈的人
Raj is a proud, passionate man.

276
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,790
如果你再撇下他偷跑掉
If you go running out on him again,

277
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,600
你离成为过去式
you're only gonna get, like,

278
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,220
就剩三到四次机会了
three or four more chances before you are history.

279
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,070
别这样嘛  她回来了
Come on, she came back.

280
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,190
这是好消息
This is good news.

281
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,490
你应该好好庆祝才对
You should celebrate.

282
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,770
我不想庆祝
I don't want to celebrate.

283
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,650
一点也不吗
Not even a little?

284
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,660
我们可以办个裤子派对啊
I mean... we could have a pants party.

285
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,380
快去找条穿上
Go put some on.

286
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,330
我要她的电话号码做什么
Why would I want her number?

287
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,180
我不想和这女人再有任何瓜葛
I don't want anything to do with this woman.

288
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,860
-拜托  拉杰  -你不明白
- Oh, come on, Raj... - No, you don't get it.

289
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,710
我再也不想和任何女人有瓜葛了
I want nothing to do with any woman.

290
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,000
我心已死
My heart is stone.

291
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,890
从现在起  我要当个和尚
From now on, I'm a monk.

292
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,250
我要拒绝尘世一切享受
I renounce all worldly pleasures.

293
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,760
除了龙虾
Except for lobster.

294
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,650
还有蒜蓉酱
And garlic butter.

295
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,500
我本来想告诉你这是她的损失
Boy, I want to tell you it's her loss,

296
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,380
但你还真是让我说不出口啊
but you are not making it easy.

297
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,790
你真是个好朋友  这么帮我  但...
You're-you're a good friend for trying to help, but...

298
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,800
我意已决
I've made my choice.

299
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,100
好吧
All right.

300
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,010
-那回头见  -回见
- Well, I'll see you around. - See you.

301
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,100
等等  把她的号码拿走
Oh, wait-- take her number.

302
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,680
别留下诱惑
I don't want the temptation.

303
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,220
好
Okay.

304
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,610
我必须坚强起来  坚持自己的奋斗目标
I must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose:

305
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,290
宇宙研究
the study of the universe.

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,740
好吧
All right.

307
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,710
谢谢你让我再也不想吃龙虾了
Thanks for ruining lobster for me.

308
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,970
等等
Wait!

309
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,440
把号码给我
Give me the number!

310
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,650
把号码给我
Give me the number!

311
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,490
把号码给我
Give me the number!

312
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,260
艾米  你的上瘾研究怎么样了
So, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?

313
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,300
很遗憾  我已经被项目团队踢出来了
Sadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.

314
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,540
为什么  出什么事了
Why? What happened?

315
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,580
典型的狗屁官僚主义
Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

316
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,950
你可以让动物对有害物质上瘾
You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance,

317
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,280
可以解剖它们的大脑
you can dissect their brains,

318
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,110
但你向它们扔它们自己的排泄物
but you throw their own feces back at them

319
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,860
就突然之间"不专业"了
and suddenly you're "unprofessional."

320
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,160
真是抱歉
I'm sorry...

321
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,520
我真多嘴...
...that I asked.

322
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,750
好啦  白痴话剧早看早完
All right, let's get this stupid play over with.

323
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,740
等等
Uh, hang on.

324
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,980
掏空你的口袋
Empty your pockets.

325
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,760
为什么
Why?

326
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,550
你知道原因
You know why.

327
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,090
任天堂游戏机
The Nintendo DS.

328
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,390
索尼游戏机
And the PSP.

329
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,520
还有一台呢
Now the Gameboy.

330
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,020
让不让人活了
Aw, for Pete's sake.

331
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,930
现在可以走了吗
Can we go now?

332
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,830
全部交出来了吗
Well, is that all of it?

333
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,920
放下就好
Just set it down.

334
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,050
告诉你  这可不是白痴话剧
Just so you know, this is not a stupid play.

335
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,790
《欲望号街车》是美国经典
A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.

336
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,760
原来是讲地面电车啊
It's about streetcars?

337
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,040
太好了  那这个也不要了
Oh, great. I won't need this.

338
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,940
等下
Just a sec.

339
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,130
谁会说"等下"啊
Oh, who says "just a sec"?

340
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,690
我恨我自己
I hate myself!

341
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,030
你好
Hello.

342
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,010
你好
Hi.

343
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,570
要进来吗
Uh, would you like to come in?

344
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,540
不用了  我马上就走
Oh, no, I can't stay.

345
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,030
我只是想说
I just wanted to say...

346
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,380
抱歉我从咖啡店逃走了
I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop.

347
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,720
那样做太不像话了
That wasn't cool.

348
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,060
所以
So, uh...

349
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,630
是的
Yeah.

350
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,730
等等
Wait.

352
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,490
至少能告诉我  哪里出错了吗
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

353
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,460
没事的  什么原因我都能接受
It's okay. I can take anything.

354
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,610
除非是说我做的事
Unless it's something I did,

355
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,620
说的话  或是我这人怎样
or said, or am.

356
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,390
这些原因会让我发火的
'Cause those are, like, my buttons.

357
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
不是这些原因
No, it's not any of that.

358
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
只是
It's just...

359
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,560
我在陌生人周围
I kind of have a hard time

360
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,780
会感觉非常不自在
around people I don't know.

361
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,030
真的吗
Really?

362
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,930
那你那晚
Then what were you doing

363
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,950
为什么会去漫画店
at the comic book store that night?

364
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
我在尝试强迫自己
I've been trying to force myself into situations

365
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,810
面对我不喜欢的环境
that I'm not comfortable with.

366
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,930
我在商店橱窗上看到宣传单
I saw the flyer in the store window,

367
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,060
我强迫自己去的
and I made myself go in.

368
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,970
我压根连个漫画粉都不是
I don't even like comic books.

369
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,270
我也不喜欢
Yeah, me neither.

370
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,380
那你为什么要去
Then what were you doing there?

371
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,160
我说谎了  我爱漫画书
I lied. I love them.

372
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,740
我这样说只是希望你愿意和我约会
I only said that so you'd go out with me.

373
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,770
你还是不要和我约会为妙
Oh, you don't want to do that.

374
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,600
我不能算是个正常人
I'm kind of broken.

375
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,750
太好了
That's great.

376
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,880
我也不正常
I'm broken, too.

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,830
你不是的
Oh, no, you're not.

378
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,890
我相当不正常
Oh, I totally am.

379
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,330
如果不是因为这瓶啤酒
If it wasn't for this beer,

380
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,880
我现在都没办法和你讲话
I couldn't even talk to you right now.

381
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,900
我完全就是一残疾货
I'm a wreck.

382
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,980
我有很多非常严重的毛病
There are many things seriously wrong with me.

383
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,880
而且不是指怪癖哦
And not quirks, either.

384
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,120
准确来说是可诊断的心理问题
Like... diagnosable psychological problems.

385
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,220
有可能是脑子坏了
Maybe brain damage.

386
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,960
我怎么知道你不是随便说说的
Well, how do I know you're not just saying that?

387
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,410
和我约会一次
Go out with me on one date,

388
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,630
我向你保证  你会看见满是毛病的我
and I promise you, you'll see.

389
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,090
好的
Okay.

390
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,850
发短信给我
Text me.

391
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,230
拜
Bye.

392
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,060
你不会后悔的
You won't regret it.

393
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,720
我是你这辈子所碰到  最悲催的男人
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.

394
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,510
就这样  孩子们
And that, boys and girls...

395
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,210
泡妞就是这样的
is how it's done.

396
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,560
你非常爱她  对吗
You love her very much, don't you?

397
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,710
是的
Yes.

398
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,720
我觉得你是个非常有奉献精神的人
I think you have a great capacity for devotion.

399
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,700
她去世后你会孤单对吗
You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you?

400
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,850
我明白这种感觉
I understand what that is.

401
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,800
孤单的感觉吗
To be lonely?

402
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,020
她很不错啊
She's pretty good, huh?

403
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,700
的确
She is.

404
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,560
什么时候才能演到有轨电车啊
But when do they get to the part about streetcars?

405
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,640
在我很小的时候
...when I was a very young girl.

406
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,750
我16岁时  发现了
When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery...

407
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,080
爱情
love.

408
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,300
一下子
All at once,

409
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,460
一切来得太突然了
and much, much too completely.

410
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,110
就好像你突然将明亮的灯光
It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light

411
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,660
照到总是一半处于黑暗中的东西一样
on something that had always been half a shadow.

412
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,290
于是我的生活发生了天翻地覆的变化
That's how it struck the world for me.

413
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,340
但我是不幸的
But I was unlucky.

414
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,610
被欺骗了
Deluded.

415
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,700
她的表演太精彩了
She's remarkable.

416
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,150
的确
She really is.

417
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,930
咱们的佩妮是大明星
Our Penny's a star.

418
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,360
她怎么能记住那么多台词
How can she remember all those lines,

419
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,000
但作为服务员  却不记得
but as a waitress, she can't remember

420
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,930
我的汉堡是不要加番茄的
"no tomato" on my hamburger?
