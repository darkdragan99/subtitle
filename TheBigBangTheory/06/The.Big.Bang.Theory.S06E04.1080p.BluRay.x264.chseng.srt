霍华德的太空舱
Howard's capsule should be reentering

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,350
马上就要到大气层了
the atmosphere any minute.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,660
他回来我挺开心的

我们会怀念你的好
We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,660
就像我们怀念早年的拨号路由器  录像带
The way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or...

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,110
以及莱纳德的健身房会员资格
or Leonard's gym membership.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,730
干嘛人家回来就踢他走
We're not kicking him out.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,810
我跟他也成了好哥们
Stuart and I have become good friends.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,740
一票赞成  一票反对
Okay, one vote for, one vote against.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,740
莱纳德你决定吧
Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,510
我对他留下没意见啊
I don't have a problem with stuart.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,070
他店里的东西还给我们打八折呢
Besides, he gives us a 20% discount at his comic book store.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,180
我的友谊没这么廉价
Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,060
我可以打七折

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,500
欢迎加入  好兄弟

宇宙的君王
Eloheinu melech ha-olam,

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,660
是您将面包带来人间
ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz.

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,570
唱的啥啊
What's that?

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,440
犹太人吃面包时的祷文
The Jewish prayer for eating bread!

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,310
犹太人没有从太空回归的祈祷文
We don't have one for falling out of space!

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,540
成功了
We did it!

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,220
我们安全着陆  活下来了
We're on the ground! We survived!

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,830
刚才只是开降落伞
That was just the parachute.

32
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,650
离着陆还有六英里呢

好的  谢谢
Oh, thanks.

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,910
那疯子在飞机上跟大家说
That nut job was telling everybody on the plane

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,460
他是宇航员

其他人呢
Where are the guys?

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,170
只有我来
Oh, it's just me.

53
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,120
我懂了

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,460
他们在家等着给我办惊喜派对
They're waiting back home with a big surprise party.

56
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,100
没有  我让他们明晚再见你

Gesundheit. You okay?

你回来了  我当然没事
I am now that you're back.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,340
走吧  咱们回家
Come on, let's go home

61
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,610
老娘要扒了你的裤子
so I can tear off those little pants.

62
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,430
好的  但提醒你件事
Great. Just keep in mind

63
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,140
宇航员的肌肉张力会减弱
astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space,

64
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,890
所以今晚的"重活"大多得靠你了
so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.

65
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,550
我好失望哦
You know, I am very disappointed

66
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,010
今晚不能给霍华德
that I won't be able to celebrate

67
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,950
庆祝他的成就
Howard's accomplishment tonight.

68
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,570
我也是  但明天就能见他啦
Me, too. But we'll see him tomorrow.

69
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,650
只是这是我认识他的这些年来
Yes, it's just that in all the years I've known him,

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,730
他从未有过机会得到我的赞赏
he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration.

71
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,610
本来还期待看他得到赞赏时
I was excited to see the look on his face

72
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,610
脸上那表情呢
when it finally happened.

73
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,930
你真是奇葩
You're unbelievable.

74
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,410
人中龙凤是谓奇葩
I know.

75
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,260
你画我猜
All right, Pictionary--

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,240
怎么分队
what are the teams?

77
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,710
男女分队如何
How about boys versus girls?

78
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,120
这会不会不太公平
Oh! That hardly seems fair.

79
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,440
我加入任何一队
But I guess any team that I'm not on

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,890
都是对其他队伍的不公平
has a decided disadvantage.

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,630
再次觉得你奇葩
Once again, unbelievable.

82
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,320
再次回你  鹤立鸡群是谓奇葩
Yeah, once again, I know.

83
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,940
来吧  第一回合
All right, round one.

84
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,110
这是题目
Here.

85
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,420
-好的  -来吧
- Got it. - Okay.

86
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,890
准备  开始
Ready, set, go.

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,470

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,420
礼物  没错
Present! Yeah!

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,090
莱纳德
Oh... Leonard.

96
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,870
这么明显了你还猜不出啊
Now, how can you not get that?

97
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,380
你画的是哪门子的礼物啊
In what universe is that a present?

98
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,130
不是礼物
It's not a present,

99
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,510
是现在[一字多义]
it's the present. Look.

100
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,070
你看  这是你我

我们正在玩"你画我猜"
We're playing Pictionary.

103
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,880
就是"现在"
In the present.

104
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,860
天啊  我们会虐死他们
Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.

105
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,700
是夸克胶子等离子体
It's a quark-gluon plasma.

106

和夸克无关
Nothing with quarks.

110

-是巧克力豆饼干  -正确
- It's a chocolate chip cookie! - Yes!

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,010
你怎么可能猜不到这个
How could you miss that?

115
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,950
你要人猜出"巧克力豆饼干"
Hey, if you want someone to guess "chocolate chip cookie,"

116
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,670
就得在旁边画上一杯牛奶啊

Uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don't...

129

Now?

130
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,340
再等会
Soon.

131
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,440
拜托  莱纳德
Come on, Leonard,

132
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,580
我答案都递到你嘴边了啊
I am spoon-feeding this to you.

133
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,120

-指甲...指甲油  -答对了
- Uh, nail... polish? - Yep!

138
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,480
不对  等一下
Wait, no, no!

139
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,810
那个词是"波兰的"
The word is "Polish."
"波兰的"与"指甲油"只有大小写之分

140
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,790
看  波兰的大香肠

by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer.

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,130
最后
And then, finally,

144
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,700
如果还不够充分  虽然那是不可能的
if that wasn't enough-- which it should've been--

145
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,870
这是被她所发现的镭的辐射
This is Madame Curie killing herself

146
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,060
害死的居里夫人
by discovering Radium, who,

147
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,220
尽管她后来加入了法国籍
although she was a naturalized French citizen,

148
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,750
可她出生时是波兰的人
was Polish by birth!

149
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,270
不好意思  那个词明明是指甲油
Excuse me, the word is "polish."

150
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,670
看到没  是小写的p
See? Small "p."

151
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,940
还真的是小写
So it is.

152
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,830
这道题我俩各打五十大板吧
I guess we both share blame on this one.

153
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,640
妮妮   你还好吧
Bernie, you okay?

154
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,020
我马上就出来
Yeah, I'll be right there.

155
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,160
我不在的时候  你新养了一头海狮吗
Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?

156
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,090
我有点过敏而已
It's just allergies.

157
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,590
那就好
Okay.

158
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,670
吃点抗过敏药  就没事了
Took some benadryl. I'll be fine.

159
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,830
好了
So...

160
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,730
你想我吗
Did you miss me?

161
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,560
你觉得呢   每一分钟我都
Are you kidding? Every minute of every...

162
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,640
抱歉哦
Excuse me.

163
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,790
亲爱的  我们不用急着干这事
Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.

164
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,870
当然要啦
Yes, we do.

165
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,990
我们刚结婚你就出发了
You left right after we got married.

166
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,580
这算是我俩的蜜月呢
This is like our honeymoon.

167
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,330
现在
Now,

168
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,120
你给我坐稳了
hold on to your hat.

169
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,780
你没事吧
You okay?

170
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,310
有点头晕
A little dizzy.

171
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,330
一定是过敏药的关系
Must be the benadryl.

172
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,470
咱们换个体位吧
Switch places with me.

173
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,930
好的
Okay.

174
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,350
现在
Now...

175
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,780
快亲我
...Kiss me!

176
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,010
伯纳黛特
Bernadette?

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,560
妮妮  妮妮
Bernie? Bernie?

178
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,500
刚才真是爽爆了
That was amazing.

179
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,020
你让我高潮迭...
You made me feel things I never...

180
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,880
又快完事又有点小恶心啊
Well, that was quick and a little gross.

181
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,450
现在我了解她过去的感受了
Now, I know how she feels.

182
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,210
谢尔顿  你不是知道
Hey, Sheldon, you're always

183
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,050
很多小趣闻吗
full of fun little facts.

184
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,170
"虐得你屁滚尿流"这句话
Where did the expression

185
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,040
语源是从哪来的啊
"got your ass handed to you" come from?

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,800
我不知道
Don't know.

187
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,810
我猜这一定是古罗马的谚语
I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome

188
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,970
他们会把输家的屁股切下来
where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off

189
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,190
让输家看着屁股在地上滚
and then go, "here."

190
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,450
你懂得  也算是给"失败者之神"的献礼
You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.

191
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,440
我不是失败者
I am not a loser.

192
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,680
"你画我猜"根本就比不出人的智商和能力
Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.

193
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,220
公平地说
Mmm, in all fairness,

194
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,890
"你画我猜"包含了词汇量和绘图能力
Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills.

195
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,620
算是很全面的游戏了
It's a pretty well-rounded game.

196
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,700
巧克力豆饼干都画不好的人
Lot of big talk from a man

197
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,100
还敢在此大放厥词
who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.

198
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,360
算了  你再选一个游戏吧
All right, fine, pick another game.

199
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,910
艾米和我照样虐得你一败涂地
Amy and I will beat you at anything.

200
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,510
好啊
All right.

201
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,350
那我们玩
Let's play...

202
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,490
"西班牙物理嘉年华"
Physics Fiesta.

203
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,540
拜托  那是什么
Oh, come on, what is that?

204
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,450
我刚发明的游戏
It's a game that I just invented,

205
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,410
玩家得用西班牙语回答物理问题
in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish.

206
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,870
希格斯玻色子在哪里[西语]
Donde esta el boson de higgs?

207
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,060
在粒子加速器里[西语]
En el acelerador de particulares.

208
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,520
干得好  我的朋友[西语]
Bueno, mi amigo.

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,830
不  我们才不玩现编出来的蠢游戏
No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.

210
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,730
哪个游戏不是编出来的
All games are made up.

211
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,490
那又不是大自然的产物
They're not found in nature.

212
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,660
当年又不是在地上挖洞时  碰巧找到的
You don't just dig in the ground, come across

213
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,450
拳击机械人大战系列玩具
a rich vein of rock'em sock'em robots.

214
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,740
换个游戏吧
Just pick another game.

215
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,240
我们可以玩点体育类游戏
Why don't we do something athletic

216
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,220
比如去大学的泳池玩水球
like go over to the university pool and play water polo?

217
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,700
不行  谢尔顿下水就沉
No good-- Sheldon doesn't float.

218
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,490
确实如此
That is true.

219
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,750
我的体密度比平常人高
I have a higher than normal body density.

220
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,580
泡澡的水放太多  我都可能会淹死
If I run too deep a bath, I drown.

221
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,890
那就玩点简单的吧
All right, let's keep it simple.

222
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,750
飞镖怎么样
How about darts?

223
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,290
不行  这个也不公平
Oh, that's not fair either.

224
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:41,960
怎么不行
Why not?

225
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,790
飞镖是酒吧里的游戏
Darts is a bar game.

226
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,040
你一到法律年龄就天天在那儿混了
You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.

227
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,270
是啊  她到那年纪"才开始"
Yeah, that's when it started.

228
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,900
总之  对于一切酒吧游戏
Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage

229
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,550
她都有很大优势
in all tavern- based competitions.

230
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,860
台球  啤酒乒乓  湿衣比赛
Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests--
湿衣比赛: 女士不穿内衣只穿T恤往身上倒水
由男士来评判哪位身材最佳

231
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,010
这些都不行
they're all out.

232
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,600
好吧
Okay.

233
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,930
不过我得声明一下
Just for the record,

234
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,260
我从来没参加过湿衣比赛
I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest.

235
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,810
我赢过  但是因为我醉时喝酒洒了一身
I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk,

236
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,420
所以
So...

237
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,480
我们可以去加州大学的尸体实验室
We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA

238
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
玩真人版手术游戏
and play real-life operation.

239
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,900
-不  -不要
- No. - I don't think so.

240
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,020
确定吗  虽然鼻子不会发亮
Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn't light up,

241
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,000
手术游戏:  对玩具人偶做手术
犯错时病人鼻子会发红光  并全身震动

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,120
但如果尸体足够新鲜
but if the corpse is fresh enough,

243
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,810
偶尔还是能让他腿抽抽呢
sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.

244
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,120
妈  小星星亮晶晶
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle,

245
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,650
你的小星儿回家啦
your little star is home!

246
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,970
妈  解一下门链子
Ma, the chain's on the door!

247
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,000
霍华德
Howard?

248
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,800
我还以为要明天才能见到你呢
I thought I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow!

249
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,050
小妮妮身体不太舒服
Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well,

250
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,860
所以我就来看看你嘛
so I thought I'd stop by,

251
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,660
给你讲讲我人生中最棒的历险故事
tell you about the greatest adventure of my life,

252
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,880
听听你会怎么打击我
see if you can make me feel bad about it.

253
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,640
好的  稍等  我有点衣冠不整
Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I'm not decent!

254
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,420
好的
All right.

255
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,630
20年来都没解开过睡衣
Woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years.

256
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,670
我一不在她就衣冠不整啦
Suddenly she's not decent?

257
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,590
你想我躲在衣柜还是从后门开溜
You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?!

258
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,690
嘘  你得小点声
Shh, you need to whisper.

259
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,300
妈  谁在里面呢
Ma, who is in there?

260
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,360
没人  是电视的声音
Uh, nobody! The TV is on!

261
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,130
我只找到一只袜子
I only got one sock.

262
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,520
另一只跑哪去了
Where's my other sock?

263
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,660
那是谁啊
Who is that?

264
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,290
说了是电视里的对话
I told you, it's the TV.

265
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,810
杰·雷诺[主持人]丢了一只袜子  太逗了
Jay Leno lost a sock; it's hilarious.

266
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,570
你要是忙的话  我可以回头再来
If you're busy, I can come back.

267
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,100
稍微等我一下
Just give me a second!

268
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,070
快走快走
Go, go, go, go.

269
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,230
施耐德医生
Dr. Schneider?

270
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,110
你好  霍华德
Oh, hello, Howard.

271
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,920
你在这儿做什么呢
What are you doing here?

272
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,820
上门看病来了
Um, house call.

273
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,750
可你是个牙医啊
You're a dentist.

274
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,200
没错  我是牙医
Yes, yes, I am.

275
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,040
他好像发现我们有猫腻了
I think he's on to us!

276
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,830
好了  摘下眼镜
Okay, glasses off.

277
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,720
找到沃尔多
Find Waldo.
《寻找沃尔多》  在书中密密麻麻的人群中
找出主角沃尔多

278
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,920
快点  找到他  找到他
Hurry up, find him, find him.

279
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,540
我在看呢  别对我大吼大叫的
I'm trying! Don't yell at me!

280
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,710
我的老天  他戴了帽子  眼镜
For goodness' sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses,

281
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,870
穿着红条上衣
and a red striped shirt.

282
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,040
我知道他长什么样
I know what he looks like.

283
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,100
在这儿呢  我找着他了
Oh, there he is, I got him.

284
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,910
真棒  我们又赢了
Yes, we win again!

285
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,830
你怎么会找不到他
How could you not find him?

286
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,490
因为他不好找
Because he's hard to find.

287
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,480
如果好找的话
If he was easy to find,

288
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,160
这游戏就该改名《沃尔多在这里》了
The books would be called There's Waldo.

289
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,720
57  58  59
57, 58, 59,

290
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,470
一分钟到了
that's one minute.

291
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,060
长除法  长除法
Long division, long division.

292
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,670
快去快去
Go, go, go.

293
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,710
得写出计算过程哦
Remember, show your work.

294
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,970
我没事
I'm okay.

295
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,560
我没事
I'm okay.

296
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,840
一点也不好
I'm not okay.

297
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,660
快起来  总不能连数学都输吧
Get up, we can't lose in math.

298
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,950
-37  -干得好
- 37! - Yes!

299
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,890
各就各位  预备  摔跤
Ready, set, wrestle.

300
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,490
1  2  3  倒下
One, two, three, pin.

301
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,440
别这样
Stop that.

302
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,190
艾米  帮个忙啊
Amy, do something.

303
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,530
艾米  救命
Amy, help.

304
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,250
艾米  别这样
Amy, stop that.

305
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,040
艾米  佩妮  你们两个快停下
Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.

306
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,300
传送一人上舰[星际迷航]
One to beam aboard?

307
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,210
我的天  你回来了
Oh, my God, you're back.

308
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,540
瞧你
Oh, look at you.

309
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,510
你看起来好像长高了
You, you look like you grew.

310
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,030
是啊
Yeah.

311
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,640
失重状态拉松了我的脊柱
The lack of gravity did decompress my spine,

312
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,930
所以我高了3.8厘米
so I'm like an inch and a half taller.

313
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,640
趁我没缩水前  我明天就去车管局
I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed

314
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,400
改驾照资料
before I shrink back.

315
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,370
请进  请进
Oh, uh, come in, come in.

316
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,180
我原以为要等到明天
Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get

317
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,710
才能见到你
to see you until tomorrow.

318
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,970
天气转凉  伯纳黛特身体不适
Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather

319
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,360
我妈则被我的牙医压在了身下
and my mom's kind of under my dentist.

320
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,370
你妈和你的牙医上床吗
Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?

321
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,300
前牙医
Former dentist.

322
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,260
我要换一个  我知道他的手摸过"什么"了
I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.

323
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,710
所以你是在一个人到处晃悠吗
So you're wandering all around by yourself?

324
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,170
从太空凯旋而归的英雄
That's not the kind of hero's welcome

325
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,650
可不应该受到这种待遇啊
an astronaut should come home to.

326
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,580
没事的  咱们太空牛仔
It's okay, you know, we space cowboys

327
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,340
舍身为科学图的不是名与利
don't do what we do for glory and fame.

328
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,260
这些甜头就留给摇滚明星  运动明星
We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes

329
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,430
和霍伊·曼德尔好了
and your Howie Mandels.

330
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,800
哥们儿  欢迎回来
Oh, hey, man, welcome back.

331
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,910
斯图尔特  多谢了
Oh, Stuart, thanks.

332
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,900
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

333
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,780
我现在算是住在这里了
I, I kind of live here now.

334
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,690
字面意  在他的脚上
直到他的生活回归正轨
Just until he gets back on his feet,

335
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,860
看起来非常帅气哦
which are looking pretty good

336
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,770
这双靴子是我送给他的生日礼物
in the boots I bought him for his birthday.

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,680
他好宠我  我爱死了
Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.

338
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,220
你们现在是好兄弟了吗
Wow, so you guys are like buds now?

339
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,230
是啊  我们总是玩在一起
Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.

340
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,760
而且  他没有女朋友
Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend,

341
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,700
我也没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

342
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,710
就好像我和他的生活都有空洞之处
It's like we both had these holes in our lives,

343
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,070
而现在我们彼此填补了这个"空洞"
but now we fill each other's holes.

344
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,550
这话咱们老美听起来会觉得怪怪的
That sounds a little funny to an American ear.

345
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,550
-哪部分  -从头到尾
- Which part? - Just all of it.

346
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,480
好啦  你们今晚有什么安排
Okay, so w-what do you guys got going on tonight?

347

Raj is taking me to the sound of music sing-along.

348
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,760
"音乐之声二人唱"
Sound of music sing-along?

349
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,800
以前是咱俩的活动  不过没关系
That used to be our thing, but that's cool.

350
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,630
霍华德  这依然是我们的活动
Oh, Howard, it's still our thing.

Come with us, we'll, we'll get you a scalped ticket.

352
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,730
去了然后一个人坐旁边吗
So I'd be sitting by myself?

353
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,600
我们可以换着坐
We'll switch.

354
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
中场休息后你可以和我一起坐
You'll come sit with me after intermission.

355
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,060
那唱《雪绒花》时我岂不是孤零零的一个人
So I-I-I'd be sitting by myself during "Edelweiss"?

356
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,280
不  你们去吧  玩得开心点
No, no, you guys go. Have fun.

357
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,120
好吧  我们明天见吗
Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?

358
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,850
当然了  回见了  斯图尔特
Absolutely. See you, Stuart.

359
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,500
回见
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,740
他是不是长高了
Is he taller?

361
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,810
至少我妈还让她男朋友逃窗走
At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.

362
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,070
好了  标准集市吃馅饼大赛的规则是
All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are:

363
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,580
不许用手  最先吃完的人获胜
No hands, first one to clean the pan wins.

364
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,000
数到三就开始
On the count of three.

365
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,670
-一  二  -等等
- One, two... - Wait.

366
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,930
我有点担心
I'm a little concerned.

367
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,310
蓝莓富含抗氧化物
Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.

368
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,290
怎样
So?

369
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,230
吃了这么多抗氧化物
So, with all those antioxidants,

370
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,560
那我的氧化物没了怎么办
what if I run out of oxidants?

371
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,910
谢尔顿  咱俩一整晚输得一塌糊涂
Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night.

372
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,020
所以要么你把脸埋在馅饼里
Now, you either stick your face in that pie

373
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,530
要么我把那馅饼往你脸上埋
or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.

374
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,540
太粗鲁了
That's rude.

375
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,490
一  二  三  开吃
One, two, three, eat.

376
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,230
伙计们  猜猜谁从太空回来了
Hey, guys, guess who's back from space.

377
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,420

378
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,430
蓝莓卡鼻孔了

蓝莓卡鼻孔了
blueberry in my nose!

380
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,040
吸进去继续吃
Snort it down and keep eating!

381
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,550
你看起来有点面熟
You look familiar.

382
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,430
不太可能
I don't think so.

383
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,960
没错  我刚在新闻上看到你了
Yeah, I just saw you on the news.

384
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,600
你是个宇航员
You're an astronaut.

385
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,810
是的
Yes.

386
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,230
我是
Yes, I am.

387
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,030
好样儿的
Good for you.

388
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,410
来块免费芝士蛋糕怎么样
How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?

389
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,340
太谢谢你了
Oh, thank you so much.

390
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,800
我今天晚上倒霉到家了
I've been having the worst night.

391
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,220
我刚回来  我朋友们不在乎
I just got back, and my friends don't care,

392
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,150
我老婆病了  我去我妈家
my wife's sick, I went to my mom...

393
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,500
再废话看你吃不吃得着
You want the cheesecake or not?

394
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,880
来吧  多谢了
Yes, please.

395
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,680
