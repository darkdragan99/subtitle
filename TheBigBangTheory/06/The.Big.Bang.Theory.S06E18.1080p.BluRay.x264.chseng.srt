1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,090
我知道你们不想弄这事
Look, I know you guys don't want to do this,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,230
但我们没得选好吗
but we have no choice.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,600
你们大可以唧唧歪歪  浪费时间
So, you can either bitch and whine

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
也可以通力合作  早点搞定
or we can just get it over with.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,000
我负责唧唧
I got "whine."

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,690
我负责歪歪
I got the "b word."

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,570
我们与学校的合约中
Yeah, well, it's in our contract

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,110
注明了得为大学委员会服务
to serve on a university committee.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,680
老实说  我也认同这件事
And frankly, this is one I believe in.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,690
主题就是
Okay, here we go.

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,790
鼓励更多女性加入科学领域
Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.

12
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,020
拜托  我要有本事说服女人
Come on, if I was any good

13
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,400
去做我想她们做的事
at convincing women to do stuff,

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,430
那我20多岁时  就不用常自己在浴室"自乐"了
I wouldn't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower.

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,110
要我说的话
If you ask me,

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,260
搞这事根本只是浪费时间
this whole thing is a waste of our time.

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,390
帮助女性浪费时间吗
Helping women?

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,400
帮人就是浪费时间
Yeah, helping anyone.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,490
人们应该自己照顾自己
People should take care of themselves.

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,980
比如像昨天
Oh, like yesterday,

21
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,270
你叫我载你去干洗店
when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners,

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,180
药店跟邮局那样吗
the pharmacy and the post office?

23
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,560
我又没说人们不能使用工具
I'm not saying people can't use tools.

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,090
连水獭想吃蛤蜊时都知道用石头敲开了
Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,960
你觉得花时间
You don't think it's worthwhile

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,380
让更多女性加入科学行业不好吗
to try to get more women working in science.

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,750
我觉得你太有性别歧视了
I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

28
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,130
我相信在性别平等的社会
I believe in a gender-blind society

29
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,630
比如《星际迷航》中  各个种族
like in Star Trek, where women and men

30
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,560
信仰各异的男女都平等地一起共事
of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,830
你是说那个先进到能发明出
You mean where they were advanced enough

32
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,830
能进行恒星际旅行的曲速引擎
to invent an interstellar warp drive,

33
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,660
却还是让一个黑人女性接太空电话的世界吗
but a black lady still answered the space phone?

34
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,680
我的浴室"自乐"时间有不少是跟
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,760
乌乎拉通讯官度过的
with Lieutenant Uhura.

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,060
先不管霍华德的下流回忆
Howard's disturbing recollections aside,

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,880
我不喜欢被逼去做这些
I don't appreciate being forced to do

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,340
平庸的委员会工作
banal committee work.

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,960
是是是  太大材小用了
Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
没错
Exactly.

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,550
就跟叫霹雳火
It's like asking the Human Torch
霹雳火是《神奇四侠》里的人物  能让全身变成火焰

42
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,550
来热你的冷冻玉米煎饼一样
to heat up your frozen burrito.

43
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,360
明白
Got it.

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,470
我想到了一个
All right, I'm thinking one way

45
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,880
避免在同行评审阶段遭受歧视的方法
to counter bias in the peer-review process,

46
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,690
就是报告都用中性名字递交
is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names.

47
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,130
比如S·史密斯
Like S. Smith

48
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,360
而不是沙曼莎·史密斯
instead of Samantha Smith.

49
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,130
专业领域的某些女性使用缩写名
I suppose there is a history of professional women

50
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,800
来避免先入为主的批判  的确行之有年了
using their initials, so as not to be pre-judged.

51
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,250
《哈利波特》作者  J.K.罗琳
Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,

52
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,200
《星际迷航》编剧  D.C.丰塔纳
uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,970
范奈斯市的钢管舞女  DD杯·麦伦[巨乳]
Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons.

54
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,940
好啦  我们今天有帮到女性了
All right, I think we've really helped women today.

55
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,400
来打电动吧
Let's fire up the old Xbox.

56
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,970
你们俩  拜托别让历史重演
Guys, please don't make this a school project

57
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,450
小时候做报告  聪明孩子做全部
where I'm the smart kid doing all the work

58
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,190
其他懒鬼就在旁边看着
while the slackers sit back and watch.

59
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,020
我们才不是呢
No, we're not.

60
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,070
这次是聪明孩子负责做全部工作
This time you're the smart kid doing all the work

61
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,930
而更聪明的孩子在旁边看着
while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.

62
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,900
你觉得我也是更聪明的孩子吗
So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,720
不是  你只是我用来证明论点的工具
No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.

64
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,160
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十八集

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,850
我们的主题是"鼓励女性加入科学领域"
Guys, our topic is "Encouraging Women in Science."

66
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,870
你们俩不能玩少点性别歧视的游戏吗
Can you at least play a less sexist game?

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,260
这哪有歧视女性
How is it sexist?

68
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,400
我的角色能像男人一样把大战锤挥起来
My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.

69
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,630
更别说她有着超发达的乳腺
Not to mention she has mammary glands

70
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,770
足够喂养一家三十口
that could nurse a family of 30.

71
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,620
而且剩下来的量
And have enough milk left over

72
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,850
都够开冰激凌店用了
to open a Baskin Robbins.

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,670
母亲  战士公主  冰激凌加盟店老板
Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner--

74
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,750
女性职场障碍全被打爆啊
I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.

75
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,650
谢尔顿  你老说
Sheldon, you're always saying

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,310
你比我聪明无数倍
how much smarter you are than me.

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,570
那你能用五秒钟想出一个
Spend five seconds and come up with one idea

78
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,590
能让更多女性加入科学领域的方法吗
on how to get more women into science.

79
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,810
你的所有点子都仅限于学术界阶段的问题
All your ideas address the issue at a university level.

80
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,870
但那阶段已经太晚了
By then it's too late.

81
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,690
你应该设计一个扩展研究
You need to design an outreach program

82
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,610
把目标延伸到中学阶段的少女们
that targets girls at the middle school level

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,480
把她们导向追求学术
and sets them on an academic track

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,950
迈向硬科学的道路之上
towards the hard sciences.

85
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,790
还真是个好点子
That's actually good.

86
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,470
我怎么就没想到呢
Why didn't I think of that?

87
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,790
有些人是水獭  而有些人就只是石头
Some people are otters, some people are rocks.

88
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,610
有没有什么方法
I wonder if there's a way

89
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,200
可以先试验一下这点子呢
we could give the idea a trial run.

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,740
我可以试试打电话给我以前的中学
Maybe I could call my old middle school,

91
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,290
看我们能不能跟一些女学生聊聊
see if we can talk to some of the female students.

92
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,750
这不错啊  安排一下
That's great-- try to set up something

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,180
让我们三个去那里试试
for the three of us to go over there.

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,330
先等等吧
Oh, hold on.

95
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,120
虽然我对谈科学没有任何问题
While I'm comfortable speaking about science,

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,180
但我不确定能否勾起中学女孩的兴趣
I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren.

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,930
我先上网搜搜吧
Better Google it.

98
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,020
你打算搜什么关键句
What exactly are you looking up?

99
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,090
"如何让12岁少女兴[性]奋"
"How do I get 12-year-old girls excited."

100
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,650
不要  快住手
No! No!

101
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,400
再次感谢你们让我参一脚"闺蜜之夜"
Thanks again for letting me crash "girls' night."

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,250
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

103
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,380
你带来上好的红酒  还给我们做芝士火锅
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

104
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,900
比这小的好处我都"睡"过了
I've slept with guys for less.

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,460
开玩笑啦
It's a joke.

106
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,970
基于真实故事的玩笑
Based on real events.

107
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,980
总之  我希望可以
Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh,

108
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,100
向你们请教一下
pick your brains a little.

109
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,010
我周五要跟露西约会
I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday

110
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,360
我需要一个超棒的初次约会
and I need a killer first date.

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,220
进化生物学说  女人容易被
Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted

112
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,340
临危不乱的男人所吸引
to a man who is steady in the face of danger,

113
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,630
所以我建议去危险的地方
so I recommend an unsafe environment.

114
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,950
去贫民区破旧的酒吧
Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks...

115
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,770
去疯人院附近野餐
picnic near a lunatic asylum...

116
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,280
去贫民窟品酒
a wine tasting on Skid Row.

117
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,050
露西有社交焦虑症
Eh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues.

118
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,490
或许我们可以从简单点的地方着手
Maybe we could start with something simpler.

119
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,310
你何不带她去迪士尼乐园
Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

120
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,660
你们可以玩室内过山车
You go on Space Mountain,

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,700
两人处于黑暗中  她紧紧抓住你
you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

122
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,840
但千万要记住
Yeah, but you just have to remember,

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,150
那比你想象中还快结束
that ride is shorter than you think

124
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,460
终点前还会给你俩拍照
and they take a picture of you at the end,

125
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,920
所以记得在那之前就穿回衣服
so make sure you got your clothes back on.

126
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,630
开玩笑啦
It's a joke.

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,510
基于真实故事的玩笑
Based on real events.

128
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
迪士尼乐园  我不知道该不该去
Mm, Disneyland? I don't know.

129
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,150
人挤人  还有奇怪的角色玩偶人四处游走
With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around,

130
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,830
会让我有一种在印度的错觉
just reminds me too much of India.

131
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,680
我从来没去过迪士尼
I haven't been to Disneyland since I was a kid.

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,300
真应该找个周末去玩玩
We should definitely go one weekend.

133
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,760
周末人太多了
Weekends are too crowded.

134
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,520
那就不去上班  工作日时去
So, blow off work, go on a weekday.

135
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,810
翘班吗
Hooky?

136
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,990
我这辈子连课都没翘过
I've never played hooky in my life.

137
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,280
我妈说翘课的女生最后都会
My mom said that's how girls end up

138
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,030
沉迷于大麻和爵士乐
addicted to reefer and jazz music.

139
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,690
其实翘课的女生更有可能在酒店
It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel

140
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,220
跟一个34岁的老头开房
with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

141
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,590
也是玩笑吗
Joke?

142
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,960
我现在对此能一笑置之了
I can laugh about it now.

143
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,060
你们觉得怎么样
So, what do you say?

144
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,210
周五我们放下工作去迪士尼  好吗
This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

145
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,390
我赞成
I'm in.

146
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,680
我也赞成
Me, too.

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,050
打断一下
Excuse me,

148
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,980
你们不是要帮忙解决我的问题吗
I thought we were trying to solve my problem?

149
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,650
对哦  没错
Oh, yeah, right.

150
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,380
等下  你的问题是什么来着
Wait, what was your problem again?

151
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,440
我是一个无法跟女性正常交流的男人
I am a man who can't talk to women,

152
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,320
试图想出
trying to figure out

153
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,310
如何跟一个患有严重社交焦虑症
how to go on a romantic date with a girl

154
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,080
而无法跟人共处的女孩
who suffers from such crippling social anxiety

155
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,060
进行一次浪漫约会
she can't be around other people.

156
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,850
对哦  这还真有难度
Yeah, that's a toughie.

157
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,550
我们好好想想
Let's think.

158
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,690
我们是光去迪士尼  还是也去加州冒险乐园呢
We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?

159
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,610
真是太好了  你的母校肯让我们
It's nice of your old school to let us try out

160
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,750
试验在一群女学生面前宣讲科学
our science talk on some female students.

161
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,150
他们其实挺开心的
Well, they're actually pretty excited.

162
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,350
我是他们最出名的毕业生
I'm their most famous alum.

163
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,690
如果不算那个奸杀妓女
If you don't count the serial killer

164
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,390
还吃掉她们的连环杀手的话
who ate all those prostitutes.

165
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,960
你的感觉一定很好吧
This must feel pretty good for you,

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,330
以宇航员的身份荣归母校
coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.

167
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,090
那是  我上一次在这里时
Yeah, last time I was here,

168
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,250
我只是个骨瘦如柴的小阿宅
I was just a scrawny little nerd.

169
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,160
现在还是  不过是多了宇航员的身份
And now you're also an astronaut.

170
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,400
这里有我很多回忆
So many memories.

171
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,520
我经常在这些走廊里
I mean, how many times in these hallways

172
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,570
被人绊倒  被人打  还被吐口水
was I tripped, punched and spit on?

173
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,750
瞧  这是我以前的储物柜
Oh, look, here's my old locker.

174
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,420
虽然我是工程学的硕士
I have a masters in engineering

175
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,060
但我还是想不明白斯科特·坎宾斯基
and I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski

176
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,400
是怎么把我和我的公文包一起塞进里面的
got me and my briefcase to fit in there.

177
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,820
干嘛
What?

178
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,640
没事
Nothing.

179
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,580
明智  我们可不想惹麻烦
Smart. We don't want any problems.

180
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,390
真不敢相信  我居然翘班去迪士尼
I can't believe I ditched work for Disneyland.

181
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,930
你怎么跟老板说的
What did you tell your boss?

182
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,390
我相当聪明  一步一步铺好哏
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.

183
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,540
昨晚7点
At 7:00 last night,

184
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,030
我打去跟他说实验室的问题
I called about a problem at the lab

185
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,100
然后不经意地提到我要出去吃海鲜
and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood.

186
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,750
9点半
At 9:30,

187
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,970
我打去告诉他  我其中一个扇贝吃起来怪怪的
I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird.

188
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,420
11点半  我打过去说
At 11:30, I called and said

189
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,840
我吐得天昏地暗
I was throwing up like a fire hose.

190
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,270
12点45分
At 12:45,

191
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,160
我打过去  什么也不说就一直干呕
I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds,

192
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,770
而现在我在去迪士尼的路上了
and now I'm going to Disneyland.

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,040
佩妮  你怎么说的
Penny, what did you say?

194
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,390
我在芝士蛋糕工厂上班
I work at the Cheesecake Factory,

195
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,170
说声再见就能甩头走人
I said "Bye."

196
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,100
我们先玩什么
So, what are we gonna do first?

197
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,950
我不知道你们俩想玩什么
I don't know about you guys,

198
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,430
但我要直奔一个地方
but I'm gonna make a beeline for the place

199
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,400
可以把你装扮成公主
that gives you a princess makeover.

200
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,900
听起来很好玩
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

201
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,860
你说笑呢  对吧
You're kidding, right?

202
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,540
我们不是要喝个大醉  然后去坐游乐设施吗
We're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?

203
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,480
别这样  和我们一起玩嘛
Come on, do it with us.

204
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,280
好吧  随便吧
All right, whatever.

205
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,360
要怎么玩
How does it work?

206
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,900
你先选个公主
Okay, so, you pick your princess--

207
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,140
睡美人  白雪公主  灰姑娘
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella--

208
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,750
他们会帮你弄头发  化妆  弄全套
they give you hair, makeup, the works.

209
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,180
打扮成灰姑娘肯定很好玩
Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

210
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,080
-我也想当灰姑娘  -对啊
- Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too. - Yeah.

211
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,330
我们不能都当灰姑娘
We can't all be Cinderella.

212
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,610
那要怎么决定呢
Then how do we decide?

213
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,740
很简单
Well, it's simple.

214
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,010
这是我的主意
This was my idea.

215
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,050
开车的是我
I'm driving.

216
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,950
所以我是灰姑娘
I'm Cinderella.

217
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,520
你们两个小贱货要是有意见
You bitches got a problem with that,

218
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,720
我们现在就可以停车
we could stop the car right now.

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,900
不好意思  我约了女生在这里见面
Excuse me, I'm meeting a girl here.

220
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,170
这是我们的第一次约会
It's kind of our first date.

221
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,620
在图书馆吗
In a library?

222
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,190
我和她都有些不擅长社交
She and I are both a little awkward in social situations,

223
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,580
所以这里挺好的
so this seemed like a good idea.

224
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,350
也常有人说我挺怪的
People say I'm a little awkward, too.

225
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,840
我能加入你们吗
May I join you?

226
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,020
不行
No, you can't join us.

227
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,940
你赶紧走开
Just go-go climb back up

228
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,290
从哪儿来回哪儿去
whatever beanstalk you came down from.

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,640
你可以找到更好的
You can do better.

230
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,210
我们要在这里吃吗
Oh, we're eating here?

231
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,600
这是短信约会吗
We're having a texting date?

232
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,590
<i>我喜欢</i>
<i>I love that.</i>

233
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>你看短信的时候要记得</i>
<i>As you're reading, it will help to remember</i>

234
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,580
<i>我有超可爱的口音哦</i>
<i>I have an adorable accent.</i>

235
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,900
好  大家准备好来个科学之旅了吗
Okay, who's ready for some science?

236
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,290
我也是
Me, too.

237
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,610
我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

238
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,610
这是我的朋友库珀博士
I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper

239
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,120
和真正的宇航员霍华德·沃罗威茨
and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz,

240
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,490
我们会为你们展现
and we are going to show you girls

241
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,150
科学工作会有多酷
how cool a job in science can be.

242
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,590
你们问有多酷[冷]是吗
How cool, you ask?

243
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,700
大概有零下273度[绝对零度]
Well, how about negative 273 degrees,

244
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,560
热力学函数
因为那是熵达到其最小值时的温度
'cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value.

245
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,200
我刚才是开心地学到新知识了吗
Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it?

246
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,050
还有这种好事
What?

247
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,180
很好
All right!

248
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,210
现在有请理论物理学家
So now let's bring out theoretical physicist

249
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,620
谢尔顿·库珀博士
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

250
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,390
你们好  女孩子们
Hello, female children.

251
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,300
请允许我用一个
Allow me to inspire you

252
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,030
伟大的女性科学家的故事来激励你们
with a story about a great female scientist.

253
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,580
在波兰出生  在法国接受教育的
Polish-born, French-educated

254
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,000
居里夫人
Madame Curie.

255
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,880
她是放射线的发现人之一
Codiscoverer of radioactivity,

256
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,340
是科学界的英雄
she was a hero of science...

257
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,680
直到她的头发掉光
until her hair fell out;

258
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,080
吐血和大便带血
her vomit and stool became filled with blood...

259
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,660
她被自己的发现毒死了
and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery.

260
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,860
只要勤奋努力
With a little hard work,

261
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,470
你们一定都能获得她的成果
I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you.

262
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,640
结束了没  我们能走了吗
Are we done? Can we go?

263
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,400
重要的是
The thing to remember is

264
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,650
你们也可以去外太空
you can go to outer space, too.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,510
瞧瞧我
I mean, look at me.

266
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,880
我以前就是这个学校的学生
I went to this very school.

267
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,290
你们坐着的其中一张课桌
Those desks you're sitting in,

268
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,030
我曾经被人用强力胶粘在上面过
I was once superglued to one of them.

269
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,160
你去月球了吗
Did you go to the moon?

270
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,020
没有  但我确实去了
No, but I did go to

271
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,570
国际太空站
the International Space Station.

272
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,310
你驾驶火箭了吗
Did you fly the rocket?

273
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,400
没有
No,

274
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,450
但我确实乘坐了火箭
but I was in the rocket.

275
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,270
我没有
I didn't actually...

276
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,880
所以你就是飞而已  和我叔叔很像
So you just flew around? That's kind of like my uncle.

277
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,770
他是个空乘员
He's a flight attendant.

278
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,750
不
No...

279
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,280
我是美国的英雄
I'm an American hero.

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,280
而你叔叔只会让人抓狂
Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?

281
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,820
我们学到了很多是吧
Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh?

282
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
谢谢你  霍华德宇航员
Thank you, Astronaut Howard.

283
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,070
我是一名实验物理学家
Um, I am what's called an experimental physicist,

284
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,700
我的工作特别好玩  因为我能测试证明理论
which is super-fun, because I get to test theories

285
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,320
工作还能跟激光打交道
and work with lasers.

286
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,390
请讲
Yes?

287
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,470
你是怎么决定当个科学家的
How did you decide to become a scientist?

288
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,240
这问题提得好
Uh, excellent question.

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,110
我从小就喜欢科学
Um, I suppose I've always been into science, you know...

290
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,930
我的妈妈爸爸都是科学家
My mother and father are scientists,

291
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,650
所以他们一直引导我走上这条路
so I was kind of led in that direction.

292
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,750
我是被逼的  这种形容更恰当
Eh, pushed might be a better way to describe it.

293
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,520
说句实话
To be honest with you guys,

294
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,820
我在你们这么大的时候
when I was your age,

295
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,690
我想当的是说唱明星
I wanted to be a rap star.

296
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,320
像史诺普·道格一样
Like Snoop Dogg,
史诺普·道格  美国说唱歌手
犯有私藏枪支和大麻罪

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,150
但是对警方更为尊重
but with a healthy respect for the police.

298
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,050
没关系  你们笑吧
Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

299
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,680
我妈也笑了
Just like my mother did.

300
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,550
* 我对她坦诚相告 *
* After I confided, *

301
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,920
* 她对我责备嘲笑 *
* I was derided and chided, *

302
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,210
* 我们俩碰撞引爆 *
* my moms and I collided. *

303
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,620
* 她说我路走歪掉 *
* She said my dreams were misguided. *

304
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,070
随便即兴说唱两句
That's just a little freestyle.

305
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,620
<i>我爸爸是印度的妇科医生</i>
<i>My dad's a gynecologist in India,</i>

306
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,330
<i>如果你去了印度  需要检查一下</i>
<i>so if you're over there and need a check-up,</i>

307
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,070
子宫cervix与服务service音似
原意是"为你效劳"
<i>用他的话来说  他愿意"检查你的子宫"</i>
<i>as he likes to say, he's "at your cervix."</i>

308
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,370
<i>太坏了</i>
<i>That's terrible.</i>

309
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,740
penitentiary是监狱  但pun-itentiary则是双关语监狱
<i>你爸爸该被送进"双关"监狱</i>
<i>Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.</i>

310
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,780
<i>真是个合适的[双关]惩罚</i>
<i>That's a fitting pun-ishment.</i>

311
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,370
<i>我还不知道你的工作呢</i>
<i>I still don't know what you do for a living.</i>

312
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,090
<i>网页设计</i>
<i>Web design.</i>

313
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,180
<i>有我可能看过的网页吗</i>
<i>Anything I might have seen?</i>

314
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,360
<i>我不知道</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

315
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,110
<i>你浏览过色情网站吗</i>
<i>You ever look at porn web sites?</i>

316
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,140
<i>从来没有</i>
<i>No, never.</i>

317
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,670
那是什么</i>
What is porn?</i>

318
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,920
<i>不好意思  自动纠错功能</i>
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

319
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,130
<i>我本来打的是</i>
<i>That was supposed to say</i>

320
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,570
<i>"舞会网站"</i>
<i>"Prom Web sites."</i>

321
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,480
<i>真有趣  我喜欢舞会</i>
<i>Ooh, fun. I love prom.</i>

322
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,540
<i>气氛浪漫  锦衣华服</i>
<i>The romance, the gowns,</i>

323
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,090
<i>简直就像童话成真了</i>
<i>it's like a fairy tale come to life.</i>

324
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,550
<i>不好意思  自动纠错功能</i>
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

325
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,930
<i>我本来打的是</i>
<i>That was supposed to say,</i>

326
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,120
<i>"我喜欢运动"</i>
<i>"I like sports."</i>

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,500
我从来都不想拉大提琴
I never wanted to play the cello.

328
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,070
拉大提琴怎么泡得到女孩啊
How do you meet girls playing the cello?

329
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,870
"你想来我家
"Hey, you want to come over to my house

330
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,020
听我演奏一种乐器吗
and listen to me play an instrument

331
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,790
那听起来像大黄蜂自杀的声音哦"
that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"

332
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,660
赶紧去拉响火警报警器
Quick, pull the fire alarm.

333
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,110
好让咱们趁机溜走
Let's get out of here.

334
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,620
各位  再次问好
Uh, hello again.

335
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,400
我不知道是不是所有的女人
Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general

336
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,260
都被人主动劝阻过
have been actively discouraged

337
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,110
不要追求科学
from pursuing the sciences,

338
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,650
但很显然  今天你们这些女孩都被劝阻了
but it's clear you young women here, today, have been.

339
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,320
我听着我同事们废话连篇浪费你们的时间
While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time,

340
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,790
我突然想到  如果让真实的科学女强人
it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful

341
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,090
为你们讲述女人投身科学的事迹
to hear about women in science

342
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,660
这样也许更有意义
from actual women in science,

343
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,670
我碰巧认识两位科学女强人
and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples

344
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,940
她们同意现在和你们进行电话交流
who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now.

345
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,690
罗斯滕科夫斯基博士
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski,

346
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,450
福勒博士  你们在吗
Dr. Fowler, are you there?

347
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,960
我们在
We're here.

348
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,900
感谢两位在百忙之中抽出宝贵的时间
Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule

349
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,550
来启发年轻的女孩子们
to enlighten these young women.

350
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,390
乐意之至
It's our pleasure.

351
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,790
白雪公主
我是福勒博士  神经科学家
I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.

352
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,710
我是罗森考斯基·沃罗维茨博士
And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz,
灰姑娘

353
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,020
微生物学家
and I'm a microbiologist.

354
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,030
科学世界需要更多女性
The world of science needs more women,

355
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,370
但女孩们从小就被教导成
but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care

356
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,360
更在乎自己的外貌
more about the way we look

357
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,700
而不是头脑的力量
than about the power of our minds.

358
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,540
是的
That's true.

359
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,190
你们每一个人都有能力
Every one of you has the capacity

360
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,340
成为自己想当的人
to be anything you want to be.

361
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,650
睡美人
但想当灰姑娘就不行
Unless you want to be Cinderella.

362
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,090
来单挑啊
Come at me.

363
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,920
看看谁厉害
See what happens.

364
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,360
<i>今天真的很好玩</i>
<i>This was really fun.</i>

365
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,470
我的手机要没电了  我就用说的吧
My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk.

366
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,500
谢谢今天你约我出来
Thanks for today.

367
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,350
我一直试着做更多让我害怕的事情
I've been trying to do more things that scare me,

368
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,090
来这和你约会绝对是其中之一
and coming here was definitely one of them.

369
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,020
但今天真挺不错的
But it was also really nice.

370
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,360
所以  谢谢
So thanks, and, um,

371
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,130
我打算走了
I'm gonna go.

372
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,650
也许我在离开前
Maybe I could do one more scary thing

373
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,810
能再做一件可怕的事  和你吻别
before I go and give you a kiss good-bye?

374
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,980
如果你同意的话
You know, if that's okay.

375
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,270
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

376
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,270
恐慌症发作  下次吧
Panic attack! Maybe next time.

377
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,050
我就把这算做前戏了
I'm counting that as foreplay.

378
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,610
妮妮  我回家了
Bernie, I'm home.

379
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,310
你今天玩的开心吗
You have fun today?

380
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,600
开心  而且我为你准备了惊喜
Yes, and I have a surprise for you.

381
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,030
一定要是灰姑娘  一定要是灰姑娘
Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.

382
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,010
你好啊  白马王子
Well, hello, Prince Charming.

383
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,210
小姐
Milady.

384
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,900
你今天...  什么情况
Hey, how was your... what?

385
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,970
我能解释
I can explain.

386
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,290
我和姑娘们翘班
I played hooky with the girls,

387
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,850
一起去了迪士尼乐园  然后...
then we all went to Disneyland and got...

388
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,070
你在干什么呢
What are you doing?

389
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,830
迪士尼乐园嘛  继续说  我听着呢
Disneyland. Go on, I'm listening.

390
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,390
谢尔顿  白雪公主只需要
Sheldon, all Snow White needs

391
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,050
轻轻一吻就能醒来哦
is one little kiss to wake up.

392
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,350
你说第一次时我就听见了
Heard you the first time.
