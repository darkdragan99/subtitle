1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,780
弄好可以也烫下我的制服吗
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,300
哟  真有意思
Yeah, w... interesting.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,010
你还记得我们这段对话吗
Do you recall this conversation?

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,380
"莱纳德  要不要跟我摊挂烫机的钱"
"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?"

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,090
"不要  谢尔顿  我们又用不到"
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,900
看来有人现在自食恶果了吧
Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.
字面意  乱毛小鸡返巢歇息啦

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,580
这是你要的化妆海绵
Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,530
谢啦  我本来以为我还有不少
Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,300
靠  你的化妆品比我还多
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,420
而且还比我用的都高级
You've got better makeup than I do.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,710
这个老娘借了
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,990
这是我动漫大会专用化妆品
This is my Comic-Con makeup.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,380
我爱你  但有些东西是男子汉们
I love you, but there are some things

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,940
不能与女友分享的
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,290
十分明智的原则
That's a wise policy.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,350
我曾为化装比赛借用了我妹妹的化妆品
I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,200
结果被传染到红眼病
Got a terrible case of pinkeye.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,060
幸好那年我刚好是想化装成僵尸
Yeah, but luckily, I was going as a zombie.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,640
因此还赢得了第二名呢
I won second place.

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,790
你们不是才去过动漫大会吗
I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,050
上次是圣地亚哥动漫大会
That was San Diego Comic-Con.

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,200
这次是贝克尔斯菲动漫大会
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,110
这次的有比较好吗
Is that better?

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,050
其实规模小了很多
Well, it's a lot smaller.

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,330
但重心主要放在漫画书上
It's more about the comic books.

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,640
以前传统的大会都是这样
The way these conventions used to be

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,330
而不是像现在的好莱坞电影潮
before they went all Hollywood.

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,450
简单扼要地回答你  这场没比较好
So to answer your question, no, it's not better.

29
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,120
那你们干嘛还去啊
Well, then why are you going?

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,980
始终还是漫画大会
It's a comic book convention.

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,190
就如同披萨或粒子加速器一样嘛
You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators,

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,600
就算做得不好  也还是可以接受
even the stinky one's still pretty good.

33
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,740
好吧
All right.

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,830
那祝你们玩得开心
Well, you guys have fun.

35
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,100
那估计是周日晚再见了吧
I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

36
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,060
-是的  行
- Yeah. - Okay.

37
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,440
你等一下
Oh, hang on a second.

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,600
举着这个
Hold this.

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
这是干嘛
What was that for?

40
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,370
作为别人不信我有美女女友时的证据
To show people when they don't believe me.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,390
生活大爆炸 第六季  第十三集

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,580
这样最爽了
Oh, this is the best.

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,380
如果你平日吃早餐时配酒喝
You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday,

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,480
人家会说你酗酒
you got a problem.

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,340
但如果是周末这样  就能推说是早午餐
You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.

46
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,140
谢尔顿不爱早午餐这套
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

47
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,370
他无法忍受吃饭时
He can't stand being at a table

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,690
一边有人在吃早餐煎蛋卷
where one person's having an omelet

49
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,930
而另一边有人在吃午餐三明治
and another person's having a sandwich.

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,980
他真是不厌其"烦"啊
He's not exhausting at all.

51
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,990
莱纳德发的短信  说他们在路上了
It's Leonard, he says they're on the road

52
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,450
正"曲速前进"贝克尔斯菲市呢
and headed for Bakersfield at "warp speed."
科幻电影中  运用空间翘曲  以快于光速的几个数量级的速度航行

53
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,290
可能这含羞草鸡尾酒上头
Maybe it's the Mimosa,

54
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,570
但我就大发慈悲给他回个"哈哈哈"吧
but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,680
他们兴奋这些事的样子真可爱
It's cute how excited they are.

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,950
你们应该看看霍华德
You should have seen Howard

57
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,710
为了参加大会  缝了整周服装的样子
sewing his costume all week for the convention.

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
霍华德什么时候学的缝纫啊
When did Howard learn to sew?

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,350
他小时候  每隔几个月
When he was a little boy, every couple months,

60
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,260
都要帮他妈把旧裤子重新缝大一点
he would have to let his mom's pants out.

61
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,630
我真不知道他们为什么会去这些大会
I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.

62
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,310
对啊
I know.

63
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,850
他们四个都在知名大学工作
The four of them work at a major university.

64
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,010
他们都超级聪明
They're all super smart.

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,530
怎么会还在痴迷12岁小孩的玩意呢
How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?

66
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,970
我是不介意啦
I don't mind it.

67
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,270
我觉得霍华德只是内心有孩子气的一面
I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child.

68
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,370
不过有时候他穿着蝙蝠侠睡衣上床时
Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas,

69
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,720
我都感觉是其实他就是个小孩
sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,310
可能是因为他们从小被欺负到大吧
It's probably because they were bullied growing up.

71
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,080
在一个人自身无力反抗时
In a world where you can't fight back,

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,820
超级英雄能满足他们心中的愿望
superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,380
现在我对自己欺负过的那些人感到内疚
Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids.

74
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,660
但我也要替自己辩驳
Although, in my defense,

75
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,630
当年丹尼·比佛要不想被欺负得满嘴泥
if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt,

76
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,660
就不该戴着一个欠扁的蠢领结来上学
he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,010
我没有看过漫画书呢  你们呢
I've never even read a comic book. You guys?

78
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,240
-没  -没有过
- Uh-uh. - No.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,150
这东西对他们生命那么重要
I mean, it's such an important part of their lives.

80
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,730
我们也许该去试着看看啊
Maybe we should try reading some.

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,130
你说真的吗
Seriously?

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,300
漫画店离这里也不远啊
The comic book store isn't far from here.

83
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,120
这主意太棒了
That is an amazing idea.

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,420
靠  我是喝了多少杯啦
Okay, how many of these have I had?

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,520
我觉得你该开卫星导航器
I think you should turn on the GPS.

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,750
开了啊
It is on.

87
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,910
可你没开语音导航功能
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

88
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,380
你要是打开那个
I know I'd feel more safe

89
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,250
我会感觉到加倍安心呢
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

90
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,140
我爱死语音导航功能了
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

91
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,180
真的只开了10英里而已吗
Has it really only been ten miles?

92
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,940
为了让你闭嘴  我现在就开
I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.

93
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,940
莱纳德  向左转
Leonard, bear left

94
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,600
沿着210洲际公路继续前行
and continue on Interstate 210.

95
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,150
语音导航的那人听起来很懂行啊
Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about.

96
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,310
我要是你  一定会洗耳恭听的
I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.

97
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,130
你对导航器干嘛了
What did you do?

98
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,010
我网上找到了个破解软件
I found a hack online.

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,860
能让我把自己录制的声音档
I was able to upload MP3 recordings

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,090
上传到你的导航器
of my voice to your GPS.

101
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,290
这太酷了
That is so cool.

102
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,260
反对  一点都不酷
Counterpoint, no, it's not.

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,130
继续沿着210洲际公路
Continue on Interstate 210

104
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,890
前行5英里
for five miles.

105
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,530
以下是一则关于洲际公路的有趣小知识
Here's an interesting fact about interstates.

106
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
你不是吧
Really?

107
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,090
别吵  人家说是有趣小知识呢
Shh, he said it's interesting.

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,540
洲际公路数字命名的规则是
Interstates are numbered as follows.

109
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,070
偶数公路走东西向
Even-numbered routes run east and west,

110
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,330
奇数公路走南北向
odd-numbered routes run north and south.

111
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,340
三位数公路表示环绕郊区
Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses

112
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,530
或支路
or spurs.

113
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,660
瞧  莱纳德  那有座桥
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.

114
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,430
冲出去死了算了
Drive off it.

115
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,190
我们离华斯克巨岩公园不远了
You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.

116
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,480
《星际迷航》有很多集都是在那里拍的
Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.

117
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,580
我们的化装服就在车里
We've got our costumes in the trunk.

118
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,090
我们可以去那里  拍几张照片
We could go there and have a little photo shoot.

119
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,480
好主意
Great idea.

120
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,780
我两周没碰过碳水化合物了
I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks.

121
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,020
瘦得颧骨都凸起来了  不赶紧拍照
These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera

122
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,400
不然一块椒盐卷饼下肚  就打回原形了
before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

123
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,200
好啊  听起来不错
Yeah, that sounds fun.

124
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,950
好极了
Oh, smashing.

125
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,790
-莱纳德  那你知道怎么去吗  -不知道
- Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there? - No.

126
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,680
幸好车上有人知道
Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,690
重新计算路程
Recalculating.

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,240
在等待的同时
While we're waiting,

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,460
你知道是哪一任总统将
do you know which president signed

130
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,370
《洲际公路系统法案》签署成为法律吗
the Intestate Highway System Act into law?

131
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,040
答案将在14英里后公布
The answer, coming up in 14 miles.

132
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,980
你们肯定都猜不出来
None of you will get it.

133
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,690
是艾森豪威尔[美国第三十四任总统]
It's Eisenhower.

134
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,060
他们干嘛盯着我们看
Why are they staring?

135
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,850
哪要理由
Who cares?

136
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,790
好好享受就行了
Just soak it in.

137
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,920
你们好呀
Hello, boys.

138
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,890
拜托不要盯着看  不过是女生而已
Could you please stop staring? They're just girls.

139
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,110
你们又不是没在电影或漫画里见过
It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.

140
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,720
斯尔图特
Hey, Stuart.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,160
什么风把你们吹来了
Wh-What brings you guys here?

142
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,640
我们想听听你对漫画书的建议
We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.

143
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,050
我的建议是  千万不要以卖漫画书为生
Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.

144
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,670
不是啦  我们只是好奇
No, we were just wondering

145
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,040
为什么男生这么喜欢看漫画
why the guys like this stuff so much,

146
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,410
所以我们想试试看
so we thought we'd give it a try.

147
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,720
好的  你们觉得自己可能会喜欢什么类型
Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into?

148
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,470
超级英雄漫画  奇幻漫画  漫画小说  日本漫画
Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga--

149
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,270
再盯人家我就拿水管喷死你们
I swear I will turn a hose on you.

150
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,160
那咱家几个都喜欢什么类型的漫画
What kind of comics do the guys like?

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,150
什么类型都会看一点
Um, a little bit of everything.

152
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,700
大部分是超级英雄系列的
Mostly superhero stuff.

153
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,880
好吧  那谁是最厉害的超级英雄
All right, well, who's the best superhero?

154
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,750
你不能在这里问这种问题
You can't ask a question like that in here.

155
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,770
你是想挑起宅男骂战吗
Are you trying to start a rumble?

156
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,410
那你推荐什么
Well, what do you recommend?

157
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,740
我想想
Well, uh, let's see.

158
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,750
有阳光帅气的基本款英雄
You've got your basic clean-cut good guys--

159
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,520
《超人》  《蜘蛛侠》  《美国队长》
Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America.

160
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,590
有黑暗系的另类英雄
Then you have your darker anti-heroes--

161
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,750
《蝙蝠侠》  《金刚狼》  《惩罚者》
your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.

162
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,930
哇  我还就喜欢坏小子
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

163
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,430
你那怕仓鼠的男友  就是最好的"证明"啊
As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.

164
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,970
如果我是你  我会选《成人童话》第一集
If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one.

165
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,400
画风复杂精致
The artwork is sophisticated,

166
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,610
情节千回百转
it's intelligently written,

167
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,840
而且没有物化或有女性刻板印象
and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
哇  《雷神》
Ooh, Thor!

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,370
他真性感
He's hot.

170
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,680
对啊  的确是
Yeah, he kind of is.

171
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,000
再上点粉
And we're blending,

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,850
再上点粉
and we're blending,

173
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,220
大功告成
and we're done.

174
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,700
我知道数据机器人不应该笑
I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile,

175
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,530
但我要笑一个
but here it comes.

176
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,300
来吧  伙计们  开拍啦
Come on, guys. Let's do this.

177
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,840
快点  我出汗出得秃头套都要掉了
Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.

178
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,880
我们第一个造型要摆什么
So what's our first pose going to be?

179
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,670
先摆一个《星际迷航》的经典打斗场面吧
I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.

180
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,420
我去设定时
I'll set the timer.

181
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,480
谢尔顿  你这算哪门子的打斗姿势
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?

182
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,070
数据机器人的武器就是脑子
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

183
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,910
我正挥舞它呢
I'm wielding it.

184
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,560
相位枪对准博格人
Phasers on the Borg!

185
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
《霹雳娇娃》姿势
Charlie's Angels.

186
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,110
好的  下一个是什么
Okay, what's next?

187
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,670
我们拍几辑性感魅力的照片
Now let's do some sexy glamour shots.

188
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,470
我来挑动气氛
I'll set the mood.

189
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,190
好  这张好
Yeah, nice one.

190
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,240
就这样
That's right.

191
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,780
天啊
Oh, my God.

192
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,700
莱纳德  有人在偷你的车
Leonard, someone's stealing your car!

193
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,140
什么  喂  喂
What? Hey, hey!

194
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,470
回来  别走
Come back here! Stop!

195
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,030
偷车是犯法的
Stealing is against the law!

196
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,790
真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

197
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,360
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,180
我打电话报警
I'll call 911.

199
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,130
糟糕
Wha...

200
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,580
不是吧  我的手机在其他裤子里
Oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.

201
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,350
-我的也是  -我也是
- Oh, so is mine. - Mine, too.

202
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,970
有人有办法吗
Anybody got any ideas?

203
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,180
没有
Nope.

204
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,950
唯一能做的事就是怪罪某人
The only thing left to do now is assign blame.

205
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,490
都怪你
Nice going.

206
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,580
谁会在光天化日之下公然偷走别人的车啊
What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?

207
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
谁会把车钥匙留在车里不拿走啊
What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?

208
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,380
不是说好都怪库萨帕里了吗
I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.

209
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,620
你说得对
You're right.

210
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,080
都怪你
Nice going.

211
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,010
有车
Car.

212
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,400
这些人怎么搞的  干嘛不停车
What is wrong with people? Why don't they stop?

213
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,930
也许这样更好
Maybe we're better off.

214
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,630
万一我们上了神经病的车就惨了
You know, what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?

215
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,330
照照镜子吧  谢尔顿
Look at us, Sheldon.

216
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,890
我们就是神经病
We're the crazy people.

217
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,240
也许我们该举个牌子
Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,100
告诉来往车辆我们的精神很正常
that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.

219
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,330
这主意真棒  那你还不赶紧做牌子
Good idea. Why don't you get started on that?

220
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,690
算了  咱们用走的吧
Come on, let's just start walking.

221
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,800
这附近肯定有加油站之类的
There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.

222
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,580
就因为你穿着船长的制服
What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform,

223
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,930
你就能发号施令了是吗
you're in charge?

224
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,570
是的
Yes.

225
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,190
好吧
All right.

226
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,150
我看完了
Hmm, okay, I'm done.

227
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,490
你们怎么看得那么快
How did you guys finish so fast?

228
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,110
大部分都只是图片啊
I don't know, there were a lot of pictures,

229
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,780
有一页上甚至只写了一句"受死吧"
and one page only had the word "Brakkadoom!"

230
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,470
行  聪明人脑子快  可我有街头智慧
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.

231
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,010
你们怎么看
So, what'd you guys think?

232
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,660
书里有许多打斗场景
Well, there was a lot of action,

233
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,460
情节跌宕起伏
and the story moved along at a brisk pace.

234
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,210
总体来说
It was, overall...

235
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,080
我该怎么形容呢
what's the word I'm looking for?

236
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,910
-蠢  -超蠢的
- Stupid? - So stupid.

237
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,930
真不知道莱纳德怎么会对这玩意这么着迷
I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.

238
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,430
太荒唐了  他们竟然花大量的时间
It's crazy; they spend hours

239
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,610
讨论这些虚无缥缈的东西
arguing about things that don't even exist.

240
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,310
-真是浪费光阴  -可不是嘛
- What a waste of time. - I know.

241
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,030
什么一把重到只有雷神才举得起的铁锤啊
A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?

242
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,600
我觉得不是因为它重
I don't think it's heavy.

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
而是铁锤上有某种魔法
I think it's some sort of magic,

244
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,670
所以只有雷神才能举起它
so only Thor can lift it.

245
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,820
这更说不通啊
That makes even less sense, I mean...

246
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,340
不不  就应该是这样
No, no, no, it doesn't.

247
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,430
雷神是神
Thor is a god.

248
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,750
铁锤是他的  只有他能用
The hammer is his; only he can use it.

249
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,710
就像谢尔顿和他的牙刷
It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,290
或者谢尔顿和他那两片诱人薄唇
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

251
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,430
等一下
Okay, hang on,

252
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,420
要是雷神正拿着铁锤呢
what if Thor's hand is on the hammer?

253
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,320
如果他正拿着铁锤发力
I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic,

254
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,040
那是不是我也可以拿起它
does that mean I could lift it?

255
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,650
-不是  -是的
- No. - Yes.

256
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,210
到底怎样
Well, which is it?

257
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,070
我们是不是漏了什么细节
Maybe we missed something.

258
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,290
再看一遍吧
Let's read it again.

259
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,020
-好吧  -行
- Okay. - Yeah.

260
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,430
想喝点茶吗
You want some tea?

261
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,220
好主意  我帮你
Good idea. I'll help you.

262
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,050
不是要一起再看一遍吗
Wait, I thought we were reading.

263
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,200
要的
We are.

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,780
你先开始吧  我们晚点不要紧
We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

265
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,730
真希望我妈妈在这儿
I wish my mom was here.

266
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,300
我们就都可以在她的影子下乘凉了
We could all hang out in her shadow.

267
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,350
漫漫沙漠行  毛裤贴我身
Wool pants in the desert.

268
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,300
熊熊烈日下  蛋蛋火上蒸
I feel like I've got poached testicles.

269
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,700
可怜的你啊
Oh, you poor thing;

270
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,810
瞧你那汗流的
you're sweating.

271
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,540
可真是比车被人偷了还可怜
That's so much worse than having your car stolen.

272
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,450
保险公司会赔你辆新车
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.

273
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,670
请问谁能赔我大雕
It's not gonna de-funk my junk.

274
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,730
先生们
Gentlemen,

275
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,760
不要再满腹牢骚了
a little less bellyaching.

276
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,290
我们是星际舰队的军官
We're Starfleet officers

277
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,430
是博格集合体的一份子
and a member of the Borg Collective.

278
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,490
谢尔顿  拜托  我现在真没心情入戏
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

279
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,890
莱纳德
Leonard,

280
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,200
我们一直都在梦想
all our lives we have dreamed

281
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,380
进入我们所挚爱的幻想世界
of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love.

282
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,070
看看现在的我们
And look at us.

283
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,090
现在我们真正成为了
At this moment, we are, in fact,

284
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,000
星际迷航的先遣登陆队
a Star Trek landing party

285
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,100
被困于荒芜凋敝的陌生环境
stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment,

286
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,950
只能依靠自己的智慧  坚毅
relying only on our wits, our fortitude

287
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,610
和勇气
and our moxie.

288
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,680
只要我们有这些品质
As long as we have those things,

289
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,340
-没有什么可以阻止  -书呆子
- nothing can stop... - Nerds!

290
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,030
我恨死这星球了
I hate this planet.

291
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,460
看  铁锤上写着呢
It says right here on the hammer,

292
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,900
"只要是配得上的人手持铁锤
"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

293
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,680
均可获得雷神的神力"
shall possess the power of Thor."

294
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,510
等一下  谁能决定他是否配得上
Hold on, who decides who's worthy?

295
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,900
是铁锤决定吗
Does the hammer decide?

296
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,030
-是的  -不是
- Yes! - No!

297
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,710
它无法决定
It can't decide.

298
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,410
它只是个铁锤
It's a hammer.

299
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,140
是你说它有魔力的
You said it's a magic hammer.

300
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,960
对  但它不能做决定啊
Yeah, it can't make decisions.

301
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,350
哈利·波特的魔杖都能选主人
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,

302
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,320
雷神的铁锤凭什么不行
why can't Thor's hammer?

303
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,610
你要是非要拿魔杖和铁锤比
Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers,

304
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,800
那我没啥话好对你说了
I can't even take you seriously.

305
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,290
你好
Hello.

306
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,890
你好
Hello.

307
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,320
请倒四杯水
Uh, four glasses of water, please.

308
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,940
你们要什么吗
Anything for you guys?

309
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,960
能借电话用一下吗  我们的车被偷了
Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.

310
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,620
你们怎么不叫史考特传送你们上舰啊
Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?
《星际迷航》角色

311
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,740
史考特是第一代系列人物
Scotty was on the original series,

312
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,530
而我们是《下一代》的
and we're Next Generation.

313
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,990
所以...
So...

314
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,750
糗的是你们
joke's on you.

315
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,330
我们跟他不是一起的
We're not with him.

316
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,980
你不能在外太空拿起任何东西
You can't pick something up in outer space.

317
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,770
-在太空里根本就没有"起"的概念  -是吗
- In space, there is no up. - Oh, yeah?

318
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,570
那为什么每天太阳都会升"起"呢
Then how does the sun come "Up" every day?

319
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,860
很难反驳如此的街头"智慧"啊
Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.

320
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,320
莱纳德和谢尔顿有成箱的漫画书在对面屋
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall.

321
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
我们为何不过去找找答案
Why don't we go look at those?

322
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,240
很好  这样你们就会发现
Oh, great! Yes! And then you will see.

323
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,000
我没错  因为如果我们在外太空
I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space,

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,490
任何人都有可能举起锤子
then anyone could pick up the hammer

325
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,460
因为在失重环境下  它是漂浮在空中的
because it would be floating around in a weightless environment.

326
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,580
没错  看书慢的人也懂科学
Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science.

327
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,020
去死吧
Suck on that.

328
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,870
车里有什么值钱的东西
Was there anything valuable in the car?

329
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,480
衣服  钱包  手机
Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

330
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,450
还有价值三百美元的化妆品
And about $300 worth of makeup,

331
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,630
所以现在偷车贼可以化妆成任何样子
so this thief could look like anyone right now.

332
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,230
化妆品
Makeup?

333
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,040
不奇怪
Sure.

334
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,580
我们本打算去贝克尔斯菲的动漫大会
Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.

335
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,220
那里有个大型的化装比赛
They have a big costume contest.

336
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,570
其实没听起来那么蠢啦
It's cooler than it sounds.

337
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,220
还好  听起来还挺酷啊
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

338
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,740
本来就很酷
I-It is.

339
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,850
那里不仅只有漫画书
It's not just comic books.

340
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,580
还有人偶  玩具
They've got action figures, toys,

341
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,120
还有"电子世界争霸战"主题舞会
a Tron-themed dance party...

342
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,820
行了  他已经了解有多酷了
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

343
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,890
我要问的都问完了
I think I have all I need here.

344
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,550
需要我帮你们联络谁吗
You guys need me to call someone?

345
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,390
我猜应该是你们妈妈吧
I'm guessing your moms?

346
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,390
多谢  我们自己能搞定
Thanks, but we've got it covered.

347
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,800
好了  我刚跟我妈通完电话
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

348
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,150
她帮我们租了辆车
She arranged for us to get a rental car.

349
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,000
太好了
Great.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
我们还可以去动漫大会
We can still make it to Comic-Con.

351
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

352
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,210
遭了这么多罪  我现在只想回家
After all we've been through, I just want to go home.

353
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,610
别这样嘛
Don't be like that.

354
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,980
拜托  霍华德  劝劝他
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

355
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,480
我支持莱纳德
I'm with Leonard.

356
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,510
我受够了
I'm done.

357
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,150
好吧  那看来是二对二了
Fine, then I guess it's two against two.

358
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,550
怎么决定
How do we decide?

359
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,680
事实上  是三对一
Actually, it's three against one.

360
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,560
什么
What?!

361
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
那任务怎么办
What about the mission?

362
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,790
是你说我们是现实中的先遣登陆队
You said we were a real-life landing party.

363
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,190
我们不是
Yeah, well, we're not.

364
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,940
我们是幻想的先遣登陆队
We're an imaginary landing party

365
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,860
在现实中被人丢垃圾
who had real-life garbage thrown at us

366
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,400
现实中陌生人认为我们是白痴
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

367
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,140
跟你说实话
And to tell you the truth,

368
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,440
我开始觉得自己像白痴了
I'm starting to feel like one.

369
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,930
我现在就想回家
I want to go home now.

370
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,520
好吧
Okay.

371
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,610
那我们好歹从进取公司租车吧
Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise?
《星际迷航》中有一艘叫进取号的星舰

372
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,110
懂吗  进取号哟
Get it? Enterprise?

373
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,650
去死吧  明明很好笑
Screw you. That's funny.

374
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
那绿巨人在雷神举着锤子时
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor

375
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,730
把他连人带锤举起来  那会怎么样
while Thor is holding the hammer?

376
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,520
会怎样
Yeah?

377
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
这样根据传递性质
Then by the transitive property of picking things up,

378
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,860
就是绿巨人举起了锤子
Hulk picked up the hammer.

379
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,060
不
No.

380
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,450
是绿巨人举起了雷神  雷神举起了锤子
Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.

381
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,460
等等
Okay, hang on.

382
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,380
如果我去酒吧勾搭[举起]了一个男的
If I go to a bar and pick up a guy,

383
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,940
他又勾搭了一个女的  然后我们仨一起离开
and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together,

384
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,000
那那个女的算是我勾搭上的吗
did I pick up the girl?

385
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,340
这是真事吗
Did that ever happen?

386
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,530
喂  是讨论我还是讨论雷神啊
Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?

387
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,900
要我说  这是我们最后一次出门
Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.

388
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,030
看这里
Look, right here.

389
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,860
红巨人举起了雷神的锤子
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer

390
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,750
因为雷神拿着锤子
'cause Thor's touching it.

391
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,020
不  因为他们在外太空
No, it's because they're in space.

392
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,710
而且他只是碰到了带子
He's really just touching the strap.

393
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,980
带子是锤子的一部分
The strap is part of the hammer!

394
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
不是的
No, it's not!

395
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,370
她们是在争论漫画书的内容吗
Are they actually arguing about comic books?

396
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,190
不  这不可能是真的
No, that can't be right.

397
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,880
也许"雷神之锤"
Maybe "Thor's Hammer"

398
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
是新的指甲油颜色
is a new color of nail polish.

399
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,460
红巨人肯定是配得上锤子
Then Red Hulk must be worthy.

400
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,530
红巨人怎么配得上啊
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

401
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,600
你又不了解他的生平
You don't know his life!

402
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,190
只有一个合理的解释了
There's only one logical explanation.

403
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,790
在沙漠的某处
Somewhere in the desert

404
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,700
我们穿越到另一个平行空间了
we crossed into an alternate dimension...

405
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,140
在这个空间  我们生活中的女性
where the women in our lives

406
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,840
终于懂得欣赏真正的伟大著作了
can finally appreciate great literature.

407
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,650
如果这是平行空间
If it's an alternate dimension...

408
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,820
听起来先遣登陆队可以执行任务了
sounds like a job for a landing party.

409
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,690
舰长  有何指令
Captain, what are your orders?

410
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,500
