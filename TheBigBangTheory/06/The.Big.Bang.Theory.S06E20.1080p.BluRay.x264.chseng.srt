1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,190
有一种永生不死的水母
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,030
它会从性成熟回复到幼虫无性阶段
Instead, it reverts to its asexual state

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,540
然后重新变性成熟
and then grows up again.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,170
我家以为我们90岁的姥爷
We thought my 90-year-old grandfather

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,720
也转回了无性状态
had reverted to an asexual state,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,600
直到他的牙买加裔看护员告上法庭
but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,630
证明了我们都错了
proved us all wrong.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,640
我想说的是  永生不再是空想
My point is, immortality is not only a possibility,

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,600
能成为现实了
it is real.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,900
除非你是个水母
Only if you're this jellyfish

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,840
然后周期性地回复到一大团
which periodically reverts to a mass of

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,050
未分化的原生质
undifferentiated protoplasm.

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,780
只要还能保留我的谷歌邮箱号
If I could keep my Gmail account,

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,870
我无所谓啊
I'd be okay with that.

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,510
早安啊  同志们
Hello, fellas.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,250
还记得我们之前在寻思塔伯曼教授
Remember when we were trying to figure out what that smell

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,590
办公室飘出来的是什么味道吗
coming from Professor Tupperman's office was?

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,740
-然后呢  -原来就是塔伯曼的味儿
-Yeah? - Turns out it was Tupperman.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,390
死在办公桌上都两周了
Dead at his desk for two weeks.

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,480
-天啊  -太惨了
- Oh, my God. - That's terrible.

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,040
系主任要求大家不要送花
In lieu of flowers, the department chair

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,530
改送除臭剂过去会更好哦
is asking that everyone donate a bottle of Febreze.

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,420
如果要换掉刚才的水母话题
If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish,

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,040
我可以接受改聊丰年虾
I'd be okay with brine shrimp

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,370
或者独轮脚踏车的历史
or the history of the unicycle.

26
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,780
有点同情心好吗  人家尸骨未寒呢
Show a little compassion-- a man died.

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
其实已经化成了一滩尸泥了
And turned into a puddle of goo.

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,080
我们大可以在这
Now, we can either sit around

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,590
缅怀烂成尸泥的教授
and cry over spilt professor, or...

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,760
也可以一同为一个
we can rejoice in the knowledge

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,620
空出来的终身教职庆祝一下
that a tenured position has just opened up.

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,880
我会选择后者
I choose to do the latter.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,770
拜托   终身教职制度本来就十分荒谬
Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous.

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,410
一个终身有保障的工作
A guaranteed job for life

35
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,800
只会让那些人变得过于自满  怠惰
only encourages the faculty to become complacent.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,780
如果真想要科学进步
If we really want science to advance,

37
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,290
人们应该在脑子里植入杀人晶片
people should have chips implanted in their skulls

38
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,100
只要一说蠢话  就炸烂他们的脑袋
that explode when they say something stupid.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,890
我认为人们只有在自己
Well, I believe people do their best work

40
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,140
有保障的情况下才能做到最好
when they feel safe and secure.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,110
要找我的话  只需到
If you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged

42
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,660
教职选举委员会的马屁处寻我即可
up the rectum of the tenure committee.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,960
你们几个博士都要去当马屁精吗
You Ph.D's gonna go suck up like Kripke?

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,620
才不会
No.

45
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,700
我会去申请啦
I mean, I'll apply,

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,910
但是我才不去耍手段  搞阴谋
but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.

47
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,930
我也不会
Yeah, me neither.

48
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,080
重点应该是在工作成果上
It should be about the work.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,230
而且如果我选不上
And if I can't get tenure,

50
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,230
我也希望是你或谢尔顿能选上
I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.

51
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,370
拉杰  别在莱纳德面前
Raj, don't dangle false hope

52
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,490
乱说一些给他希望的话
in front of Leonard like that.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,250
抱歉
Excuse me,

54
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,720
我跟你完全一样有资格有希望  好吗
but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,550
生活大爆炸 第六季  第二十集

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,580
-"终身教职"就是终身有保障的工作吗  -没错
- So "tenured" means a job for life? - Yup.

57
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,550
就算你做的超烂
And you can't get fired

58
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,650
他们也不会炒你吗
even if you're bad at it?

59
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,180
不太可能
Mm, not really.

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,600
听起来就跟起司工厂店里的
Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,730
正妹女服务员一样
at the Cheesecake Factory.

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,320
虽然我不太认同终身教职制度
While I disagree with the premise of tenure,

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,620
但如果他们给我这职位
if they gave it to me,

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,260
我也会继续对科学界做贡献
it wouldn't diminish my output.

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,230
我就跟太阳一样
You know, I'm like the sun.

66
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,430
发光发热  停不下来
Can't turn this off.

67
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,170
拉杰什与莱纳德也报名参选了吗
Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?

68
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,520
那他们知道自己一点机会都没有
Do they know they don't stand a chance

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,250
因为你超厉害吗
'cause you're so great?

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,600
说得好
Well put.

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,240
不得不说  虽然我总在纠结
You know, I must say I go back and forth

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,820
我们是男女朋友这件事
on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing,

73
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,460
但你崇拜我敬仰我的那些时刻
but those moments when you worship me

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,390
真的替你加分了超多
really keep you in the running.

75
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,710
终身教职的薪水会更高
It would be nice to have the increased income.

76
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,310
这样就可以不用管爸妈要钱了
Stop taking money from my parents.

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,840
花家里的钱总是会被父母管着
Money from family does come with strings attached.

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,080
何止啊
You have no idea.

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,020
他们买了辆新宝马给我当生日礼物
They buy me a new BMW for my birthday

80
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,430
但我能买座椅加热器吗
but can I get seat warmers?

81
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,110
不行
No.

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,410
"拉杰什  如果你想要屁屁热热
"Rajesh, if you want a warm butt,

83
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,740
你就得自己掏钱买"
you're gonna have to pay for it yourself."

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,870
逼急了我就真去买  死老头
Well, maybe I will, old man!

85
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,270
我觉得酒喝得差不多了
I think that's enough wine for now.

86
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,910
我一直忍不住在脑海里幻想
I just keep thinking about how cool it would be

87
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,500
打给我妈告诉她
if I called my mom and told her

88
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,710
我在加州理工得到终身教职的画面
that I got tenure at Caltech.

89
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,820
她会为你骄傲吧
She'd be proud, huh?

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
绝对会非常骄傲
Oh, very.

91
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,410
假如她接我电话的话
Assuming she takes my call.

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,850
我最大担心的是  在拿到终身教职后
My primary concern with being granted tenure

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,160
还得跟超嫉妒我的室友同住一个屋檐下
is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact.

94
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,120
我可能睡觉都得放把枪在我枕头下
I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow.

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,160
或放把电锯
Or a chainsaw.

96
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,970
也可以利用终身教职的高薪收入
Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability

97
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,260
搬离这里
and move out...

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,940
买个房子
buy a house...

99
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,480
结个小婚
get married...

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,340
组织个小家庭
start a family.

101
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,220
或者是
Yeah, or...

102
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,580
放把电锯就行
the chainsaw.

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,640
我会光荣凯旋回归新德里
And I will return to New Delhi in triumph

104
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,760
骑着宝石装饰的白象登场
atop a bejeweled white elephant!

105
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,910
而且你们知道大象的背上会有什么吗
And you know what will be on that elephant's back?

106
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,140
座椅加热器
A seat warmer.

107
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,250
不好意思  父亲  就不载你
"No, Father, you may not have a ride!"

108
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,470
我去煮点咖啡
I'm gonna make some coffee.

109
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,670
你得拍谁的马屁  才能得到这份工作
So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?

110
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,020
我不会拍任何人的马屁
I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.

111
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,120
我的工作成果足以说明一切
I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,110
那很棒
That's great.

113
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,500
这说明你很正直
That shows a lot of integrity.

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,910
谢谢
Thank you.

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,630
我就是一个天真的傻子  对吗
I'm a naive idiot, right?

116
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,130
很好  你懂我什么意思
Oh, good, you heard me.

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,830
如果你很想获得这份终身教职
You know, if you really want tenure,

118
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,300
或许你该去奉承那些有决定权的人
maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.

119
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,320
谢尔顿·库珀才不搞"奉承"
Sheldon Cooper does not do "cozy."

120
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,850
是啊是啊
You don't say.

121
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,650
但了解谁在委员会
But I suppose it wouldn't hurt

122
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,540
对我也没什么害处
to know who's on the committee.

123
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,750
我看看
Let's see...

124
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,560
珍妮·戴维斯
Oh, Janine Davis.

125
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,110
天啊
Oh, dear.

126
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,670
有问题吗
Is that a problem?

127
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,450
你也一样
Yeah, even you.

128
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,410
你是个奴隶
You're a slave.

129
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,060
我是什么来着
I'm a what?

130
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,230
我不确定  有两种可能
I'm not sure; it could go either way.

131
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,470
你好  戴维斯夫人
Hey. Mrs. Davis.

132
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,460
霍夫斯塔德博士
Dr. Hofstadter.

133
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,750
我只是想下来
Just thought I'd come down

134
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,330
为穿泳装而锻炼身材
and start getting ready for swimsuit season.

135
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,930
那很好啊
Good for you.

136
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,240
你显然不需要
Not that you need it.

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,360
我猜你穿泳装一定很迷人
I bet you look great in a swimsuit.

138
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,130
谢谢
Thank you.

139
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,060
我得了一种病  我爸称其为"家具疾病"
I've got what my father used to call "furniture disease."

140
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,280
我的胸部都下垂得要掉进我的抽屉里了
My chest is falling into my drawers.

141
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,560
我不是很熟悉这个机器
I'm not, uh, familiar with this model.

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,610
我要怎么开始
How do I make it start?

143
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,580
按"开始"
You push start.

144
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,780
好的
Right.

145
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,020
这台可能坏了
This one might be broken.

146
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,060
-你得动起来  -懂了
- You have to move. - Got it.

147
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,440
好了
There.

148
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,390
太棒了
Oh, yeah!

149
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,980
我感觉到我在运动了
Yeah, now I'm feeling it.

150
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,010
这真是来劲儿啊
Oh, this is great.

151
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,230
我愿意一辈子都做这个
I could do this for the rest of my life.

152
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,710
说到
Hey, speaking...

153
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,630
一辈子都可以做的事情
speaking of things you do for the rest of your life...

154
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,100
听说你在终身教职选举委员会  是吗
uh, did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee?

155
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,410
是的
Yep.

156
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,900
我得弄个家庭健身房了
I got to get a home gym.

157
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,640
我知道有很多
Well, I'm sure you have a lot of

158
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,390
优秀的申请者  我只是
good applicants, I just

159
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,950
想来跟你打声招呼
wanted to say hi and...

160
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,460
告诉你我会
let you know that I'll be...

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,980
-好的  我会留意你的  -好
- All right, I'll keep an eye out for that. - Yeah.

164
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,560
霍夫斯塔德
Hey, Hofstadter.

165
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,750
真有意思  这么久我还是第一次在这里
Funny seeing you here for the first time in...

166
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,090
见到你
ever.

167
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,690
走开啦
Go... away.

168
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,550
珍妮  我们一起锻炼吧
Janine the Machine, let's do this!

169
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,360
巴里
Hey, Barry.

170
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,910
快瞧瞧
Well, look at that.

171
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,950
我消耗了整整一卡路里
Burned a whole calorie.

172
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,340
你早早来这里锻炼是想消耗掉
I guess you got here early

173
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,380
那个我给你做的香焦面包的热量吧
to burn off that banana bread I baked you.

174
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,030
对啊  真的很好吃  谢谢
Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.

175
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,120
不客气  我很乐意
No, my pleasure.

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,620
如果你喜欢香蕉面包
Oh, if you... if you like banana bread...

177
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,630
我有个很棒的做法
I've got a-a great recipe.

178
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,160
秘诀在...
The trick is in... in fresh ground...

179
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,410
我发电邮告诉你好了
I'll e-mail it to you.

180
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,540
好了  我热好身了
All right, I'm warm.

181
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,850
准备好加快速度吗
Ready to kick it up a notch?

182
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,800
开始吧
Let's go.

183
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,190
我的有氧运动做够了
That's enough cardio for me.

184
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,640
在我去练举重前
I'm just... gonna stretch out

185
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,780
我先拉拉筋
before I hit the weights.

186
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,380
你没事吧
You okay?

187
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,030
快叫人来
Call someone!

188
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,890
早上好  戴维斯夫人
Good day, Mrs. Davis.

189
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,790
我是拉杰什·库萨帕里博士
This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali

190
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,240
来自天体物理学部门
from the astrophysics department.

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,420
别紧张
Don't be alarmed,

192
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,030
我不是真的在外太空
I'm not really in space.

193
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,600
总之
Anyhoo...

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,390
我想借此机会
I'd like to take this opportunity

195
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,890
向您介绍下我自己
to tell you about myself,

196
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,110
所以坐好  放松  好好看
so sit back, relax and enjoy

197
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,890
接来下这90分钟的影片
the following 90-minute video.

198
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,320
不是吧
Oh, come on.

199
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,970
我出生于新德里
Born in New Delhi,

200
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,360
是一名妇科医生的第三个儿子
the third son of an itinerant gynecologist,

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,190
我自幼聪颖  有"神童"之称
I showed early signs of genius.

202
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,580
在五岁的时候  我发现一个天体
At the age of five, I discovered a celestial object

203
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,360
后来发现原来是"月亮"
which later turned out to be the moon.

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,140
戴维斯夫人  戴维斯夫人
Mrs. Davis? Mrs. Davis?

205
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,650
戴维斯夫人
Mrs. Davis?

206
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,250
天啊  他们真是无所不在
God, they're everywhere.

207
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,640
进来吧
Come in.

208
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
库珀博士  你有何事
Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?

209
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,690
你也好  我挺好的
Yes, hello. I'm fine. Um...

210
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,170
我认为你对我的印象不怎么好
I understand you may have a bad impression of me,

211
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,120
所以我给你买了个礼物
so I bought you a gift.

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,010
库珀博士  这就多余了
Uh, Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.

213
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,910
太晚了
It's too late.

214
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,230
准备好爱上我吧
Get ready to like me.

215
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,440
《根》
Roots?
根据亚历克斯·哈利的小说《根》改编的电视迷你剧

216
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,170
讲述美国黑奴的悲惨历史
The tragic history of slavery in America.

217
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,450
可供你全家细细品味
Fun for the whole family.

218
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,710
你为何会觉得这种"礼物"会很合适
Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?

219
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,080
你是黑人  不是吗
You are black, right?

220
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,440
此次会面到此为止
This meeting has come to an end.

221
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,990
因为你想马上开始看这部剧
Because you want to start watching it right now.

222
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,810
明白明白
Copy that.

223
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,020
我看看
Let's see.

224
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,800
下一个要拜访的教职委员会委员是
Up next on the tenure committee is...

225
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,810
吴教授
Professor Wu.

226
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,570
准备好收我的"成龙全集大礼包"吧
Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.

227
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,340
先生们
Gentlemen.

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,370
-你去哪了  -医务室
- Where have you been? - Nurse's office.

229
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,070
哮喘犯了吗
Asthma attack?

230
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,900
哮喘  心脏病  反正来了一发
Asthma, heart-- some kind of attack.

231
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,710
我没事
I'm fine, though.

232
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,140
你们要去塔伯曼教授的追悼会吗
You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?

233
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,000
-不知道  -可能不会去
- I don't know. - Probably not.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,860
和他不熟
Barely knew him.

235
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,800
是啊  你们可不想让其他人发现
Yeah, you wouldn't want to look like

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,470
你们在拍教职委员会委员们的马屁
you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee,

237
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,100
他们可都会在场哦
who will all be there.

238
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,290
我正等着你们这反应呢  "丁满"姿态
Oh, yeah, that's what I was hoping for-- meerkats.

239
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,160
也就是狐獴  迪士尼电影角色

240
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,160
很不幸地告诉你  这周四的约会要泡汤了
I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so...

241
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,170
真是不好意思
bad news for you.

242
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,430
你这次的理由最好合理点
You better have a good excuse this time,

243
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,440
因为"要修整棉花棒  让掏耳朵更舒适"
because "trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right"

244
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,500
明显是胡扯
is obvious nonsense.

245
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,220
首先  你说这种话出来
First of all, when you say things like that,

246
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,100
大家会以为你是疯子
people think you're crazy.

247
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,190
第二  我取消这次约会是因为
Second, the reason I'm cancelling is because

248
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,680
我要参加塔伯曼教授的追悼会
I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.

249
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,380
听起来就很浪费时间又无趣
It sounds like a long and tedious evening.

250
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,680
的确是
Eh, it will be.

251
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,430
说实在的  要是我想度过一个漫长无趣的夜晚
Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening,

252
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,290
我宁愿选择和你约会
I'd rather it be with you on date night.

253
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,910
但我别无选择
But I have no choice.

254
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,700
教职选举委员会的人会出席
The tenure committee's going to be there.

255
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,100
这样的话  或许我也该去
Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.

256
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,210
想想看的话
Well, now that I think about it,

257
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,630
你倒是可以帮上忙
that would be most helpful.

258
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,730
当然了
Of course it would.

259
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,750
我对学术界的人际关系非常精通
I'm well-versed in academic politics,

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,360
而且作为德高望重的科学家
and as a respected scientist,

261
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,780
我可以给你加分  让你成为候选人
I can only raise your stock as a candidate.

262
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,780
我的意思是你可以当我的司机
Actually, I meant you could drive me.

263
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,270
但如果你觉得开心  刚才你说的也包括在内
But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.

264
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,830
今天有趣事发生吗
Do anything interesting today?

265
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,040
没有
Oh, not really.

266
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,650
我和艾米去逛了街
I was out shopping with Amy.

267
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,790
她让我陪她选参加追悼会要穿的衣服
She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.

268
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,230
等一下  谢尔顿会去吗
Wait-- Sheldon's going to be there?

269
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,950
我们发过誓都不去的
We all promised we weren't going to go.

270
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,340
-真是个混球  -就是啊
- Oh, what a jerk. - I know.

271
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,050
我还想自己去  不被他们发现呢
I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.

272
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,720
反正艾米要去  你想我也去吗
Well, since Amy's going, do you want me there?

273
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,820
给你加油打气
You know, to support you?

274
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,030
你真好  但参加追悼会的都会是些
That's nice, but it-it's just gonna be

275
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,820
无聊的老男人
a room full of boring old men

276
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,600
不知道你去能帮上什么忙
and I'm not sure how much help you'd be.

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,790
好吧
Okay.

278
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,450
你先想想  我系个鞋带
I'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.

279
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,780
好吧  不  谢谢
Oh, yeah. No. Thanks,

280
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,620
你会帮上大忙的
that would be great help.

281
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,780
你知道你会把有些人迷"死"的吧
You realize you might kill some of them.

282
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,230
那你们就都能获得终身教职了
Oh, then you all can get tenure.

283
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,460
别这样  老爸
Come on, Daddy.

284
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,920
其他科学家都有座椅加热器
All the other scientists have seat warmers.

285
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,660
真是丢人
This is so humiliating.

286
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,810
我必须获得终身教职
I've got to get tenure.

287
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,170
好吧  一人让一步
Okay, l-let's meet halfway.

288
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,940
那我请清洁工的次数改为两周一次如何
How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week?

289
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,010
看来我们的家要变成猪圈了
Looks like we're both going to be living like animals.

290
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,010
我们再练习一下该有的悲伤情绪
Let's go over our emotional responses one last time.

291
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,440
好的
Okay.

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,190
塔伯曼教授去世了
Professor Tupperman is dead,

293
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,480
-这让我们  -好伤心
- and that makes us...? - Sad.

294
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,830
虽然今晚来了这么多人
The fact that there are so many people

295
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,620
但我们不能不开心或不舒服
here tonight doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic.

296
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,640
而是
It makes us...?

297
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,730
好开心
Glad.

298
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,630
给戴维斯女士《根》影集的这种行为
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was...?

299
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,330
好无礼
Bad.

300
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,490
-但是  -不行
- However... - No.

301
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,870
好吧  好无礼
Fine. Bad.

302
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,540
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

303
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,270
你居然有脸
You have some nerve showing up here

304
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,110
跑这儿来找教职委员会的人闲聊
just to schmooze with the tenure committee.

305
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,780
-你不也来了吗  -拜托
- You're here. - Excuse me.

306
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,330
我是来给特百惠教授致哀的
I'm here to pay my respects to Professor... Tupperware,
特百惠是知名塑料保鲜盒公司  音似塔伯曼

307
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,170
不管他叫什么吧
or whatever his name is.

308
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,270
我也是
So am I.

309
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,340
他的离世让我  好伤心呢
His passing makes me feel... bad.

310
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,180
瞧瞧  谢尔顿
Well, well, well, Sheldon,

311
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,710
真没想到会碰到你啊
fancy meeting you here.

312
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,540
我猜格兰岱尔市的火车玩具商店
I guess the train store in Glendale

313
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,340
根本就没举办沙龙舞会
wasn't having a cotillion after all.

314
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,430
你  你也说过不来的
And you-- you said you weren't coming here, either.

315
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,030
我口音重着呢  你根本听不懂我的话
I have a thick accent. You don't know what I said.

316
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,040
我想知道为什么连佩妮也来了
I'd like to know why Penny's here.

317
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
我是来支持我家男人的  和你一样
I'm here to support my man, just like you.

318
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,480
你打算做些什么
What are you going to do?

319
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,200
记下人们要喝什么  然后端错的去吗
Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?

320
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,590
行动
Do it.

321
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,750
什么  她行动了没有啊
What? Did she do it yet?

322
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,870
她计划色诱教职选举委员会成员
She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee

323
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,620
让莱纳德有更大机会入选
to further Leonard's cause.

324
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,710
真会耍阴招
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.

325
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,080
别傻站着  赶紧把咪咪秀出来
Don't just stand there. Take your breasts out.

326
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,170
狐獴大混战
Ooh, meerkat fight!

327
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,140
你们都在浪费时间
You're all wasting your time.

328
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,880
谢尔顿最有资格获得这一职位
Sheldon is the most qualified for the job,

329
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,070
再大的反地心引力胸部
and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's

330
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,890
也不能改变这一点
going to change that.

331
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,420
说真的  你有用胶带吗
Seriously, is that tape?

332
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,000
咪咪怎么会这样坚挺呢
Like, how are they staying up like that?

333
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,910
事业线就是让别人没事业
Way to hit them with both barrels.

334
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,750
你们两个真是不知羞耻
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

335
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,580
利用女人的性感来争取自己事业的上位
Using women to advance your cause with sexuality,

336
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,780
还有不管艾米准备做什么
and whatever Amy plans on doing.

337
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,480
你是在暗示我的女朋友
Are you implying that my girlfriend

338
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,940
-没有性感可利用吗  -对
- has no sexuality to exploit? - Yes!

339
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,350
-好吧  刚暗示得不够清楚  -谢尔顿
- Okay, because that was not clear. - Sheldon!

340
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,820
怎么了  他刚才说得不够清楚
What? That was ambiguous.

341
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,000
那么现在我说清楚了
Well, now it's biguous.

342
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,720
你能怎么拿我怎么样
What are you gonna do about it?

343
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,940
你可以说些拿他老妈开涮的黄段子
You could talk some smack about his mother.

344
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,710
好主意  他会很生气的
Well, yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all.

345
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,250
昨晚
Last night,

346
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,300
我有释放性需求的感觉时
I was feeling in need of sexual release

347
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,250
恰好想到你的母亲
when I happened to come across your mother.

348
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,230
好了
Okay, okay.

349
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,930
各位  我们这是做什么呢
Guys, what are we doing here?

350
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,990
我不知道你在做什么
I don't know what you're doing,

351
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,030
我是准备暗示
but I was about to insinuate

352
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,670
我和拉杰的妈发生了关系  让她赚了一块钱
that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.

353
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,990
你想干嘛随便你
Oh, you do what you want,

354
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,360
我可不想因为终身职位而失去朋友
but I don't want to lose my friends over tenure.

355
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,760
朋友是一辈子的
Friends are forever.

356
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,270
-终身职位也是  -快走
- So is tenure. - Walk!

357
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,390
我打算回家
I'm just gonna go home

358
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,270
让我工作成果说明一切
and let my work speak for itself.

359
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,580
你说的对  我也不屑于这样做[在我身下]
You're right. This is beneath me.

360
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,190
和你老妈昨晚一样
Like your mother was last night.

361
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,500
你怎么说  谢尔顿
How about it, Sheldon?

362
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,240
你觉得我应该怎么做
What do you think I should do?

363
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,340
你的学术成就永远是卓越的
Well, you'll always be an academic success,

364
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,890
但是
but...

365
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,080
我真心怀疑
I seriously question

366
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,540
你还能不能交上更多其他的朋友
whether you'll make any more friends.

367
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,080
我不要更多  不过走吧
I don't want any more, but let's go.

368
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,930
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

369
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,940
我巴不得为你照看孩子
I would "wove" to baby-sit for you.

370
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,790
我可不能这样麻烦你
I could not ask you to do that.

371
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,340
说什么呢  孩子们可"耐"我了
Nonsense. Children "Wove" Me.

372
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,920
我有某种妙招能让他们笑哇笑哇
Something about me just makes them "waugh" and "waugh."

373
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
不  我们可不能输给那个混蛋
No. We cannot lose to that jerk.

374
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,660
我不管了
Yeah, screw it.

375
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,620
我要进去
I'm going in.

376
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,260
你给我等等
You... Wait. Hold on.

377
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,660
我确定"我不管了  我要进去"
I believe "screw it, I'm going in" is what

378
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,040
正是我昨晚对你妈说的话
I said to your mother last night.

379
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,360
别担心  我不是真的说了
Don't worry, I didn't really say that.

380
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,800
我觉得性行为
I-I find the concept

381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,650
荒唐而且令人不愉快
of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.

382
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,170
应该在我还有机会的时候秀下咪咪的
Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.

383
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,060
戴维斯夫人
Mrs. Davis?

384
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,630
戴维斯夫人
Mrs. Davis?

385
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,530
戴维斯夫人
Mrs. Davis?

386
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,060
我知道你在里面
I know you're in there.

387
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,310
我在停车场看到了你的车了
I saw your car in the parking lot.

388
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,450
什么事
What?

389
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,280
我刚得知你推荐我
I just found out that you recommended myself,

390
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,620
霍夫斯塔德博士与库萨帕里博士
Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali

391
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,630
进入了终身职位最终候选人名单
to be on the short list for tenure.

392
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,480
尽管你们怪里怪气
Well, despite your quirks,

393
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,490
但你们三个在各自工作领域里的成就
the three of you are very accomplished

394
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,530
是毋庸质疑的
in your respective fields.

395
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,570
我不知道你说"怪里怪气"是什么意思  但是
I don't know what you mean by "quirks," But, um...

396
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,840
我想表达我的谢意
...I do want to express my gratitude.

397
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,470
你不会又带礼物来吧
You didn't bring another gift, did you?

398
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,760
没有
No, no.

399
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,000
我已经学到教训了
No, I learned my lesson.

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,140
我知道那是不礼貌的
I understand that was inappropriate.

401
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,160
很好
Good.

402
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,620
总之  谢谢你
Anyway, thank you.

403
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,750
不客气
You're welcome.

404
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,510
我就当这事没发生吧
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

405
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,230
好极了  大妹子
Yeah, right on, sister.
