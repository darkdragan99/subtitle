1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,190
马吃掉后的象
Knight to queen's bishop-five.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,110
高招  莱纳德要如何应对
Oh, very nice. what's leonard going to do this?

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,060
是舍弃卒  还是改换布局呢
Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,960
马上揭晓
Let's find out.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,050
莱纳德  准备好了吗
Leonard, ready?

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,350
-好了  -开始
- Ready.  - Go.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,880
该死  滑了一下
Damn it. I slipped.

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,030
真可惜
Too bad.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,280
但你清楚激光障碍特工象棋的规则
you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,930
莱纳德又死了  谢尔顿  你上吧
Leonard died again, sheldon. you're up.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,120
虽然我深爱象棋  激光和空气消毒剂
Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant,

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,300
但我必须放弃
I must forfeit.

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,800
为什么
Why?

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,180
-因为快到11点了  -那又怎样
- Because it's almost 11:00. - so?

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,710
佩妮给我立了"11点前敲门就往喉咙揍一拳"规则
So, penny has a "don't knock or I punch you in the throat" rule.

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,760
这个主意好不好
Hey, you know what'd be a great idea?

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,870
我们找些女生来玩激光视觉脱衣象棋
We get some girls over here and play laser optical strip chess.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,510
相信我  霍华德  肯玩象棋的女生
Believe me, howard, any girl who would be willing to play that,

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,940
你不会想看她们的裸体
You don't want to see naked.

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,060
你太低估我了
You underestimate me.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. penny.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,540
佩妮
Penny.

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,500
好啊  谢尔顿
Hey, sheldon.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,850
上午11点到了
It's 11:00 a.m.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,260
我知道  你安全了
I know. you're safe.

26
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,300
包裹送到时  你在上班
This package came while you were at work

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,240
太好了  我订的莱茵石  谢谢
oh, great, my rhinestones.Thank you.

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,360
-等等  -怎么了
- Excuse me. - what?

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,520
你要签收
You have to sign this.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,590
这是什么
What is it?

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,190
我签收了包裹
When I signed for the package,

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,630
我就代表邮递公司
I was deputized by the united parcel service

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,270
并受委托最终送达
And entrusted with its final delivery.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
我现在要你确认收到包裹
I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,540
我才算完整履行法律义务
So that i'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,490
谢尔顿  只不过是一盒莱茵石而已
Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,950
这跟物品无关
Well, the contents are irrelevant.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,620
法定委托关系已经形成
A legal bailment has been created.

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
你一点都不重视吗
Is that mean nothing to you?

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,830
没有人会重视这个
It means nothing to anybody.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,310
过来  给你看看我做的东西
Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.

42
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,890
‘委托’在普通法里的解释是
"bailment" describes a relationship in common law

43
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,050
当个人的私有财产
where a physical possession of personal property,

44
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,130
或者说动产
or "chattels,"

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,210
从委托人一方转移到
is transferred from one person, the bailor,

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,880
受托人一方
To another person, the bailee...

47
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,710
对对对  快看
Yeah, yeah, yeah. look, look, look!

48
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,170
我做起了一门生意
I started a business.

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,430
显然不是干净的生意
Obviously, not a cleaning business.

50
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,180
不是  我在做花花发夹  看
No, I'm making flower barrettes. see?

51
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,880
我起了个名字叫佩妮花花
I call them penny blossoms.

52
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,030
我给自己做了一个
I made one for myself,

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,070
接着店里的女生也想要
then all the girls at work wanted one.

54
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,560
然后我拿给在旧城镇开店的老板娘看
Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town.

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,650
她卖一些卡和自制首饰
She sells cards and homemade jewels,

56
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,770
她说想卖呢  我答应了
She said she wanted to sell them. I said, "okay."

57
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,720
一周里我赚了156美刀
And in one week,i made a $156.

58
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,700
真好  签收吧
Good for you, Sign here.

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,670
谢尔顿  你没听懂吗
Sheldon, don't you get it?

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,920
如果生意做下去
If this takes off,

61
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,070
我就不用当服务员了
I won't have to be a waitss anymore.

62
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,750
那周二晚上谁给我带干酪汉堡
But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights?

63
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,460
其他服务员呗
Another waitress.

64
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,620
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

65
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,760
我怎么知道
I don't know.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,890
那你还放心让她负责我的食物
And you're going to let her handle my food?

67
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,640
南希  她叫南希
Nancy. her name is nancy.

68
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,710
你瞎编的名字吧
I think you're just making that up.

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,950
谢尔顿  抱歉不能给你带牛肉汉堡了
Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay?

70
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,240
我不想一辈子就做个服务员
I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
干酪汉堡  我要的是干酪汉堡
Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

72
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,980
行  干酪汉堡
Fine, cheeseburger.

73
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,300
说不定让南希负责更好
Maybe I'd be better off with nancy.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,390
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,160
这门生意能做  对吧
I mean, this could be a business, right?

76
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,240
你一天能做几个
How many of these can you make a day?

77
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,710
大概20个
About 20.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,840
每个...佩妮花花能赚多少
And how much profit do you make per...Penny blossom?

79
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,540
不知道  50美分吧  不确定
I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.

80
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,910
你当然确定不了  好吧
Of course you're not. all right...

81
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,470
1天10美刀乘以1周5天
Ten dollars a day times five days a week

82
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,190
乘以1年52周等于2600美刀
Times 52 weeks a year is $2,600.

83
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,200
就这么多
That's all?

84
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,300
只是税前
Before taxes.

85
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,930
我又不用为这些交税
I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,760
我相信国税局会强烈反对
I believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree.

87
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,880
但是  如果你利用现代营销技巧
But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques,

88
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,050
优化生产过程
And you optimized your manufacturing process,

89
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,410
或者能做好这门生意
You might be able to make this a viable business.

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,210
你知道怎么做吗
And you know about that stuff?

91
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,630
佩妮
Penny...

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,200
我可是物理学家
I'm a physicist.

拥有整个宇宙

95
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,940
电台司令[乐队名]是谁
Who's radiohead?

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:33,040
囧囧囧囧囧

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,370
我有宇宙重要事物的相关知识
I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,530
祝你好运
Good luck.

99
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,720
谢尔顿  等等
Sheldon, hold on.

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,140
你能教我怎样才能赚多点钱吗
Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this.

101
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,110
我当然有能力教你
Of course I could

102
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,100
谢尔顿  等等
Sheldon, wait!

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,420
你会教我吗
Will you?

104
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,460
首先声明  你要我协助你
Just to be clear here, you're asking for my assistance.

105
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,790
是的
Yes.

106
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,840
你要明白  这牵扯到给你解释怎么做
And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?

107
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,190
我明白
I understand.

108
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,960
而你不准对我明嘲暗讽
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so.

109
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,530
好吧
Okay.

110
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,970
很好
Good.

111
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,570
我们的首要前提是
Let's begin with the premise that

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,060
你之前所做的全都不对
Everything you've done up to this point is wrong.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,880
哇哦  我也猜到了
Oh, Imagine that.

114
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,000
-讽刺我  拜拜  -不是  对不起  回来
Sarcasm. good-bye. No, sorry, wait. Please come back.

115
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,310
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第18集

116
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,330
完工
There. done.

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,470

All right.

118
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,880

12 minutes and 17 seconds. oh!

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,980
还不错吧?
Pretty good, right?

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,140
计算佩妮花花一小时的产量
Penny ossoms per hour.

121
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,210
再算上批量购买的材料费用
Based on your wholesale selling price,

122
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,270
你一天实际上只能赚...
You'll effectively be paying yourself...

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,210
5.19美元
$5.19 a day.

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
一天?
"a day"?

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,010
连印度尼西亚的球鞋场童工都赚得比你多
There are children in a sneaker factory in indonia who outearn you.

126
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,870
这不可能
That just can't be right.

127
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,590
-你质疑我的数学能力?  -不  抱歉
You're questioning my math? no, sorry.

128
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,940
想见识下我的数学大作吗?
Want me to show my work?

129
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,090
天啊  千万别
Oh, god, no.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,250
告诉我该怎么做就好
Just please tell me what to do about it.

131
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,060
好吧
All right.

132
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,170
你知道奥诺雷·布兰在1778年开发的
Are you familiar with the development

133
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,050
可互换零件吗 ?
in 1778 used interchangeable parts?

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,990
好吧  就是生产流水线
The assembly line, of course.

135
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,440
听着  既然我不讥讽你
Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide,

136
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,220
你也不准显摆
You're not allowed to be condescending.

137
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,980
原始协议内不包含这条
Sthat wasn't a part of our original agreement,

138
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,190
所以我不同意
And I don't agree to it now.

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,080
好吧  算了
L right, fine.

140
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,210
我们怎么在公寓里架机器和传送带?
How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,610
你那是指流动生产线
You're thinking of the moving assembly line,

142
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,240
可以理解  但依然错得不可原谅
An understandable but not excusable mistake. no.

143
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,550
流动生产线是在1908年由亨利·福特发明的
The moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in 1908.

144
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,390
这项创新通过低成本的生产商品
That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer

145
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,490
造就了现代消费文化
Culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods.

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,060
你说的那个电台司令肯定不知道这个东西吧
I guess that isn' one of the topics discussed on your radiohead.

147
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,550
来吧  可别错过好戏
Let's go. we're going to miss the coming attractions.

148
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,460
怎么了?
What's the matter?

149
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,850
我在吃掉最后一个卒时扭伤了我的蛋蛋
I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.

150
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,460
请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
* Give me some timeon ato blow the man down *

151
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,920
我是香港的深海水兵  初来乍到
* I'm a deepwatesailor just come fromong Kong *

152
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,080
让开让开  我来把他放倒
* Give me way, hey, blow the man down *

153
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,400
给我些威士忌
* If you give me some whiskey *

154
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,020
听我把歌儿为你唱
* I'll sing you a song *

155
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,370
请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
* Give me some time to blow the man down. *

156
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,190
喂
Hello?

157
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,730
-好啊  -好啊
Hello. Hello.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,630
船尾甲板上的同胞
* Come quickly lay aft

159
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,010
离开岗哨  快快来吧
* To the break of the poop *

160
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,070
帮我把他放倒!
* To me way, hey, blow the man down *

161
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,160
不然我会用靴子将你踢倒
* Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot *

162
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,430
请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
* Give me some me to blow the man down.

163
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,750
等下  怎么回事?
W-W-Wait, what's going on?

164
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,560
你是指水手之歌吗?
I assume you're referring to the sea chanty.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,850
这是一首很有节奏的工作歌
It's a rhythmic work song

166
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,330
能够提高产量
designedo increase productivity.

167
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,200
没错  虽然很疯狂  但的确很有效
Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works.

168
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,280
看吧  我们不用3分钟
Look, we made is Penny Blossom

169
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,660
就完成了一个佩妮花花
in under three minutes.

170
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,790
很赞  但似乎我更加一头雾水了
Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.

171
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,030
佩妮在做头饰
Penny's making hair accessories.

172
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,510
我的工作是最优化生产过程
I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process.

173
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,480
好了  休息时间结束
Alright, break's over.

174
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,370
听好命令  你们全体为一...
* Pay attention to orders now you one and all... *

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,680
等等  你用的什么黏合剂?
Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?

176
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,830
热熔胶
Hot glue.

177
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,480
不会吧
You're kidding.

178
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,050
任何快干胶都比它好
Any of the cnoacrylates would do a better job.

179
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,780
不管用  这花容易渗水
It won't work, the flower'too porous.

180
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
我们把矽胶原液注进底层
What if we infused the bottom layer

181
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,690
这样就有了一个更牢固的底座
with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?

182
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,390
好主意
Intriguing.

183
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,630
问得好
Good question.

184
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,570
你有什么市场营销渠道吗?
Wh are your marketing and distribution channels?

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,110
呃  和我一起工作的女招待
Well, ere are the waitresses at my work,

186
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,480
在旧城镇里有一间小巧可爱的商店...
and this cute, little shop in Old Town...

187
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,270
停停停  没有什么实体店存在
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush-- virtually non-existent.

188
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,410
我在考虑  我们首先为她
I'm thinking that we set her up

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,660
建立一个电子商务监控系统
with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.

190
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,410
还要什么中介系统呢
Why not eliminate the middle man?

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,750
我们可以装一个小服务器群
We could install a small server farm

192
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,400
IP地址直接是她卧室!
with a static IP in her bedroom.

193
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,430
那她就需要一些工业制冷系统了
She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.

194
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,090
当然了  不过慢着
Of course, but before we set up

195
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,870
我们建立市场营销基础设施之前
a marketing andistribution infrastructure,

196
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,250
必须先完善生产过程
we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process.

197
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,500
首先  现在有个严重问题
To start with, she has a terrible problem

198
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,330
闪粉因为受潮而凝固成块了
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

199
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,630
是啊  真是难伺候
Yeah, it's a bitch.

200
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,200
这我以前见过
Uh, I've seen this before.

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,210
在哪儿?
Where?

202
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,800
脱衣舞娘常遇到的问题
It's a common stripper problem.

203
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,880
她们一跳舞  一流汗  就凝固了嘛
They dance, they swe, they clump.

204
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,060
你是不是在考虑
Are you thinking about adding

205
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
加点硫酸钙进去用作干燥剂呢?
a desiccant ke calcium sulfate?

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,000
其实  我在想一个叫薇迦的脱衣舞娘
Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega.

207
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,450
当然啦  可以用硫酸钙
But re, calcium sulfate could work.

208
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
让我们再想想别的
Let's think out the box for a moment.

209
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,590
用分子筛怎么样
How about a molecular sieve?

210
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,530
我厨房里有个意面筛子
I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.

211
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,760
我们可以从化学实验室
Hey, we could liberate some

212
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,420
拿些微孔活性炭出来
micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.

213
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,860
很好  拉杰  你和霍华德去拿活性炭
Oh, great.Raj, why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal?

214
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,800
莱纳德  你去给网站做个初步设计
Leonard, why don't you start working on preliminary web site designs.

215
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,850
我去我们公寓里腾些地方出来
I'll make some space in our apartment

216
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,670
这样我们可以展开生产过程
so we can move the manufacturing process.

217
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,370
我的公寓哪里不好了?
Well, what's wrong with my apartment?

218
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,140
这里不是我的公寓
It's not my apartment.

219
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,650
等等  我该干什么
Wait, wait, what am I going to do?

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,450
呃  这是你的生意
Uh, hey, it's your business.

221
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,480
做你想做的任何事
Do whatever you want

222
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,820
好  真不错
Okay, cool.

223
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,540
我要睡一觉
I'm gonna take a nap.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,720
我还在修改中
I'm still twinking things a little bit,

225
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,160
但能给你们看网站的大致样子了
but this will give you the general idea of the Web site.

226
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,230
你们觉得怎么样
So, what do you guys think?

227
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,420
呃  不管我用何种方式说出来
Uh, pretty much any way I say that

228
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,910
都会伤到他的感情的
is going to hurt his feelings.

229
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,270
有什么问题吗
Okay, what's wrong with it?

230
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,390
有什么问题
What's wrong with it?

231
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,670
不是你  我没在问你
Not you. I wasn't asking you.

232
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,490
佩妮
Penny?

233
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,450
呃  有一点点幼稚
Uh, well, it's a little juvenile.

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,230
看着像一个13岁女孩的
I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page

235
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,470
个人主页
of a 13-year-old girl.

236
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,160
不像啊
No, it doesn't.

237
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,950
拜托  约会热线都可以拿这个来吸引色狼了
Please. <i>Dateline</i> could use it to attract predators.

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,120
佩妮  这是你的公司
Penny, this is your enterprise,

239
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,580
所以最终决议权在于你
so it's ultimately your decision,

240
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
但基于他工作的质量
but based on the quality of his work,

241
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,290
我强烈建议开除莱纳德
I'd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.

242
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,100
你想开除我?
You want to fire me?

243
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,120
我怎么想都没有关系 这是佩妮的决定
What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny's decision.

244
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
佩妮?
Penny?

245
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,540
等等  既然我做得那么糟
Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job,

246
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,220
那为什么已经有人下订单了
then why do we already have orders?

247
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,970
真的吗
We do?

248
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,280
看
Uh-huh. Look.

249
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,440
阿拉巴马亨斯维尔的菲奥娜·冯戴尔太太要两个
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.

250
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,660
没开玩笑吧  两个?
No kidding. Two? Uh-huh

251
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,740
看那些评论
Look at the comments.

252
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,390
谢谢  佩妮花花  这些为我遮羞再好不过了
Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect, to cover my bald spot."

253
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,110
真感动
that is so sweet.

254
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,120
当作遮羞的用途
Camouflaging bald spots.

255
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,810
这能够吸引男士目光
That's primarily a male concern.

256
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,530
也许我们可以扩大市场
Perhaps could expand our market.

257
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,480
花花发卡怎么能吸引男人呢
How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?

258
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,280
我们加上蓝牙!
We add Bluetooth!

259
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,790
太聪明了  男人喜欢蓝牙
Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

260
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,070
等等  等等
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

261
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,270
你想做一个装有蓝牙的发卡?
you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?

262
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,690
佩妮  任何东西加上了蓝牙都会好很多
Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.

263
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,250
噢  天啊
Holy crap.

264
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,940
有人刚订了一千个佩妮花花
Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.

265
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,960
怎么可能
Get out!

266
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,220
谁会需要一千个带莱茵石的
Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes

267
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,670
花花发卡
with rhinestones?

268
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,720
第五届新泽西州东卢瑟福德
"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey,

269
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,590

Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."

270
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,850
噢  又一个可以开拓的市场
Oh, another market to expand

271
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,300
裸体基佬
To balding gay men.

272
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,780
我打赌女同们喜欢蓝牙
And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

273
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,080
我们该开始工作了
We should get to work.

274
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,050
等等  为什么他要一天内加急交货
Wait, wait, why does it say "one-day rush"?

275
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,100
我们什么时候提供加急服务了
Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

276
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,070
亚马逊购书网提供加急服务的
Amazon offers one-day rush.

277
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,010
但他们又不需要把书黏在一起
Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together.

278
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,360
我们怎么才能在一天内
How the hell are we going to make

279
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,220
做出一千个佩妮花花呢
a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?

280
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,470
别对我吼啊
Don't yell at me.

281
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,570
我又不是负责生产的  我只负责网页设计
I'm not manufacturing. I'm just Web design.

282
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,740
好吧  我要去打电话取消订单
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to call and cancel the order.

283
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,780
什么
Excuse me,

284
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
这难道不正是你的目标吗
but was this not your goal?

285
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,260
通过企业的独特性
Financial independence

286
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,480
和创新性来达到经济独立的目的
through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

287
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,470
是我的独特性和创新性  但仍是你的目标
My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.

288
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,190
我只是不知道我们怎么才能完成这活
I just don't see how we can pull this off.

289
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,510
就是这种支吾的语气和自我怀疑
That, right there, that equivotion and self-doubt,

290
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,840
这可不是美国精神
that is not the American spirit.

291
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,910
戴维·克罗基特[拓荒时代英雄]放弃阿拉莫了吗
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?

292
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,540
吉姆·鲍伊[美国英雄人物]放弃了吗
Did Jim Bowie?

293
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,090
他们是没放弃  他们被宰了
They didn't quit.They were massacred...

294
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,110
被无数愤怒的墨西哥人宰了
by like a gazillion angry Mexicans.

295
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,590
这么说吧
Let me put it this way.

296
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,990
你这单的毛收入
Your gross receipts on this one order

297
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,620
将会超过3000美金  只要工作一晚
will be over $3,000 for one night's work.

298
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,390
大家开工
You guys get started.

299
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

300
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,740
上网买鞋子
Going online to buy shoes!

301
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,260
她来了以后会来山里转转  来转转
* She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes * * When she comes

302
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,910
她来了以后会来山里转转  来转转

305
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
她来了以后会来山里转转
* She'll be coming round the mountain... *

306
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,730
如果我想周六晚上干这个
You know, if I wand to spend my Saturday nights doing this,

307
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,380
我大可留在印度
I could have stayed in India.

308
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,620
别来你那套第三世界的假把戏
Oh, stop with the fake third world crap.

309
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,180
你父亲是妇产科医生
Your father's a gynecologist.

310
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,650
你有一大帮仆人
And you had a use full of servants.

311
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,560
我们才四个仆人
We only had four servants.

312
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,090
还有两个是小孩
And two of them were children.

313

Wait, hold.Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?

318
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,620
我想我听到工厂那边有牢骚
I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factor floor.

319
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,830

320

佩妮  劳动力是必须
Penny, the labor force is a living organism

321

被精心呵护的生命体

322
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,270
任何影响生产力的抱怨
Any counterproductive grumbling must be skillfully

323
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,200
必须用管理手段扼杀  看着

324

谢尔顿

334
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,740
因为我向矿工商店出卖了灵魂

拜托  如果你不能醒着
Come on, but if you don't stay awake

338
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,940
我们无法按时完工的

339
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,610
抱歉  咖啡绝对不行
I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question.

340
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,890
当我搬到加州时

我向我妈保证我不会嗑药的

I have complete faith that you will make them.Good night.

345

346
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,340
谢尔顿  没有你的见解和领导
But, Sheldon,without your insight and leadership

347
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,980
整个公司都会垮掉
this entire enterprise will surely fail.

348
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,310
你说得太对了
You're right, of course.

349
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,520

很好
Very well,

351
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,710
但如果这让我麻醉或致幻

352
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,160
你要给我妈有个交代
You're going to have to answer to my mother.

353
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,150
看看 普朗克常数
Look at Planck's Constant.

354
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,500
不能有一点偏差
It could not be less arbitrary.

355
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,780
如变了一点  我们熟知的生活就不存在了  嘭!
If it varied slightly, life as we know would not exist.Bang!

356
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,960
现在  再看一下整个推论过程
Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument,

357
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,400
把熵反向  因果颠倒
but with entropy reversed and effect peceding cause.

358
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,170
这时的宇宙
So you are thinking a universe

359
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,000
不是从中心点膨胀
that's not expanding from the center--

360
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,430
是在从一个可能的空间中缩退  嘭!
no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bang!

361
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
在这个世界里  我们实际上都是
This is a space where we are all essentially Alice

362
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,280
镜子里的爱丽丝
through the looking glass,

363
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,690
站在红发女王前
standing in front of the Red Queen,

364
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,500
口渴了  只有饼干来解渴  嘭!
and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bang!

365
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,430
当然  在另一个叫元期宇宙的空间里
Of course, in another universe, let's call it universe prime,

366
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,430
有另一个谢尔顿
there's another Sheldon

367
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,160
-我们该让他上床睡觉的  -嘭!
We should let him go to bed. Bang!

368
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,720
不敢相信我们做到了
I can't believe we actually did it.

369
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,180
一千个该死的佩妮花花

373
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,990
那是你所有的利润
That's your entire profit margin.

374
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,060
噢  那算了
Oh.Then never mind.

375
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,900
我来打印邮寄标签
I'll print out the shipping label.

376
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,690
怎么了
What?

377
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,660
有封来自新泽西的东卢瑟福的

They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.

380
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,360

一天内加急

382
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,950
我真该把那个从网上删掉
I really need to take that off the Web site.

383
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,090
这样的话  我们要马上开工了
Okay, well, guess we'd better get started.

384
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,050
不是说真的吧
You can't be serious.

385
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,220

Come on.

386
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,370
工作间的生命体

还有阿拉莫的吉米·克罗基特

戴维·克罗基特

吉米·克罗基特是只蟋蟀

391
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,140
行了  行了  我知道  好了吧

I'm tired-- I've had like 18 cups of coffee.

393

The point is, if we just pull together, we can do this.

394

佩妮  也许你不相信
