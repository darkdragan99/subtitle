1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,450
问题看上去无解啊
The problem appears to be unsolvable.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,550
我们可以用电脑模拟计算
Maybe we could run some computer simulations.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,190
变量太多  运行时间会很长
There are too many variables. It would take forever.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,720
我们肯定漏掉了什么
We've got to be missing something.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,320
重来一遍
Let's start again.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,020
电影这里是七点二十上映  这里是七点四十
The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40,

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,620
这里是八点十分  这里八点四十五
here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,030
这几个电影院得排除在外
These theaters have to be eliminated.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,480
为什么  那里有最先进的数码影像技术
Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,570
20道环绕立体声
20-channel surround sound.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,170
没错  可是那里没有刨冰机
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,570
还完全不理睬我那么多封投诉信 错上加错
Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, i might add.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,400
这个影城怎么样 座椅舒适极了
What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,570
它们只有Twizzlers没有Red Vines  [糖果品牌]
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines.

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,570
无论多好的腰椎支撑都是无法弥补的
No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,850
至少要一个小时吃饭
Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat,

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,700
在谢尔顿认证的电影院周边
and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,570
根本没有谢尔顿认证的餐厅
proximate to a Sheldon-approved theater.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,490
我们可以看完电影再吃晚饭
We could eat after the movie.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,080
不予通过
Unacceptable.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
吃饭太晚会造成
The delay would result

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,580
明天早晨的大肠蠕动出现在工作时间
in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,580
等下  这里有个7-11便利店
Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,580
我们可以偷偷把Slurpees[7-11出的冷饮]带进去  就当刨冰了
We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees,

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
藏大衣底下就行了
in under our coats,

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,650
这样我们就可以从容地先在这里  这里  或者这里吃饭了
after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,300
咱们刚才怎么就没想到呢
Wow. I don't see how we missed that.

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,310
不好意思  Slurpees哪里算得上刨冰呢
Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,080
所以我们刚才没想到
That's how we missed it.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,580
谢尔顿  在此紧要关头  虽说没有先例吧
Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis,

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,880
您能不能临时认同一下Slurpees等于刨冰
to create an emergency ad hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,580
莱纳德  你明白我做不到的
Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,580
好吧  我看我们只有一个选择了
Okay, I guess we only have one option.

34
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,830
是啊  别无它法
Yep, I don't see any way around it.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,210
-再见  谢尔顿  -拜拜了 -好好看家
-Bye, Sheldon. -See ya. -Stay loose.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,450
他们没有错  这是唯一的选择
They're right, it was the only option.

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,420
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第14集

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,030
[手拿Red Vines的糖糖]

39
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
快关门  快关门
Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,190
-咋了  -关就是了
- Why? - Just do it!

41
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,360
先进来再关门
Get inside and shut the door

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,890
你又没有说清楚
Well, you didn't specify.

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,260
莱纳德在么
Is Leonard around?

44
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,160
他去看电影了不带我
He went to the movies without me.

45
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,890
这是唯一的选择
It was the only option.

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,030
不好意思  我不知道这是哪种社交情况啊
I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is.

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,560
您能给我点指引么
Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,290
楼管就在楼下呢
The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs,

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,030
我还没有缴房租
and I haven't paid my rent.

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,430
明白了
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,430
佩妮  让我藏匿洛城房产商的逃犯
Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a fugitive

52
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,090
我有点怕怕
from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,490
没什么大不了的  就是欠了点房租而已
It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
因为餐厅缩减了我的工作时间
because they cut back my hours at the restaurant

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,130
我的车又坏了
and my car broke down.

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,760
你还记得么  几个月以前 我告诉过你引擎检修灯在闪
If you recall, I pointed out the "check engine" light to you several months ago.

57
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,890
引擎检修灯还好着呢 现在还闪呢
The "check engine" light is fine. It's still blinking away.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,590
是那个可恶的引擎罢工了
It's the stupid engine that stopped working.

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,560
修车花了我将近 一千二百刀
It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

60
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,190
依我看  你的所有问题
You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,930
都可以通过多挣点钱来解决
by obtaining more money.

62
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,290
是啊  我看也是
Yes, it occurs to me, too.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
等我一下
Hang on a moment.

64
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,460
来吧  拿一些
Here. Take some.

65
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,990
等你有钱了再还我
Pay me back when you can.

66
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,260
你这儿有很多钱啊
Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

67
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,890
所以我才派蛇守卫
That's why it's guarded by snakes.

68
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,260
拿一些吧
Take some.

69
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,260
别傻了
Don't be silly.

70
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,360
我从来都不傻
I'm never silly.

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,490
拿着
Here.

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,790
我不能要
No, I can't.

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,260
你不是需要钱么
Don't you need money?

74
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,360
-是啊  可是  -我用不到这些钱
- Well, yeah, but... - This is money I'm not using.

75
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,690
你要用钱怎么办
But what if you need it?

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,590
我的日常开支占我税后收入的46.9%
My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income.

77
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,530
其余的部分分别藏在银行帐户里
The rest is divvied up between a small savings account,

78
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,030
这个隐蔽的花生糖的罐子里
this deceptive container of peanut brittle

79
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,460
还有超级英雄人偶的空心屁屁里
and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure

80
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,930
他不得已才隐姓埋名得以终日
who shall remain nameless for his own protection.

81
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,160
或者是女她
Or her own protection.

82
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,460
拿一些吧
Take some.

83
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,390
真的么  你肯定么
Really? I mean, are you sure?

84
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,730
我最近没有什么大的开销
I see no large upcoming expenditures

85
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,360
除非他们发明了新的科技
unless they develop an affordable technology

86
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,560
能将我的骨骼铸成金刚狼一样的合金
to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,360
他们在研究这个么
Are they working on that?

88
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,760
我衷心希望
I sincerely hope so.

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,930
好吧
Okay.

90
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,990
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,390
不行  谢尔顿  亲爱的
Oh, no, I can't. Sheldon honey,

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,030
我不希望你我之间 变得怪怪的
I don't want things to be weird between us.

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,730
如果我每天早晨上班之前 都要和你问早安
Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work

94
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,460
可是你却住在冰箱盒子里 用雨水洗头  不是也很奇怪么
and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?

95
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,860
等我有钱了就还你
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

96
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,290
那是肯定的
Of course you will.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,090
没钱你也还不了
It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can.

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,460
我假设你遵循前因后果
Assuming you subscribe

99
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,690
与时间的线性关系
to a linear understanding of time and causality.

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,560
我已经开始后悔了
I'm regretting this already.

101
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,690
我反复考虑过了
You know, I've given the matter some thought,

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,360
我宁可自己是一只家养宠物
and I think I'd be willing to be a house pet

103
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,990
也不愿意成为高智能的外星人
to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,890
有意思
Interesting.

105
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,030
问我为什么
Ask me why.

106
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,730
一定要问么
Do I have to?

107
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,990
当然
Of course.

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,090
这样对话才能进展下去
That's how you move a conversation forward.

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,860
为什么呢
Why?

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,060
这样学习的机会 会比较充裕
The learning opportunities would be abundant.

111
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,360
并且  我喜欢被人抓抓肚皮
Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.

112
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,790
佩妮  上班还好么
Hey, Penny. How was work?

113
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,190
妙极了
Great.

114
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,030
我希望我能
I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory

115
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,060
做一辈子奶酪店的服务员
for my whole life.

116
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,590
这是讽刺么?
Was that sarcasm?

117
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,390
不
No.

118
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,760
那这句呢?
Was that sarcasm?

119
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,890
是
Yes.

120
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,160
-那这句  -闭嘴吧
Was that sar-- Stop it!

121
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,460
佩妮  这有个你的包裹
Penny, you appear to have a package here.

122
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,530
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

123
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,090
肯定是我订的贝雷帽
This must be the beret I ordered.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,430
都是几个月前的事了  是以前订的
A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.

125
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,690
你知道么  贝雷帽
Did you know the beret is an example

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,130
是女性时尚参考男性军服
of a piece of women's fashion

127
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,190
很好的例子
adapted from male military uniforms?

128
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,590
另一个迷人的例子是肩饰
Another fascinating example is the epaulet.

129
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,890
他没说谎
He's not lying.

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,830
他真的很喜欢肩饰
He does find that fascinating.

131
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,930
无所谓了
Okay, whatever.

132
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,130
我并没有为了一个贝雷帽
It's not like I'm running up and down the streets

133
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,160
在街上逛来逛去
just buying myself berets.

134
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,630
我订了一个  一个月前
I bought one, like, a month ago,

135
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,930
那是之前订的
and it was back-ordered.

136
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,190
-现在终于寄到了  有问题么？  -没有
Look, it finally arrived, all right? All right.

137
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,290
我的天  你能不能别那么多事
Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?!

138
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,630
真奇怪
Weird.

139
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,030
太好了  原来这不是正常的对话模式
Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction.

140
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,160
我本来还不确定
I wasn't sure.

141
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,130
你们之前吵过架?
Did you guys have an argument?

142
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,330
没啊
No.

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,960
你肯定干什么事惹着她来着
Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.

144
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,760
我没概念了
I'm at a loss.

145
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,090
高兴地话  你可以去查查我的社交日志
If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions

146
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,530
看看有没有我没注意到的失误
and see if there's a blunder I overlooked.

147
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,430
你的这份
Here you go.

148
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,690
对  你还多欠我两块
Oh, you owe me another two dollars.

149
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
木须肉涨价了
The price of moo shu pork went up.

150
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,190
当个"可恶的犹太人"真是越来越难了
It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.

151
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,760
佩妮  你的龙虾酱炒虾
Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.

152
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,060
谢谢  莱纳德  我该给多少
Thank you, Leonard. What's my share?

153
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,190
没事  我请你
Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

154
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,830
不  多少钱?
No, really, how much?

155
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,260
差不多10块11块吧
It's... whatever. $10, $11.

156
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,160
到底是10块还是11块?
Well, which is it, $10 or $11?

157
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,330
14块5  真没多少
$14.50. But it's no biggie.

158
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,890
下次你请就好了
You'll get the next one.

159
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,930
又怎么了
What?

160
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,190
他在猜如果
He was just wondering if he wore

161
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,860
他穿紧身上衣和牛仔裤的话
skintight jeans and a tank top

162
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,060
是不是也能免费吃到鲜虾捞面了
if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.

163
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,430
你什么意思
What are you saying?

164
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,860
我用我的身体来让别人请客?
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

165
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,430
我是骗中餐小姐
That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?

166
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,860
对  拉杰  你什么意思
Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

167
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,060
告诉你吧  哥们
'Cause let me tell you something, buddy.

168
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,630
我靠自己的钱过活  明白?
I pay my own way in this world, okay?

169
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,890
我不需要靠别人
I don't rely on anybody!

170
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,190
这又怎么了?
What was that about?

171
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,230
当他感受到压力的时候就尿急
He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out.

172
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,960
像小狗似的
Kind of like a puppy.

173
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,230
莱纳德  拿着  10, 11, 12... 14块
Here, Leonard-- $10, $11, $12... $14.

174
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,430
是14块5  算了
It was $14.50, but it's okay.

175
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,090
太好了  饭(双关:正餐)来了
Oh, good. Dinner's here.

176
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,690
没错  正餐来了
Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some.

177
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,030
而我只能吃外卖
I'm having takeout food.

178
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,730
-好吧  -说得太他妈对了
Okay. You're damn right it's okay.

179
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,590
我在饭店吃了四天的残羹剩饭
I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days,

180
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,130
今天我想换个花样  去告我啊
and I wanted something different. So sue me.

181
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,830
请原谅  佩妮
Forgive me, Penny, but that would be

182
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,890
那是诉讼挑唆的意思
the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

183
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
谢尔顿  我有了钱马上还你
Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can.

184
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,960
只是要宽限我几天
You just have to give me more time.

185
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,390
等等  你借她钱来着
Oh, wait, you lent her money?

186
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,430
她需要钱
She needed money.

187
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,530
你看上去很有压力
You seem under pressure.

188
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,990
我借给你的够么
Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?

189
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,490
你可以再来点
Because I can give you more.

190
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,860
你很喜欢这样不是么
Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you?

191
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,430
打开你的小蛇把守的罐子
Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can

192
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,830
然后把钱施舍给那些付不了帐单的姑娘
and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.

193
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,930
你去哪
Where are you going?

194
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,190
回家 在那我不用像个犯人似的被审问
Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal.

195
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,760
我忘了幸运饼干了
I forgot my fortune cookie.

196
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,360
以防你们谁有贼心
In case either of you have larceny in your heart,

197
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,660
提醒一下  我已经把钱从小蛇罐子挪走了
you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.

198
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,090
但如果真缺钱的话
But if you're ever short,

199
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,690
在绿灯侠的屁股里总能找到50块
there's always a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

200
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,640
温馨的烛光哈
A little mood lighting, huh?

201
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,940
因为没付帐单
When I didn't pay my bill,

202
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,370
水电局认为
the Department of Water and Power thought

203
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,040
我会享受这样的气氛
I would enjoy the ambience.

204
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,640
这样看来他们还挺周到的
Yeah, they're very considerate that way.

205
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,770
我用谢尔顿的钱付了房租
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.

206
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,970
然后只剩14块
Then I had like $14 left over.

207
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,410
14块?
$14, huh?

208
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,910
放回你的口袋里
Put it back in your pocket,

209
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,270
要不然我会找个其他的地方搁
or I'll find some other place to put it.

210
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,910
已经放回去了
Back in the pocket it goes.

211
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,250
要知道  谢尔顿真不在乎 什么时候你还他钱
Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back.

212
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,370
事实上 正是像这种为数不多的特点
It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to,

213
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,640
才让你对他没有杀意
you know, kill him.

214
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,210
但这并不是最大的问题所在
Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.

215
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,040
你不就欠了点费吗
So you're a little behind on your bills.

216
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,640
谁不欠费啊
Everybody gets behind on their bills.

217
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,970
我知道  但这和我的预期差别太大了
Yeah, I know, it's just... this wasn't the plan.

218
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,970
我没打算变成现在这样的
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,370
那你原来打算怎么样
Well, what was the plan?

220
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,870
当六个月服务员然后成为电影明星
Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.

221
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,170
有没有B计划?
Was there a plan B?

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
电视明星
TV star.

223
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,440
可能没你想的那么糟
It's probably not as bad as you think.

224
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,470
让我们看看
Let's take a look.

225
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,410
说不定能找到些能缩减的开支
Maybe we can find some corners to cut.

226
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,240
这有一些
Oh, here's something.

227
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,670
如果你家没有电
If you don't have electricity,

228
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,770
那你可能也不需要有线网络了
then you probably don't need cable.

229
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,610
只是说说而已
Just a suggestion.

230
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,170
价值170美金的表演课程?
$170 dollars for acting classes?

231
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,610
不  我不能放弃我的表演课
Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes.

232
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,740
我是个专业女演员
I'm a professional actress.

233
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,540
你有能赚钱的表演工作?
You've had an acting job where you got paid?

234
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,870
这不是评判"专业"的标准
That is not the definition of professional.

235
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,970
实际上这就是...我们还是继续看吧
Actually, it kind of... Let's keep looking.

236
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,740
哪儿来的洛杉矶高等法院的1800美金罚款?
Whoa, what's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?

237
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,710
没什么
Oh, that's nothing.

238
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,110
没什么?
Nothing?

239
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,840
貌似你以4000英里的时速
It sounds like you got caught speeding

240
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,210
超速驾驶被逮着了
going 4,000 miles an hour.

241
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,810
还记得科特吗
Well, remember Kurt?

242
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,910
你那个前男友?
Your ex-boyfriend?

243
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,410
嗯
Yeah.

244
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,540
他在警车上小便被抓了
He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.

245
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,770
-什么?  -他喝醉了
-What? -He was drunk.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,610
但愿如此
I would hope so.

247
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,470
话说他有很多罚款单
Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets

248
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,510
还有一堆告票
and a bench warrant,

249
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,070
所以  我帮他付了罚款
so I, you know, I paid his fines.

250
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,310
他把钱还给你了吗
Did he pay you back?

251
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,540
没有  不过他会还的
No, but he will.

252
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,340
这还建立在他是个天生没信用 经常喝醉
And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people

253
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,940
还在警车里小便的人渣的基础之上的?
who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?

254
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,410
莱纳德  我不会打电话给科特向他讨债的
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.

255
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,640
那...
Well...

256
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,310
你准备怎么做?
what are you gonna do?

257
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,510
我也不知道
I don't know,

258
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,640
不过我可能得去找个便宜点的地方住了
but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.

259
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,410
不...
Oh, no...

260
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,110
你不会想这样做的
Oh, you don't want to do that.

261
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,310
为什么不呢?
Why not?

262
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,070
搬家要花很多钱的
Moving is a big deal.

263
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,540
你得去超市买那些置物箱
You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes,

264
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,110
那些箱子不干净的话  你的书就会有股甜瓜味
and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons,

265
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,270
就像...
and it's just, like...

266
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,410
你干吗不找个室友搬进来住呢
Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here

267
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
你认识什么适合的人不
do you know anybody

268
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,840
我肯定那个跟谢尔顿一起住的人
Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon

269
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,440
决不会介意搬来跟你住的
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

270
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,870
莱纳德  亲爱的  如果我们开始一起住的话
Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together,

271
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,010
我会一直都缠着你的
I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.

272
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,440
真的吗
Really?

273
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,870
你以为我表演课是白上的吗
And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.

274
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,470
那些木须肉在我的十二指肠里烧穿了个洞
This moo shu pork's burning a hole through my duodenum.

275
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,040
利未记(圣经)第十一章第三节里说
Leviticus 11:3:

276
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,370
"凡蹄分两瓣  倒嚼的走兽
"Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud

277
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,840
你们都可以吃"
among the beasts shall ye eat."

278
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,540
你每次吃汉堡王的天椒皇堡的时候
Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time

279
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,710
我有拿印度圣歌来取笑你吗
you scarf down a Whopper?

280
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,170
你们在干嘛
Hey, what's going on?

281
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,310
我们在玩火之谷冒险游戏 目标是拿到至尊王冠
We're on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.

282
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,970
你想要火之谷吗 这里就有
You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here.

283
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,140
你们想不想玩真人冒险游戏?
Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?

284
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,710
出去玩?  我刚弄了杯可可
Outside? I just made cocoa.

285
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,210
来吧  会很好玩的
Come on. It'll be fun.

286
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,110
到底是什么游戏?
What is it?

287
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,210
你们还记得 佩妮的前男友科特吗
Do you guys remember penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

288
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,340
对  就是他
Yeah, that's him.

289
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,210
原来他欠了佩妮很多钱 我想去问他讨回来
It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him.

290
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,440
谁想参加
Who's with me?

291
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,670
两个六
Ooh, double sixes.

292
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,340
你们真的忍心让我一个人去吗
Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?

293
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,910
太棒了  我得到了一把剑
Oh, cool, I got a sword.

294
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,840
我可能需要点帮助
I could use some help.

295
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,740
给你
Here.

296
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,770
真难以置信
You guys are unbelievable.

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,770
你们玩游戏就是为了模拟冒险场景
You play a game to simulate adventure,

298
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,310
但真的可以出去冒险的时候 你们就都窝囊了
but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.

299
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,510
莱纳德  还记得我们上次去找这个男人
Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman,

300
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,270
结果回来的时候裤子都没了吗
we returned home without pants?

301
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,210
我记得
I do.

302
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,210
你确定么  但你提议表明你已经忘记了
Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don't.

303
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,710
我不怕他
I'm not afraid of him.

304
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,910
好吧  莱纳德刚才清楚地表明了他的问题
All right. Leonard fairly calls the question:

305
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,540
谁愿意放弃我们的游戏而去面对
Who is in favor of abandoning our game and confronting

306
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,410
佩妮那个类固醇激素旺盛的前男友
Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

307
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,240
并以一种自杀的方式去向他要钱
in a suicidal mission to extract money from him?

308
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,310
代我们向科特问好
Say hi to Kurt for us.

309
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,110
你们说  佛罗多离开夏尔 把魔戒带去莫都的时候
Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor,

310
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,110
山姆怀斯  皮平和梅利有没有陪他一起去?
didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?

311
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,610
-他们去了  -所以
-They did. -Well?

312
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,270
他们那时很艰难  莱纳德
They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

313
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,610
再说  没有人剥了他们的裤子
Plus, no one stole their pants.

314
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,710
好吧  好好享受你们的游戏
Fine. Enjoy your little game.

315
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,970
我自己去完成这个冒险
I'll make this quest on my own.

316
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,870
莱纳德  等等
Leonard, wait.

317
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,910
带件外套去
Take a jacket.

318
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,610
外面有点凉飕飕的
It's <i>shpritzing</i> a little.

319
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,310
你们都是损友
You guys suck.

320
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,410
去吧  求你们了  他太健壮了
Come on, please? He's so big.

321
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,870
大家都清楚我们的计划了
Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?

322
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,970
嗯  库萨帕里准备要尿裤子了
Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself,

323
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,110
我准备要吐了  谢尔顿准备逃跑了
I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away,

324
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,240
你准备要死了
and you're going to die.

325
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,770
我们对一下表吧
Shall we synchronize our watches?

326
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,440
伙计们  我们有四个人 他只有一个人
Guys, there are four of us and one of him.

327
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,510
也就是说他将有更多的战利品
Which means his triumph will be even larger.

328
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,140
吟游诗人会为他写歌
Minstrels will write songs about him.

329
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,240
这样吧
Okay, how about this?

330
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,540
我来跟他谈
I'll do the talking.

331
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,410
你们就站在我后面假装很凶悍
You just stand behind me and try to look formidable.

332
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,370
出门前应该上个厕所的
I should've peed before we left.

333
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,340
什么事
Yeah?

334
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,870
你好  科特
Hi, Kurt.

335
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,210
你是莱尼吗
Lenny, right?

336
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,640
其实我不喜欢被叫莱尼  不过没关系
I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay.

337
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,970
你还记得
Um, you remember

338
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,870
谢尔顿  霍华德 和拉杰吗
Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

339
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,170
不记得  你想干嘛
No. What do you want?

340
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,540
他不记得我了
He don't remember me?

341
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,910
他怎能不记得我了
How could he not remember me?

342
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,810
谢尔顿  别这样
Sheldon, not now.

343
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,210
我可记得他
I remember him.

344
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,940
事情是这样的  佩妮的经济出现了状况
Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial jam,

345
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,570
而你欠她的钱  对于缓解危机
and the money that you owe her would go a long way

346
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,740
相当有帮助
to solving her problems.

347
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,570
于是她叫你来拿钱
And she sent you to get it from me?

348
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,370
当然不  她是不好意思来取
No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money.

349
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,240
此外  我认为欠债还钱  天经地义
I, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt.

350
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,940
你认为
You do?

351
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,870
说"认为"  语气已经较强烈了
"Feel" is a kind of a... it's a strong word.

352
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,840
我希望对你来说  这词儿还算是礼貌用语
Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.

353
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,510
我想什么时候还就什么时候还
She'll get it when she gets it.

354
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,170
你看  问题解决了
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

355
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,770
目的达到了
A successful quest.

356
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,870
我们快去找个有干净厕所的加油站吧
Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.

357
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,470
不  问题还没解决
No, the problem isn't solved.

358
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,740
他根本没理会我们
He just blew us off.

359
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,810
我明白了
I've got it.

360
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,140
因为上次见面时  我正穿着万圣节服饰
He didn't remember me because the last time we met,

361
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,640
所以他没记得我
I was in a Halloween costume.

362
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,740
拜托  莱纳德  我们走吧
Come on, Leonard, let's go.

363
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,170
不  你们想走就走吧
No. You can leave if you want to.

364
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,310
我必须有始有终
I'm gonna see this through.

365
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,210
那好吧
Okay.

366
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,470
其实本来就不该带你们来
I guess, technically, that was my fault.

367
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,470
拿不到佩妮的钱  我是不会走的
I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.

368
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,310
你的后援团去哪了
What happened to your backup?

369
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,270
我可不需要后援团
I don't need backup.

370
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,570
因为正义站在我这边
I have right on my side.

371
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,140
而且我长裤里还多穿了条平脚裤
And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.

372
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,510
恭喜你
congratulations.

373
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,710
你没有拿到现金
You may not have succeeded in getting cash,

374
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,040
却打到了正式的欠条
but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

375
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,840
或许我们应该把你头拿去公证一下
Maybe we should have your head notarized.

376
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,950
不介意的话  我还是想尿尿
If anybody cares, I still have to pee

377
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,840
-谢尔顿在吗  -在的  等等
-Hey. Is Sheldon here? -Yeah. Hang on.

378
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,140
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

379
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,840
帽子不错
Nice hat.

380
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,240
最近流行这款
It's kind of a fashionable look these days.

381
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,370
看起来像捕鱼的
Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

382
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,870
佩妮  你来啦
Hello, Penny.

383
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,270
谢尔顿  这是你的钱
Sheldon, here is your money.

384
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,370
非常感谢  帮了大忙了
Thank you very much. It helped a lot.

385
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,040
讽刺吗
Sarcasm?

386
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,370
不
No.

387
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,010
该死  我还是没有摸透其中奥秘
Darn. I can't seem to get the hang of that.

388
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,540
虽然这与我无关
Hey, I know it's none of my business,

389
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,370
但这些钱你从哪来的
but where did the money come from?

390
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
就如你说的  我省下一部分开支
Well, I cut back my expenses like you said

391
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,010
在餐厅里多加几小时的班
and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant,

392
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,710
但最主要的是  突然间
but the biggest thing was, out of the blue,

393
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,740
科特回来了
Kurt shows up

394
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,610
还把他欠我的钱还给了我
and gives me the money he owes me..

395
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,470
真的吗  他有说为什么吗
Really? Did he say why?

396
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,240
是的  他说他觉得很惭愧
Yes, he said he was feeling guilty

397
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,740
还钱本是天经地义
and wanted to do what was right.

398
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,610
就这样
That's it?

399
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,840
他没有对其突然良心发现 给出任何理由吗
Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

400
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,540
没有  我认为他真的改变了
Nope. I just think he's really changed.

401
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,140
我们明晚要共进晚餐
We're having dinner tomorrow night,

402
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,140
有机会戴新买的贝雷帽了
and I get to wear my new beret.

403
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,610
再见
Bye, guys.

404
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,570
拜拜
Bye.

405
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,340
为你骄傲  莱纳德
Well done, Leonard.

406
