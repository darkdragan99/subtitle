1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,100
好险
That was close,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,980
我太喜欢清晨彩弹的味道了
God,I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,500
还是很搞笑  拉杰
Yeah,still finny,Raj.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,640
没办法去山脊了
There's no way we can get to the ridge.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,890
化学部的人完全把我们堵死了
The chemistry department has us completely cut off.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,400
河床呢
But what about the creek bed?

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,500
被药理学部门拿下了
The pharmacology department controls that,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,230
他们全都吃了兴奋剂
And they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,360
完了  我们死定了
That's it then. we're doomed.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,690
现在该承认我们会沦落至此
I think the time has come to acknowledge that

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,170
就是因为某人没参加
we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,500
我的物理学部门战略会议
Physics department paintball strategy meeting.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,730
我说了  我妈妈得了微血管扩张
I told you my mom has spider veins.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,730
我要带她去激光治疗
I had to take her to the laser clinic.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,930
我也跟你说了  我要看医嘱
And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,700
我们要定个策略
We need a plan.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,460
-"上帝之锤"怎么样  -我忘了
How about operation hammer of the gods? I forget.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,630
哪个是"上帝之锤"
Which one is hammer of the gods?

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,580
我们藏到停车场的垃圾桶后面
We hide behind the dumpsters in the parking

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,560
伏击去尿尿的人
Lot and ambush people when they come to pee.

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,300
不行
No go.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,660
垃圾桶那边完全是天文学部门的领地
The dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory.

23
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,860
应该不成问题
That shouldn't be a problem.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,360
金星白天都显现
Venus is up during the day.

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,460
他们估计都在望天呢
They're probably just all staring at the sky.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,230
行了  我们现在要战术性撤退
All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat.

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,100
你们看了那集《星际之门》吗
Did you see the episode of stargate

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,710
他们在一个
where they found themselves on a planet

29
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,720
类似雅典和斯巴达文明的星球上
with a culture based loosely on earth's athens and sparta?

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,600
算了
Not important.

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,530
莱纳德  拉杰和我一起冲出大门逃跑
Leonard, raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away.

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,760
霍华德掩护
Howard will cover us.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,360
为什么不是我逃跑你掩护
Why don't I run away and you cover me?

34
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,000
因为你用胜利来换取带你母亲看病
Because you chose your mother's veins over victory.

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,300
数到三
On three.

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,630
一  二  三  闪
One, two, three, go!

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,430
我必须带她去
I had to take her!

38
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,700
都快到穿泳衣的天气了
It's almost bathing suit weather!

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,960
我投降  别开枪
I surrender! don't shoot!

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,960
他们从那边走了
They went that way!

41
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,130
霍华德  我是你的队友
Howard, I'm on your team.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,930
莱斯利  谢天谢地
Oh, leslie, thank god.

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,660
你们小队的其他人呢
Where's the rest of your squad?

44
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,530
他们把我留下来等死
Ah, they left me here to die.

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,060
你的呢
What about yours?

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,400
都死了
Dead, all of them.

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
真遗憾
Sorry.

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,460
没必要
Don't be.

49
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,760
都是友军误伤
It was friendly fire.

50
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,660
他们就是不听话
They just wouldn't listen.

51
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,830
我们被包围了
Well, we're surrounded,

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,400
只能等着被俘虏
So I guess there's nothing for us to do

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
或者被干掉了
but wait to be captured or killed.

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,760
最难受的是等待
Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.

55
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,350
知道有颗带有你的名字的子弹
All the while knowing that there's a

56
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,500
始终会在那里等着你
Paint pellet out there with your name on it.

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,700
大大的死亡湿球
Yeah, the big wet ball of death.

58
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,730
更能让你感觉自己还活着  对吧
Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,230
确实
It kind of does.

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,330
还是别浪费时间吧
I say we make every moment count.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,430
可以
I agree.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,560
有什么可做的呢
How exactly do we do that?

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
霍华德  你怎么不掩护我们
Howard, why aren't you covering us?!

64
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,200
我们快被杀光了
We're getting slaughtered out here!

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,530
战场就是地狱
War is hell.

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第16集

67
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,500
你们早上看了新的预算备忘了吗
Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,470
又减少了
Yeah, more cutbacks.

69
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,080
太无法接受了
Unacceptable.

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,820
我就想不明白  他们干嘛不直接放弃你们
It baffles me why they don't simply let some of

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,000
就有更多钱给我做试验了
You go so that there's money available for my research.

72
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,670
你知道我烦恼什么吗  谢尔顿
You know what baffles me, sheldon?

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,470
就你的成绩来看  我看是任何事
Based on your academic record, any number of things, I imagine.

74
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,070
-伙计们  -莱斯利
Hey, guys. hey, leslie. hey.

75
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,570
霍华德  我帮你拿到高速原型机的批准了
Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,740
太好了  莱斯利  谢谢
That's great, leslie. thanks.

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,870
互帮互助而已啦
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

78
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,040
那是什么意思
What was all that about?

79
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,140
没什么
Oh, uh, no big deal.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,070
他们让莱斯利管一些自由经费
They gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.

81
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,140
那挠背和"喵"又是怎么回事
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back- scratching and the meow!

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,210
我觉得挠背的隐喻
I believe the back-scratching metaphor

83
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,970
通常指投桃报李的情况
Generally describes a quid pro quo situation where

84
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,310
一方提供物品或服务给另一方
One party provides goods or services to the

85
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,970
报答一种类似之举
Second party in compensation for a similar action.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,070
谢谢
Thank you.

87
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,070
至于"喵"  我感觉听起来像非洲的麝猫
The meow, that sounded to me like an african civet cat.

88
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,500
说完了吗
Are you done?

89
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,700
没有
No.

90
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,940
尽管名字里有猫  但其实麝猫不是真的猫
Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat.

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,870
说完了
Now I'm done.

92
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,400
知道我怎么想吗
You know what I'm thinking?

93
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,100
我觉得霍华德并不是用挠背做隐喻
I'm thinking howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor.

94
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,570
我觉得确有挠背一说呢
I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.

95
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,540
是吗  霍华德
What about it, howard?

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,030
我不想说是因为
I didn't want to say anything 'cause I

97
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,540
我知道你和莱斯利以前好过
Know you and leslie have a little history.

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,850
我不在乎
I don't care about that.

99
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,050
太好了  我其实早就想说了
Great, 'cause I've been dying to say something?

100
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,180
在彩弹小屋里!  两次!
In the paintball shed! twice!

101
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,030
这就是为什么你没有掩护我们撤退
Is that why you didn't cover our Escape

102
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,550
还让我们像牲口般被屠宰?
and let us get cut down like animals?

103
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,180
对此我非常抱歉
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

104
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,590
阵前脱逃
Dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is

105
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,810
是要被送交军事法庭的
a court-martial offense.

106
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,930
管他什么军事法庭[德语]
Court-martial, schmort-martial,

107
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,850
莱斯利·温克尔是第五个和我做过爱的女生
Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.

108
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,550
我是说  不包括付费的
I mean, for free.

109
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,910
而且你还拿到了高速原型机
And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

110
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,680
老兄 那玩意可不便宜
That's an expensive piece of equipment, dude.

111
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,380
我们剩下的人的预算就被啃到见骨了
And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.

112
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,430
你可以这样看这个问题
Okay, one way to look at this is that I'm getting new equipment,

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,710
我有了新设备  你们没有  这不公平
And you're not, and that's unfair.

114
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,960
更好的角度是 我有女人而你们没有
But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not,

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,380
还有什么比这更好
And that's delightful.

116
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,350
所有东西都不响应了
The whole thing froze.

117
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,510
不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happened.

118
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,850
冷静点  能解决的
Calm down. we'll figure it out.

119
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,180
我怎么能冷静得了?
How can I calm down?

120
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,780
我的整个购物车都要被清空了
I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart.

121
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,580
我选了三个小时的鞋就这么一扫而空了
That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.

122
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,910
嗨  佩妮
Hello, penny.

123
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,680
嗨  谢尔顿
Hello, sheldon.

124
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,810
你坐在我的专座上了
You're in my spot.

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,050
你准备坐这么
Are you planning on sitting here?

126
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,310
不  我要去漫画店
No, I'm going to the comic book store.

127
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,850
那我坐哪有什么区别?
Then what difference does it make?

128
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,050
有什么区别?
What difference does it make?

129
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,450
好戏登场
Here we go.

130
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,880
那是我的专座
That is my spot.

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,210
在这个不断变化的世界里  这是不变的一点
In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency.

132
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,360
假设我的生命用一个建立在
If my life were expressed as a function

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,920
四维直角坐标系中的方程来表示的话
on a four-dimensional cartesian Coordinate system,

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,140
这个座位从我坐上那一刻开始 就成为了 (0,0,0,0)
That spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

135
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,040
你说啥?
What?

136
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,280
不要坐他的专座
Don't sit in his spot.

137
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,140
好吧
Fine.

138
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,990
满意了?
Happy?

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
我没有不满意
I'm not unhappy.

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,010
我爱他 不过他也太极品怪胎了
Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.

141
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,340
好了  电脑修好了
Okay, that should do it.

142
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,180
太感谢了  真是我的恩人
Oh, thank you. you are a lifesaver.

143
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,280
你订了可真不少
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

144
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,010
可悲的是其实这些对我来说真的不算多了
Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not.

145
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,280
这就是你们的彩弹枪?
Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,180
没错  你下次应该和我们一起来
Yeah. you ought to come out with us sometime.

147
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,910
谢谢  不过还是算了  我从内布拉斯加来
Oh, no, thanks. I'm from nebraska.

148
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,780
在那里  当我们对什么东西开枪的时候 要么是我们要吃它们
When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them

149
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,610
要么是让他们别妨碍我和男友办事
or make them leave our boyfriends alone.

150
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,340
孩子  你心跳在狂飙 我果然魅力无边啊
Boy, your heart's racing. I must've really gotten you going.

151
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:41,310
一半是你的原因   一半是我先天就心律紊乱
Well, it's partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

152
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,280
真性感
Sexy.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,040
那么我可以假定你的感受是
Can I assume that you likewise found the experience...

154
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,910
你满足了我
Satisfactory?

155
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,810
这不是我原本打算的措辞  不过当然
That wasn't quite the word I was looking for, but sure,

156
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,910
我知道我合格了
I'll do this pass-fail.

157
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,180
你觉得我给你弄的那个原型机如何啊
Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,340
很赞啊
Oh, it's great.

159
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,710
工程院里的每个人 都羡慕得要命
Everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out.

160
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,840
你很幸运使得旁人痛苦万分的感觉很好吧
Isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?

161
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,310
一般人理解不了
You know, most people don't get that.

162
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
霍华德  我回来了
Howard, I'm home!

163
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,380
好极了
Oh, great.

164
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
读书俱乐部的活动取消了
Book club was cancelled!

165
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,640
叶太太颈椎又出问题了
That thing on phyll's neck opened up again!

166
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,710
我忙着呢  老妈
I'm busy, ma!

167
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
忙到不能帮妈妈把拉链解开啊
Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?!

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,410
您别进来
Don't come in, ma!

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
为什么
Why not?

170
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,810
他有客人在
He's got company!

171
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,340
又开始心律紊乱了
Oh, there's the arrhythmia.

172
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,880
她是犹太人嘛
Is she jewish?!

173
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,780
你是犹太人么
Are you jewish?

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,710
-不是  -是的
- No. - yes!

175
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,310
那行  你们好好玩
Okay, then you kids have fun!

176
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,840
别忘了防护措施
Use protection!

177
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,140
你觉得他会注意到吗
You think he'll notice?

178
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,440
有这种可能
There's a chance.

179
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,080
那我们怎么办
Oh, what are we gonna do?

180
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,540
"我们?"
"we"?

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,840
你错了  曾经有一个我们的机会摆在你面前
No, no, you had your chance to be "we"

182
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,840
就在一年半以前
For, like, a year and a half now.

183
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,300
现在  你是你  你完蛋了
Right now, you are "you," and you are screwed.

184
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,840
我们为什么要告诉他是我干的
Why do we have to tell him I did it?

185
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,280
因为我们不会告诉他是我干的
Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.

186
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,880
这样行么
Okay, okay, how about this?

187
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,780
我们告诉他有人闯进来
We tell him somebody broke in.

188
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,040
就为了向沙发上射击彩蛋
Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?

189
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,210
不好意思  我就会相信
I'm sorry, I buy it.

190
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,080
现在嗑药的那么多
All those people are on drugs.

191
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,540
我们可以告诉他
We could tell him

192
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,940
他们想要这个沙发别打扰和男友办事
they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,610
好吧
Okay, fine.

194
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,440
我们把它翻过来不就行了?
What if we just flip it over?

195
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,280
不错吧
There. looks fine, right?

196
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,940
坐印
Mm, butt print.

197
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,840
没有明显的坐印
There's no discernible butt print.

198
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,280
拜托
Oh, come on.

199
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,810
好了  坐印
There, butt print.

200
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,380
太小  太...
It's too small and too...

201
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,410
漂亮了
Perfect.

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,810
谢谢
Thank you.

203

他真是个好朋友

知道有朋友的最大好处是什么吗

214

他们不会无来由地说个不停
They don't talk incessaly for no particular reason.

215
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,740
不  不  朋友之间会宽容小错误的
No, no, friends forgive the little things.

216
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,580
我得回去洗头了
You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.

217
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,780
你敢  小姐

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,640
我也说不上
I'm not sure.

224
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,780
就是感觉不对
It doesn't feel right.

225
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,380
不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

226
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,480
那个  佩妮干的

抱歉
Excuse me.

228
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
你怎么不坐在办公椅那吃
Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?

229
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,080
我怎么不坐在办公椅那吃?
Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

230

开始了
Here we go.

231
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,180
那是我的办公椅
That is my desk chair.

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,340
是我工作的地方
That is where I work.

233
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,210
我不在办公椅那吃饭  也不在专座上工作
I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot.

234
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,610
我在办公椅那工作  在专座上吃饭
I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.

235
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,910
非常怪胎
Wackadoodle.

236

有个简单的解决办法
You know, there's kind of an obvious solution here.

237
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,440
起来
Get up.

238
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,140
好了  问题解决
There. problem solved.

239
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,180
没人关心你要坐在哪
Nobody cares where you're going to sit.

240
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
你又不疯
You're not crazy.

241
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,140
抱歉  但问题并没解决
Excuse me, but the problem is not solved.

242
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,760
如你的脑袋不小心被截掉了

安个狗的脑袋在上面
And we transplanted a dog's head in its place,

244
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,410
这叫"问题解决"吗
Would that be "problem solved"?

245
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,610
如是你的脑袋  问题就解决了
If it were your head, it would be.

246
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,080
谢尔顿  我很  很抱歉  但就一周
Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week.

247

你就不能通融点
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

248
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,540
好了  抱歉  我没细想
Yeah, sorry. I didn't really think that through.

249
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,850
你声称说一周就好
You claimed it's going to be a week,

250
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,340
但我对你选的干洗店没信心
But I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

251
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,510
为什么没有
Why not?

252
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,240
你注意到他柜台上的标志了吗
Did you notice the sign on his counter?

253
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,080
他不是全职干干洗的
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

254
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,480
他还配钥匙
He also makes keys.

255
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
看到老天的份上  谢尔顿
Oh, for god's sake, Sheldon.

256
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,040
专注是很重要的
Focus is important.

257
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,140
迈克尔·德倍基[心脏手术创始人]做心脏移植手术之余
Was Michael Debakey a wedding planner

258

他右手在召唤他吗
His right hand is calling him?

不  是莱斯利·温克尔
No, it's Leslie Winkle.

266
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,010
有一段时间了
It's a long story.

267
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,440
我十分钟后接你
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

268

各位  再见[法语]

我以为今晚我们要玩《光环》
I thought we were going to play halo tonight.

270
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,380
要我怎么做  莱纳德
What am I supposed to do, Leonard?

271
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,440
有女人在那饥渴地想和我做爱
There's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me.

272

273
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,110
不  一点都不
No. not at all.

274
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
不管怎样  我得走了
Nevertheless, I must depart.

275
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,540
对了  我说过吗
By the way, did I tell you?

276

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,580
观测欧洲原子核研究委员会的超级对撞机
Research trip to geneva to check out the cern supercollider.

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,810
真不公平
That's not fair.

279
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,010
你甚至不是物理学家
You're not even a physicist.

280
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,040
好了  有两个角度看到这个问题
Okay, there are two ways of looking at this...

281
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,980
出去
Get out.

282
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,010
拜
Bye.

283
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,680
你有提高
You're improving.

284
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,680
谢谢
Thank you.

285
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,740
真人实战确实有助于提高
It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.

286
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,240
听着
Hey, listen.

287
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,980
周六我姐结婚
Saturday my sister's getting married.

288
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,110
我想你陪我去
I-i want you to come with me.

289
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,140
要求宾客穿半正式礼服的
It's black tie.

290
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,980
天  我真的不想去
Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

291
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,180
为什么不
Why not?

292
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
我去婚礼时  一般都骗骗搞搞胖伴娘
When I go to weddings, it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

293
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,580
有约的人了  我不知该怎么做
I don't know what I would do with a date.

294
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,010
好的  我理解
Oh, all right. I understand.

295
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,480
谢了
Thanks.

296
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,040
对了  你去不了日内瓦那件事我真抱歉
Hey, I'm really sorry about that geneva trip.

297
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,280
你说什么呐
What about it?

298
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,580
你不知道吗
Oh, didn't you hear?

299
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,540
我得减少去的人数
I had to reduce the number of people going

300
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,440
然后你就被刷下来了
and you didn't make the cut.

301
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,410
什么时候
When did that happen?

302
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,210
大约12秒之前
About 12 seconds ago.

303
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
等等
Well, hold on.

304
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,580
你是说 我要是不去那婚礼就不能去日内瓦了
Are you saying if I don't go to the wedding, I can't go to geneva?

305
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,380
我真不想这么说出来
Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

306
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,240
抱歉但是这让我感到有点不舒服
Okay, I'm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.

307
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,680
怎么
How so?

308
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
这样看起来好像你在
Because it's like you're controlling

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,710
用研究旅行和新设备来控制我
Me with new equipment and research trips.

310
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,580
如果我不这样控制你的话
Well, if I weren't controlling you with

311
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,710
我会不舒服
new equipment and research trips, Then I'd be uncomfortable.

312
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,780
为什么
How so?

313
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,520
这样就会弄得像
'cause then we'd be in, like,

314
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,780
我们是来真的一样
A real relationship with feelings and all that crap.

315
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,080
那说到底  我不就是一个你买来玩的性爱玩具嘛
So, bottom line, I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

316
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,280
不不  也不全是
No. no, not at all.

317
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,510
你也算是个尤物了
You're also arm candy.

318
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,180
怎么样
So?

319
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,980
你怎么看
What do you think?

320
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,510
妈我要借一套礼服
Hey, ma, you got to rent me a tux!

321
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,680
现在就要?
Right now?

322
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,040
你做什么爱还要用正装的
What kind of sex are you having up there?

323
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,080
你干嘛蹲在那里
Why are you crouching there?

324
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,110
这是我的专座
This is my spot.

325
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,180
我还能蹲哪里
Where else am I supposed to crouch?

326
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
我不知道  你老家?
I don't know. texas?

327
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,740
又来了
Here you go.

328
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,310
刚刚从干洗店里拿来的  像新的一样
Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.

329
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,310
真的吗  太好了
Really? great.

330
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,210
谢尔顿  看  焕然一新
Sheldon, look. good as new.

331
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,640
从那个配钥匙店   我严重怀疑
From that key maker, I highly doubt it.

332
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,780
拜托  谢尔顿
Come on, sheldon.

333
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,280
试了再说
Just give it a try.

334
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,940
好吧
All right.

335
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,780
好了  舒舒服服的 (0,0,0)
There, nice and comfy cozy. zero, zero, zero.

336
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,510
还有一个零
There's one more zero.

337
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,740
你忘掉了时间坐标
You forgot the time parameter.

338
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,440
给我坐下
Sit on the damn couch.

339
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,810
不行
Nope.

340
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,960
什么意思  不行 这有什么问题啊
What do you mean, "nope"? What's wrong with it?

341
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,300
这没问题  他有问题
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

342
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,760
这两个完全一样的好不好
It's exactly the same...

343
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,400
佩妮  佩妮  让我来搞定好了
Penny, penny, I think I know what to do.

344
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,500
谢尔顿  我要告诉你一些坏消息
Sheldon, I have some bad news.

345
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,960
还有
More?

346
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,260
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

347
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,830
你礼拜一的腰果鸡丁
You know the cashew chicken I get you monday nights?

348
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,600
是的  四川宫的
Yes. from szechuan palace.

349
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,370
四川宫两年前倒闭了
Szechuan palace closed two years ago.

350
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,200
什么
What?

351
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
那我的鸡丁哪里来的
Where did my cashew chicken come from?

352
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,400
金龙饭店
Golden dragon.

353
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,260
不
No.

354
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,460
不  这不可能的
No, this isn't right.

355
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,860
外卖盒子一直是四川宫的
Our food always comes in szechuan palace containers.

356
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,360
他们倒闭的时候
Yeah, well, before they went out of business,

357
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,800
我买了四千个他们的盒子
I bought 4,000 containers.

358
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,760
然后藏在我车子后面
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

359
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,000
但是
But...

360
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,860
天哪  一切都不同了
Oh, this changes everything.

361
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,730
我觉得这样他就不会去想坐垫
I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
什么是真实  什么是虚假
What's real? what isn't?

363
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,730
我怎么才能知道
How can I know?

364
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
你编故事的是不
You did make that up, right?

365
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,960
我倒希望是编的
Oh, god, I wish I had.

366
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,660
莱纳德?
Leonard?

367
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,560
怎么老兄
Yeah, buddy?

368
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,460
我还是不喜欢这个垫子
I still don't like this cushion.

369
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,940
首先  佩妮感谢你能加入我们
Ok first of all, penny, thank you for coming.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
谢谢你买的鞋子
Thanks for the shoes.

371
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,770
佩妮射击很牛叉
Penny is an amazing shot.

372
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,600
我想我们这次很可能会赢
I think we have a real chance to win this week.

373
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,600
什么策略
What's the plan?

374
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,340
好  我们先跑出去
Okay. now, we all run out.

375
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,770
谢尔顿和我在树那边切断他们的左路
Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees.

376
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,490
拉杰 和霍华德 还有莱斯利
Raj, howard and leslie

377
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,140
你们从石头后面包抄
flank to the right behind the rocks.

378
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,950
这样佩妮的视野就开阔了
Then we'll all have a great view as penny

379
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,800
然后她把视野内所有敌人消灭
Runs out and kills everyone else in sight.

380
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,770
我们开始前还有一件事
Just one thing before we start.

381
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,670
什么  谢尔顿
What is it, sheldon?

382
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,700
搞什么
What the hell?!

383
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,870
这是为我的坐垫
That was for my cushion.

384
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,440
谢尔顿  佩妮是我们唯一的希望
Sheldon, penny was our only hope.

385
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
对不起莱纳德
I'm sorry, leonard.

386
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,570
君子报仇十年不晚
But revenge is a dish best served cold.

387
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,700
去你的
Screw that.

388
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,360
她不能射我  她已经死了
She can't shoot me. she's dead.

389
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
是的  你不能
He's right. you can't.

390
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:35,060
好  如果我们要堕入无政府主义混乱的话...
Well, if we're going to descend into anarchy...

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,030
你们慢慢打  我们先走了
Okay, see you.

392
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,860
等等你们去哪儿
Where are you going?

393
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,460
投降  然后午饭
Surrender, then denny's.
