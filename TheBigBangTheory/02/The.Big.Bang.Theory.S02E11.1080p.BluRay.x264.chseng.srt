1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,060
你的论点完全缺乏科学价值
Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,390
这很明确 超人通过飞入"黄日"核武器 清理他的衣服
It is well established superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth's yellow sun,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,360
由此能清除所有污染物
which incinerates any contaminate matter

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,920
从而留下安全的氪星布料 既无损坏又完全清洁
and leaves the invulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,220
要是他弄了点氪星的物质在上面呢
What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,320
例如
Like what?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,260
我不知道  氪星的芥末
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,890
我觉得我们完全能认为氪星爆炸时
I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,760
已将所有氪星的调味品都摧毁了
were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,260
又或者它变成了芥末氪星石
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite,

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,690
唯一能摧毁 威胁地球的邪恶氪星热狗
the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,160
拉杰  拜托
Raj, please,

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,960
严肃点 超人的身体是氪星的 因此他的汗水也是氪星的
let's stay serious here. Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,620
对  要是沾到氪星汗渍呢
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,560
超人在地球不会出汗
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,060
好啊 他应邀去肯朵的波特城赴晚餐
Okay, he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,060
他把自己变小  进入该城 在那里  他失去了超能力
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now,

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,590
晚餐前  主人说 玩一会氪星绳球如何
before dinner, his host says, "Who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?"

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,180
超人说  可以啊  玩得大汗淋漓 回到地球
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat, comes back to Earth,

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,720
他的衣服已经沾了无法去除的氪星汗渍
his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,860
将死你
Boo ya.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,190
超人能在离开波特前
Superman would have taken his uniform

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,720
把衣服放到肯朵的干洗机清洗
to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,890
肯朵的干洗机  我放弃
"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,260
你们完全没法跟这人理论
You can't have a rational argument with this man.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,660
那不是去年赢得 麦克亚瑟天才奖的家伙吗
isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year?

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,590
不  别一次全部人看
No, not all at once.

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,090
那怎么看
Then how?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,360
莱纳德先看
Leonard.

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,260
现在轮到拉杰
Now, Raj.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,590
现在轮到谢尔顿
Now, Sheldon.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,490
我没看清  能再看一遍吗
I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,990
不行
No.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,020
是戴维·安德希尔  那又怎么样
It's David Underhill. So what?

35
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,160
怎么样
So what?

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,360
他对高能正点子的观察报告
His observation of high-energy positrons

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,060
首次确切证明了
has provided the first conclusive evidence

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,090
银河暗物质的存在
for the existence of galactic dark matter.

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,290
我只给你两个词
I have two words for you.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,690
一个是"太"  一个是"好了"
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,820
确实是很好
It <i>is</i> a big whoop.

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,260
这几乎颠覆了
It made almost all the work

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,060
所有你在这里做的工作成果
you've done since you've been here completely useless.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,220
-才怪  -才怪
Did not. Did, too.

45
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,320
才
Did...

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,590
好吧  有部分吧  但是
Okay, maybe  <i>some</i> of it, but...

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,120
这小子只是在天时地利的时候
Look, the guy was just in the right place,

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,760
利用范式方法重新解释了银河系
at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,320
纯粹是狗屎运
reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,660
不仅如此
In more ways than one.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,990
他长得很帅呢
He's a very handsome man.

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,460
对我没什么影响  如果换成我
Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way,

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,760
我会更像扎克·埃夫隆那种类型
I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,090
对  要是你能有那么一点像他
Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,390
打扰一下
Excuse me...

56
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,190
你是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德吗
Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,620
是的
Uh... yeah.

58
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,690
我是戴维·安德希尔
I'm David Underhill.

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,020
好的
Uh... y-yeah.

60
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,460
盖博豪斯博士说
Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,090
如果我要在光电倍增实验室准备试验
to set something up in the photomultiplier lab,

62
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,920
你能帮我忙
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

63
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,860
你要和我一起做实验
You want to work with <i>me?</i> Well,

64
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,090
你要是有时间的话  是的
if you have a little time, yeah.

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,590
哇  当然有
Wow.... Y-yeah, sure.

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,560
没问题
Yeah, no problem. Uh...

对了  恭喜你获得麦克亚瑟天才奖  我很崇拜你
Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.

拜拜
Bye-bye!

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,720
看什么看
What are you looking at?

77
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,220
没见过伪君子啊
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

78

《生活大爆炸》

Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
才有希望追上谢尔顿·库珀
if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper,

81
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,340
他在第九个计分格时占尽优势 最高记录68

82
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,120

Hey, guys!

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,260
那个不算
That doesn't count.

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,760
重来  重来
Do over! Do over!

85
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,260
Wii保龄球游戏里可是投球无回的
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,590
我的朋友做运动时总会有重来的
There are always do-overs when my people play sports.

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,460
有什么比Wii保龄球之夜 还重要的
Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night?

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,460
其实  我
Actually, I was...

89
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,260
这是反问句 没什么能比 Wii保龄球之夜重要
It's a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,490
得了吧  不就是个电子游戏嘛
Come on, it's just a video game.

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
而且我们玩得很逊

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,860
很好的队长动员演说嘛
Nice motivational speech from the team captain.

我去戴维·安德希尔那了
I was working with Dave Underhill.

哦 "戴维" 听起来莱纳德有了新的"好朋友"
Ooh, "Dave." Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

96
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,990
事实上 他真的很酷
Actually, he's pretty cool.

97
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,320
不仅仅因为他是个天才
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist,

98
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,720
他还是个黑钻[户外运动品牌]滑雪高手
but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier.

99
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,990

So? We're in a rock band.

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,860
不
No...

我们是在X-Box里面

感谢主音吉他手激动人心的致辞
Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.

104

他还很幽默
He's funny, too.

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,620
他还绘声绘色的模仿了
He does this hysterical impersonation

106
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,920
史蒂芬·霍金的电话性爱

107
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,860
你穿着什么呢
What are you wearing?

108
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,590
还是他演得比较像
That's not... He does it better.

109
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,290
总之 他说明天他要带我去体育馆
Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow,

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,990
我先回屋练练仰卧起坐的
so I'm gonna go practice my situps.

111
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,990
排山倒海的男性吸引
Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.

112
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,720
兄弟情的完美演绎
Yeah. It's officially a bro-mance.

113
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,990
嘿 谢尔顿 你和莱纳德要不要弄棵圣诞树?
Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?

114
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,620
不 我们不庆祝
No, because we don't celebrate

115
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,290
古老的异教农神节
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

116
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,860
农神节?
Saturnalia?

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,190
孩子们 过来坐好了
Gather round, kids,

118
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,590
又到谢尔顿最爱的圣诞特别节目时间了
it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,990
在基督教出现之前的那些岁月
In the pre-Christian era,

120
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,520
每当冬至来临大地枯萎
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,

121
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,990
异教徒把常青的枝杈带回家中
pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes

122
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,020
用这种形式来表示
as an act of sympathetic magic, intended

123
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,920
保护生命的本质直到春来再次到来
to guard the life essences of the plants until spring.

124
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,660
这种风俗后来
This custom was later appropriated

125
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,660
被北欧人继承  于是演变成了
by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
现在的圣诞树
the so-called Christmas tree.

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,490
那么查理·布朗  你看到什么叫做无聊了吧
And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.

128
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,160
好吧 谢谢
Okay, well, thank you

129
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,760
不过我给你和莱纳德
for that, but I got you and Leonard

130
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,320
买了点蠢蠢的小礼物
a few silly neighbor gifts, so I'll just

131
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,320
我回头搁我的圣诞树底下好了
put them under <i>my</i> tree.

132
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,190
等等!
Wait!

133
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,220
你给我买了个礼物?
You bought me a present?

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,390
你干吗要这么做?
Why would you do such a thing?

135
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,090
不知道 因为是圣诞节?
I don't know. 'Cause it's Christmas?

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,590
哦 佩妮 我知道你认为自己很大方
Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous,

137
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,490
但送礼是建立在互利互惠的原则上的
but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity.

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
你还没给我礼物
You haven't given me a gift.

139
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,690
就已经塞给我一份责任
You've given me an obligation.

140
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,960
别难过 佩妮 这是新手常犯的错
Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake.

141
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,360
我和谢尔顿过的第一个犹太教光明节
My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,

142
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,120
他对我吼了八个晚上
he yelled at me for eight nights.

143
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,590
没关系 你不用送我什么东西以表回馈
Now, hey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.

144
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,460
当然要 这种风俗的精髓就是
Of course I do. The essence of the custom

145
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,920
现在我不得不出去给你买点东西
is that I now have to go out and purchase for you

146
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,420
价值相当的礼物
a gift of commensurate value

147
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,660
这礼物得体现对我们友谊的相同的感知价值
and representing the same perceived level of friendship

148
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,860
这种感知价值体现于你送我的礼物
as that represented by the gift you've given me.

149
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,160
知道今年自杀率是怎么直线上升的了吧
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.

150
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,890
好吧  忘了这件事吧
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

151
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,160
我没有给你准备礼物
I'm not giving you a present.

152
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,120
太晚了  我都看到了  那个小精灵贴纸
No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker

153
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,290
上面写着  给谢尔顿
says, "To Sheldon."

154
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,120
木已成舟
The die has been cast.

155
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,590
冥冥有手写天书
[欧玛尔·海亚姆波斯诗人  此句曾被马丁·路德·金引用]

156
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,390
汉尼拔已经翻越了阿尔卑斯山
[迦太基名将汉尼拔曾率领军队及大象翻越积雪的阿尔卑斯山进入意大利]

157
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,720
我知道  有意思 特别是发生在别人身上
I know. It's funny when it's not happening to us.

158
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,390
谢尔顿  我非常非常抱歉
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

159
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,090
别  别  我自找的
No. No, I brought this on myself

160
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,620
谁让我不小心成为你生命中美好又重要的一部分呢
by being such an endearing and important part of your life.

161
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,190
谁开车带我去商场
I'm going to need a ride to the mall.

162
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,490
现在发生在咱们头上了
It's happening to us.

163
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,820
你还好吧
Are you gonna make it?

164
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,020
还好吧
Yeah, I guess.

165
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,220
好的
All right.

166
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,620
谢谢你让我开你的摩托
Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.

167
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,160
不客气
No problem.

168
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,520
我不知道它这么沉
I had no idea it was so heavy.

169
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,320
就这么压到我身上了是吧
The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?

170
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,020
是啊  还没跑起来算你走运
Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

171
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,990
-莱纳德您还好吧  -还好
-Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay? -Oh, yeah.

172
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,490
就是个摩托车小意外
It's just a little motorcycle accident.

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,360
我的天  你开得有多快
My God, how fast were you going?

174
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,920
不晓得  就在电光火石之间
I don't know. It's all such a blur.

175
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,490
很幽默  他连发动都发动不起来
Good one. He couldn't even get it started.

176
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,990
嗨  戴维
Hi. Dave. Hi.

177
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,120
佩妮  是你的摩托
Penny. So it's <i>your</i> motorcycle?

178
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,920
没摔坏吧
Is it okay?

179
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,920
没事
It's fine.

180
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,590
算那车走运
Lucky for the bike

181
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,820
有我的腿垫着
it landed on my leg.

182
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,120
你介意帮我搀这位机车选手一下么
You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?

183
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,360
好的好的
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

184
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,960
戴维你是怎么认识莱纳德的
So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?

185
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,160
我是个物理学家
I'm a physicist.

186
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,490
你才不是呢
No, you're not.

187
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,290
有什么奇怪的么
Why is that so surprising?

188
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,820
主要是我所认识的物理学家
Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know

189
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,490
都又白又宅
are indoorsy and pale.

190
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,820
我不是宅男
I'm not indoorsy.

191
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,490
我的防晒霜很好用
I just wear the appropriate sun block

192
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,720
所以黑色素沉淀得很少
because I don't take melanoma lightly.

193
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,960
那你是
So, are you

194
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,720
在和莱纳德一起做实验么
and Leonard working on an experiment together?

195
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,960
事实上我们在
Yeah, actually we are.

196
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,490
我们在检测光电倍增管的
Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels

197
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
辐射强度
of photomultiplier tubes

198
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,990
用在一种新的暗物质探测器上面的
for a new dark matter detector.

199
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,090
亲爱的
Uh, sweetie, sweetie,

200
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,420
我在和戴维说话
Dave was talking.

201
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,660
你知道的  我爱好科学
You know, I love science.

202
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,990
-从什么时候开始的  -一直都是啊
-Since when? -Since always.

203
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,320
叫我科学怪人吧  我就是为
Call me a geek, but I am just nuts

204
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,790
这些亚原子痴迷不已
for the whole subatomic- particle thing.

205
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,520
我叫你什么也不会叫你科学怪人的
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.

206
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,460
呵呵  我就是啊
Ha. Well, that's what I am--

207
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,790
怪才天后
queen of the nerds.

208
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,820
如果你愿意
Well, if you like,

209
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,790
我可以带你参观我们工作的实验室
I could show you the lab we're working in.

210
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,260
我们有一些很棒的玩意  激光器什么的
We've got some cool toys, you know-- lasers and stuff.

211
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,720
你知道么  我一直都想见识下真正的科学实验室
You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.

212
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,720
什么时候开始的
Since when?

213
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,560
一直都是呀
Since always.

214
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,260
莱纳德  你还好么
Leonard, are you okay here? Uh...

215
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,490
-还好吧  -我们现在就去如何
-Yeah. I guess. -How 'bout we go see it now?

216
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,420
之后我们可以到海边兜风
Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast,

217
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,860
再来点吃的东西
We grab a little bite to eat...

218
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,560
真不错
Um... Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

219
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,820
我去拿个外套
Let me just get my jacket.

220
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,620
她很可爱嘛
Boy, she'll do, huh?

221
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,160
是啊  如果你喜欢这个类型的
Yeah, if you like that type.

222
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,260
你和她
So, you and her...?

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
没关系  就是邻居
No, just neighbors.

224
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,590
真的
Really.

225
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
真难想象你就住她隔壁
I don't know how you live next door to that

226
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,760
居然没有什么行动
without doing something about it.

227
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,960
事实上
Actually...

228
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,660
科学就是我的爱人
science is my lady.

229
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,160
好吧  咱们走吧
Okay. Let's go.

230
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,160
好的
All right.

231
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,520
明天见  莱纳德
See you tomorrow, Leonard.

232
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,520
明天见  再见佩妮
See ya. 'Bye, Penny.

233
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,160
玩得开心
Have fun.

234
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
是谁
Yes?

235
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
你没带钥匙么
Did you forget your key?

236
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,190
我看这没有什么女人想要的
I don't see anything in here a woman would want.

237
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,320
开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

238
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,590
这里有身体乳液  沐浴精油  香皂
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

239
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,720
简直是雌激素的帽子戏法[三连发]
that's the estrogen hat trick.

240
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,190
我看是山寨版发音的
What it is is a cacophonous assault

241
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,920
尤加利属植物  月桂树的果实  肉桂和香草
of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

242
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,320
就好像我的头卡到土耳其皇帝的睡衣里面一样
It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.

243
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,420
谢尔顿  如果你不喜欢这些东西
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,

244
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,590
我们去隔壁给她做个填充玩具熊也行
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

245
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,360
告诉过你  我害怕熊
I told you before, bears are terrifying.

246
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,260
拜托
Come on,

247
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,190
沐浴用品  完美的选择
bath stuff. It's perfect!

248
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,090
这里有香氛蜡烛  洗面扑
You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff,

249
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,790
薄荷和绿茶味的沐浴精油  放松身心
spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.

250
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,560
前提假设是佩妮身心紧张
That presupposes Penny is tense.

251
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,890
她认识你  能不紧张么
She knows you. She's tense.

252
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,590
我们都紧张  买个礼品篮
We all are. Buy a basket!

253
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,090
您好  我们选好了
Excuse me, we're ready.

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,620
我们还没选好
No, we're not.

255
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,590
假设我同意
Let's say for a moment that I accept

256
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,390
沐浴礼品这个假设
the bath item gift hypothesis,

257
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
现在我要考考你了
I now lay the following conundrum at your feet:

258
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,890
我们该买多大的
Which size?

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,820
就这个  我们走
This one. Let's go.

260
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,420
你想都没想过
You put no thought into that.

261
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,860
不好意思  就这个
I'm sorry. Uh... this one.

262
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,760
我们走
Let's go!

263
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,760
我没有足够的数据进行分析
I have insufficient data to proceed.

264
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,160
不好意思小姐
Excuse me, miss?

265
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,390
什么事
Yes?

266
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,160
如果我送给你这个礼物篮
If I were to give you this gift basket,

267
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,690
根据这个行为本身  如果没有其他数据
based on that action alone and no other data,

268
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,460
请推断并描述我们之间的 假定关系
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.

269
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,290
不好意思
Excuse me?

270
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,420
这里
Here.

271
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,660
我们是朋友么
Now, are we friends?

272
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,490
同事还是情人
Colleagues? Lovers?

273
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,620
你是我的祖母么
Are you my grandmother?

274
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
我不明白你在说什么
I don't understand what you're talking about

275
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,460
不过你让我觉得有点不爽
and you're making me a little uncomfortable.

276
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,260
看到没  就像你和佩妮
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.

277
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,490
我们就要这个了
We'll take it.

278
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,160
莱纳德  过来一块儿坐
Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

279
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
哦  嘿  戴维
Oh, hey, Dave.

280
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,820
还有佩妮  你也在这
And Penny, what a surprise.

281
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,190
嘿 莱纳德
Hey, Leonard.

282
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,420
戴维刚刚带我在校园里逛了逛
Dave was just showing me around the university.

283
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,920
你知道么 这个地方真是妙不可言
You know, this place is unbelievable!

284
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,760
我当然知道 这一年半我一直说要带你来看看
Yeah, I know. I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half.

285
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,590
你总是说你要去练瑜伽
You always said you had yoga.

286
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,320
从没说过
I never said that.

287
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,260
可能我听错了
Maybe I heard you wrong.

288
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,760
有很多词听起来像瑜伽
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

289
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,090
莱纳德 这真是一个很奇妙的女人
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.

290
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,290
她的思想敏捷而又有求知欲
She has a curious and agile mind,

291
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
更不用提她其他敏捷而奇特的方面了
not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.

292
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,360
别说了
Oh, shut up!

293
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,020
没错 闭嘴吧
Yes, please shut up.

294
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,590
那么  戴维
So, um, Dave,

295
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,960
我们是不是该回实验室干活了?
don't you think you and I should get back to the lab?

296
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,360
你知道 暗物质是不会去自己发现自己的
You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.

297
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,490
我正想下午请个假
Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off

298
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,420
然后和佩妮做个别的"实验"
so I could work on another experiment with Penny.

299
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,260
我们去做实验?
Really? We're going to do an experiment?

300
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,290
我们去试试龙舌兰酒
Uh-huh. We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots

301
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,790
在一个22岁尤物身上会有什么作用
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

302
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,120
那不是实验
It's not an experiment!

303
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,120
再说你昨晚也见到会发生什么了
You saw what happened last night.

304
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,520
走么?  好
You ready to go? Yeah.

305
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,760
噢  我能骑摩托车吗
Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?

306
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,020
可以啊  有什么不行的
Yeah, why not?

307
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,190
你肯定不会比莱纳德开得还糟的
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

308
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,560
真有趣啊
That's funny.

309
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,520
顺便说一句  我的腿疼死了
By the way, my leg is killing me.

310
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,890
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

311
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,200
大新闻  莱纳德
Mmm, great news, Leonard.

312
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,460
我已经解决了送佩妮礼物的两难困境了
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

313
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,760
我好高兴哦
Yippee.

314
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,830
你想啊  我可能会送得过于好或过于寒碜
You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate,

315
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,830
但我已经想出了一个很简单的点子
but I have devised a foolproof plan.

316
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,760
我会先打开她给我的礼物
See, I will open her gift to me first

317
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,200
接着借故离开
and then excuse myself,

318
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,030
假装消化不良
feigning digestive distress.

319
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,030
然后我会上网查她送的礼物的价格
Then I'll look up the price of her gift online,

320
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,730
从篮子里选一样价格最接近的东西 送给她
choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her

321
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,530
最后我把剩下来的以全价退回去
and then I'll return the others for a full refund.

322
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,930
真聪明啊
Brilliant.

323
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,460
的确如此
It is, isn't it?

324
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,100
我可以把这些东西藏在你房间里吗
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

325
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,100
这气味让我想吐
The smell makes me nauseated.

326
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,500
随便你怎么弄啦
Do whatever you want.

327
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,430
谢谢  你真是太高尚了
Thank you, that's very gracious.

328
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,230
先生们
Gentlemen.

329
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,730
你为什么不做莱纳德才做的事情
Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did

330
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,730
给佩妮介绍个男朋友
and get Penny a new boyfriend?

331
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,460
我的腿疼死了
My leg is killing me.

332
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,830
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

333
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,700
我只有一个问题想问你
Okay, I have just one question for you.

334
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,500
当我很开心的和你在一起的时候
While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us,

335
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,900
你说你不想和我约会
you said that you didn't want

336
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
只是因为我对你来说太聪明了
to go out with me because I was too smart for you!

337
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,260
那好吧  新闻来了  女士
Well, news flash, lady

338
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,730
戴维·安德希尔比我聪明十倍
David Underhill is ten times smarter than me!

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,030
对我来说  你得把一个道钉钉进
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain

340
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,360
他脑子里  我才能在国际跳棋中打败他
for me to beat him at checkers!

341
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,630
和他相比
Next to him,

342
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,760
我比较像那些打手语的大猩猩之一
I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas

343
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,030
只知道怎么要葡萄
who knows how to ask for grapes!

344
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,060
所以  我的问题是...
So, my question is...

345
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,100
我聪明又怎么了啊
What's up with that?!

346
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,530
你干嘛对我大吼大叫啊
Why are you yelling at me?

347
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,630
对不起  对不起  对不起
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

348
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,260
别介意  我们没事了
Never mind, we're cool.

349
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,730
戴维并没有你聪明
Dave is not smarter than you.

350
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,030
他是个白痴
He's an idiot.

351
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,360
真的吗  你为什么这么说啊
Really? Why would you say that?

352
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,830
因为聪明的人会把他老婆的裸照从手机里删了
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife

353
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,100
在他打算把他女朋友的裸照 存进手机之前
off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.

354
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,660
他打算给你拍裸照吗
He tried to take nude photos of you?

355
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,600
你就听到了这个
That's what you took from that?!

356
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,560
这家伙已经结婚了
The guy is married!

357
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,960
噢  是的
Oh, yeah.

358
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,660
对不起  那真是太糟糕了
I'm so-- Oh, that's terrible.

359
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,360
而你  如果你和我约会的时候
And you, if you are so okay

360
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,530
是很开心的
with the way things are between us,

361
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
你干嘛这么嫉妒啊
why are you so jealous?

362
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,230
恩...
Well, uh...

363
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,560
重要的是他已经结婚了  而且这太糟糕了
The important thing is he's married and that's terrible!

364
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,130
球救得好啊  天才啊
Nice save, genius.

365
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,600
蛋酒要吗
Eggnog?

366
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,930
我不能吃乳糖
Lactose.

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,960
里面只有朗姆酒
It's just rum.

368
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,400
在半小时前里面就已经不是蛋酒了
It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.

369
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,100
很好喝啊
Smooth.

370
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,500
比你更味美啊
Smoother than you.

371
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,160
拜托  现在是圣诞节  就这么对我啊
Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.

372
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,060
好吧  圣诞快乐
Okay, Merry Christmas.

373
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
顺便提一句  我的腿疼死了
By the way, my leg is killing me.

374
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,400
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

375
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,000
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

376
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,100
你的腿怎么样了
How's your leg?

377
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,430
很好  谢谢关心  进来吧
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.

378
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,400
哦  真棒  佩妮  你来和我交换礼物了
Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts.

379
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,960
当你知道无论你送什么
You'll be pleased to know

380
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,330
我都有相应的准备着  你会很高兴的
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

381
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,930
好的  给你
Okay, here.

382
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,330
我要声明一下  我现在有些消化不良
I should note I'm having some digestive distress,

383
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,930
所以  如果我突然离开一下  不要惊异哦
so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed.

384
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,400
噢  一条餐巾
Oh, a napkin.

385
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,330
把它翻过来
Turn it over.

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,360
送给谢尔顿
"To Sheldon,

387
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,800
多福多寿
"live long and prosper.

388
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,100
莱纳德·尼莫哀致[《星际迷航》中演员]
Leonard Nimoy."

389
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,060
是的  他来饭馆
Yeah, he came into the restaurant.

390
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,200
很抱歉餐巾脏了  他用它擦过嘴了
Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

391
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,800
我有莱纳德·尼莫哀的DNA了
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

392
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,300
对啊...
Well...

393
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,960
是  是的  我想是这样的
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

394
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,930
但是  看哪  他还在上面签名了
But look, he signed it.

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,860
你难道没有意识到这意味着什么吗
Do you realize what this means?!

396
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,700
我只需要一颗健康的卵子
All I need is a healthy ovum

397
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,030
我就可以培育出我的莱纳德·尼莫哀了
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

398
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,230
好吧  我给你的只是餐巾而已  谢尔顿
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.

399
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,400
我马上回来
Be right back.

400
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
给你的  打开吧
Here. Open it.

401
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,230
噢  一份摩托车课程的及格证书
Oh, a gift cerficate for motorcycle lessons.

402
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,130
真会体贴人啊
Very thoughtful.

403
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
是啊  而且我查过了
Yeah, and I checked.

404
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,600
第一课就是不会让你再从车上摔下来
Not letting the bike fall on you

405
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,630
而且是车还在原地没动的时候
while standing still is lesson one.

406
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,100
噢  那么  我想你看到我送你的东西  你会很感动的
Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.

407
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
好的
Okay.

408
