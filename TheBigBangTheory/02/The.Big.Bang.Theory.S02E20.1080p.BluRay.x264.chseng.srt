1
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,210
有问题吗
Problem?

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,210
-这是泰国菜  -又来了
- This is Thai food. - Here we go.

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,030
我们周四不吃泰国菜
We don't have Thai food on thursday.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,410
我们吃批萨
We have pizza on thursday.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,970
对  但我们说过每月第三个星期四
Yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,450
是一切皆有可能的星期四
At every month would be anything can happen thursday.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,880
显然没有满足我的消化系统要求
Well, apparently that you didn't reach my digestive system

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,810
在一切皆有可能的星期四
which when startle has its own version

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,330
也有自己的要求
On anything can happen thursday.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,980
拜托  一切皆有可能的星期四
Come on, the whole idea hehind anything can happen thursday

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,260
它的含义是摆脱近期的刻板生活
Is to get out this rut we've been in lately.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,960
刻板  你是说连贯性吧
Rut? i think you mean consistency.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,470
如果要废除这个
And if we're going to abandon that,

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,910
那干嘛要叫它星期四
Then why even call it thursday?

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,540
直接称为狂口日
Let's call it quorncle day,

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,660
分为29小时17分钟
And divide it into 29 hours and 17 minutes a piece,

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,700
杀鸡宰羊来庆祝 感谢万能的刻板之主
And celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god rut.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,820
我同意杀鸡宰羊
I can go for some goat.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,610
谢尔顿  我们说好今晚做点改变
Seldon, we agreed we do something different tonight.

20
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,870
好啊

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,920
我们去漫画书店吧
Let's go to the comic book store.

22

我们昨晚就去过了

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,390
因为今天是一切皆有可能的星期四
Because it is Anything Can Happen Thursday

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,540
何必出去
Rather then get outside,

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,860
在饭盒面前拜神啊  谢尔顿
But praise right up against the box, Sheldon.

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
我们今晚到底干什么
So what are we gonna do tonight?

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,260
听我的建议吧
If I may profer a suggestion

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,980
在这个国家广袤的土地上林立着无数个酒吧
in bars, all across this great nation

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,870
我们的周四应该是美女之夜

36
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,220
拜托  霍华德
Come on Howard,

37
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,210
我们在酒吧泡妞的成功率几乎为零
The odds of us picking up girls at bar is practically zero

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,660
你听过德瑞克方程式么

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,520
那个用来估算 与外星人接触的概率

一系列分数值的乘积

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,710
比如具有行星的星系

43
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,220
或者有生命存在的行星

对  就是那个
Yeah, That one.

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,850
你可以通过把

47
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,590
数据改成洛城单身女人的数量和
by changing the formula to use the number of single women in LA

48
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,910
通过沃罗威茨系数计算出来天仙妹妹数量
and the number of those i find attractive

49
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,100
用来计算我们有爱可做的概率
by what i call the wolowitz coefficient

50
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,700
沃罗威茨系数?
The wolowitz coefficient?

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,720
欲望*次数*压力的平方
needing us times stress size square

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,210
计数来看

up with conservative 5812 potential sex partners within a 40miles radius

54

你开玩笑吧

我是个性饥渴的工程师  莱纳德

我从不拿数学和性开玩笑

57
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,880
那还等什么  俺们快去钓马子

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,850
你说得对
oh, you're right.

59
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,770
今天是一切皆有可能的星期四

60
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,340
大家去酒吧美眉

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,280
太对了  看好女儿哦

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,610
不然我们上完可不买账哦
we're going to hit them and quit them.

63
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,640
还是吃完东西去漫画书店吧
or we can finish eating and then go to the comic book store.

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,950
也是个好主意

65
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,920
好吧  但下个一切皆有可能的星期四

You heard that ladies night, ladies we are eventually coming for you.

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,530
有意思

70
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,470
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第20集

71
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,670
伙计们  去哪儿
Oh Hey Guys, Where are you heading?

72
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,850
漫画书店
To the comic bookstore.

73
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,250
你可能在想  星期三去漫画书店
You are probably thinking the comic bookstore on a Thursday

74
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,450

你们能不能帮我挑几本漫画
Oh hey, while you are there could you pick me up a few comics

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,810
给我外甥当生日礼物
for my nephew's birthday?

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,140
你说的是漫画书吧
No, I think you mean comic books

81
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,520
漫画只是苍白无力的幽默
comics are feeble attempts humor featuring

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,870
搞些说话的小人儿  拟人的宠物

83
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,500
旧时有个乐观的名字叫"开心一刻"

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,820
莱纳德能不能帮我挑几本漫画
Leonard can you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

85
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,950
好啊  他爱看什么
Sure what does he like?

86
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,110
不晓得  他才13岁  随便挑吧
I don't know. he is thirteen, just pick out anything.

87
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,510
随便挑?
Just pick out anything?

88
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,270
说不定我们能在不知道尺码的情况下
May be the same time we can pick out a new suit for him

89
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,870
给他挑一套新衣服
without knowing his size.

90
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,230
或者在不知道他职业倾向的情况下

or pick out his breakfast cereal

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,890
给他挑一盒早餐麦片
without knowing his fiber requirements

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,390
或者他喜不喜欢小软糖
Or his feelings about little marshmallows.

95
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,020
《蜘蛛侠》  给他挑《蜘蛛侠》
Spider-man. get him spider-man.

96
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,830
《神奇蜘蛛侠》  《终极蜘蛛侠》  《惊奇蜘蛛侠》
Amazing spider-man, ultimate spider-man, spectacular spider-man,

The marvelous adventures of spider-man, spider-man 2099?

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,750
莱纳德
Leonard?

99
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,150
你知道他会说个没完
You know this can go on all night.

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,420
直接跟我们去吧
Why don't you just come with us?

101
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,330
我就是不想跟你们去
That's what I was trying to avoid.

102
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,290
我把《惊叹蜘蛛侠》给忘了
Oh, I forgot sensational spider-man.

103
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,840
多可爱的小店啊
Aw, what a cute, little store.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,690
大家都盯着我
Ev-everybody's staring at me.

105
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,690
别担心  他们比你还惊讶呢
Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them.

106
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,020
咋不像呢
Unlikely.

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,890
送这个给我侄子怎么样
Here, what about this one for my nephew?

108
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,390
-眼光一流  -太好了
- A superb choice. - oh, great.

109
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,480
但他必须看过《无限危机》和《52》
Provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52,

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,290
还要熟悉DC的多元宇宙重建
And is familiar with the reestablishment of the dc multiverse.

111
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,350
什么是多元宇宙
What's a "multiverse"?

112
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
带她出去
Get her out of here.

113
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,250
来吧  我帮你选
Come on, I'll help you pick something.

114
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,620
没错  她和我们是一起的
That's right. she's with us.

115
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,420
这些家伙真可怜
Guys like that are so pathetic.

116
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,850
说说看
Tell me about it.

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,620
瞧  新版蝙蝠侠皮带扣哦
Ooh, look, a new batman belt buckle.

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,020

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,820
你好  史都华  这是佩妮

她想买几本漫画书
She's just looking for some comic books.

122
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,790
是吗
Oh, really, wow.

123
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,020
如果不是自愿来的  眨两下眼睛
Blink twice if you're here against your will.

124
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,990
还好啦  史都华
I think we're fine, stuart.

125
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,320

他人好像挺不错呢
Oh, he seems like a nice guy.

128
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,950
你说喜欢漫画的人吗
You mean for someone who's into comic books?

129
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,320
不  不是
No. no-no-no.

130
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,020
我是说...没错
I just meant for... yeah.

131
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,330
佩妮
Penny,

132
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,850
喜欢漫画不代表就是怪人
Just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos.

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,650
史都华是个天才艺术家呢
Stuart's a terrific artist.

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,820
他在罗德岛学校学过设计
He went to the rhode island school of design.

135
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,840

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,090
还塞进运动裤的人呢

137
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,020
那是运动裤船长
Uh, yeah, that's captain sweatpants.

138
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,890
他确实不是我说的那种人
He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:14,090
-买过  -买过
- Got it. - got it.

140
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,520
-没买  - 没买
- Need it! - Need it!

141
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,530
放手  谢尔顿
Let it go, sheldon.

142
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,330
为什么  我先看到的
Why should I let go? I saw it first.

143
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,290
但我从正面看到的
Yes, but I saw it from the front.

144
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,860
这算什么伎俩
A far less impressive feat.

145
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,960
拜托
Oh, come on!

146
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,660
我要收藏《蝙蝠侠》系列的
I need this for my batman collection.

147
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,360
我还要收藏《神通罗宾》呢
Well, I need it for my robin collection.

148
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,030
石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克
Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock?

149
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,130
我干嘛要冒险
Why would I gamble?

150
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
我的  放手
It's mine. let go.

151
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,490
-你放手  -你放手
- You let go. - no, you!

152
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
-你放手  -怎么回事
- No, you! - problem?

153
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,460
他抢我的漫画书
Yes. he won't let go of my comic book.

154
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,530
是我的才对
It's my comic book!

155
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,960
莱纳德  做个裁决
Leonard, we need a ruling.

156
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,660
裁两半吧
Cut it in half?

157
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,490
打扰一下
Excuse me.

158
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,630
你好啊
Oh, hello again.

159
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,060
给13岁男孩的礼物  你有什么推荐
Hi. what would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

160
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,730
13岁的女孩
A 13-year-old girl.

161
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,890
如果你一定要选漫画的话  试试这个
But if you're dead set on a comic book, try... this.

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,190
《地狱神探》
Oh, hellblazer.

163
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,330
讲什么的
What's this about?

164
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,290
一个走在正邪之间  因抽烟患有肺癌
A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes,

165
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,430
被不死的灵魂折磨着的男人的故事
Has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.

166
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,630
如果这个还不能让我成为最受欢迎阿姨
Well, if that doesn't make me the favorite aunt,

167
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,030
真不知道什么会了
I don't know what will.

168
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,890
这画的是我?
Is this me?

169
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,230
看情况了  你喜欢么
Depends. do you like it?

170
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,330
画的真棒
Wow, it's really good.

171
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,830
没错  就是你
Yes, that's you.

172
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,290
太可爱了  但如果我不喜欢呢
That's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?

173
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,560
还是你  不过我就是个傻瓜
It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.

174
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,890
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
史都华在对佩妮采取行动
Stuart's putting the moves on penny.

176
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,230
我真该学学怎么画画
I have got to learn how to draw.

177
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,690
再一次  你被你的恶趣味打败
Hey! once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,130
哥几个  你们有没有发现史都华霸着佩妮不放?
Guys, have you seen stuart all up in penny's business over there?

179
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,360
没人霸着谁
Nobody's up in anybody's business.

180
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,260
买完东西赶紧闪人吧
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

181
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,730
你有我的电话号码了
Okay, you've got my number.

182
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,860
现在  把这幅画给我吧
Now, give me the picture.

183
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,630
你真会砍价
You drive a hard bargain.

184
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,760
给你
But here.

185
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,930
记得打电话给我
All right. so, um, just give me a call.

186
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,590
莱纳德  你现在对"周四夜惊喜"怎么看
So, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday?

187
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,460
快看
Look at that.

188
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,530
这有个凹痕
That's a dent.

189
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,530
谢谢  霍华德·"大拳"·沃罗威茨
Thank you, howard "ham-fisted" wolowitz.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,840
你在初版星际旅行"毛球的麻烦"
Did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic

191
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,890
播到一半时居然把电视关了?
The original series "trouble with tribbles" crossover episode?

192
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,330
显然是这样的
Apparently so.

193
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,190
你生病了?
Are you ill?

194
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,530
-没有  -好的
- No. - all right.

195
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,440
这么说你就是因为今天早些时候
Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of

196
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,860
佩妮的事而在生闷气咯
Emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening?

197
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,730
你什么时候注意到的?
When did you pick up on that?

198
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,470
就在刚才
A moment ago,

199
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,680
看"毛球的麻烦"[《星际旅行》中的的经典篇章]
When you turned off the tv in the middle of the classic

200
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
看到一半把电视关了的时候
The original series "trouble with tribbles" crossover episode.

201
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,230
想听听我的建议么
Would you like some advice?

202
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,360
当然了
Sure, why not?

203
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,180
现在正是你写那种大家可以留言的
Well then,This is the perfect time to launch a

204
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,830
博客的好时机
Blog with an interactive comments section?

205
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,360
真是谢谢你了
Gee, thanks a lot.

206
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,590
你想听听我对此事的看法么
Would you rather I offer my personal insight?

207
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,690
不必了
I don't need any insights.

208
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,090
我只想知道为什么佩妮对史都华比对我感兴趣
I just want to know why penny's more interested in stuart than me.

209
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,860
我们差不多啊
We're practically the same guy.

210
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,160
我不同意
Oh, I disagree.

211
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,920
斯图尔特更高更有才  自己当老板
Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly,

212
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,590
更重要的是  他买漫画打五五折
He gets 45 percent off comic books.

213
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,930
你说的没错
You're right.

214
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,160
我真该上网寻求陌生人的帮助
I really should be asking strangers on the internet.

215
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,090
我早就说了
My original point.

216
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,060
中国菜  老式游戏
Chinese food, vintage video games...

217
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,290
经历了不可思议的周四的噩梦
After the nightmare of anything can happen thursday,

218
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,390
现在是遵循我所有习惯的周五了
This is friday night the way it was meant to be.

219
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,190
谁同意周六来个无谢尔顿日
Who's up for sheldon-free saturday?

220
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,830
大家好
Oh, hey, guys.

221
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,730
佩妮好  还有史都华
Hey, penny... and stuart.

222
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,860
史都华好
Hey, stuart.

223
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,160
大家好
Hey, guys.

224
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,660
你们哪玩去
So what are you kids up to?

225
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,430
画展有史都华的一幅画  今天正好开幕
Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.

226
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,860
你们两个一起去呀  真好
And you guys are going together. great...

227
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,030
真不错
It is great.

228
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,360
真的很不错
Really great.

229
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,190
简直棒极了
Freaking awesome.

230
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,830
你们打算干什么
What are you guys doing?

231
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,740
今天是周五  也就是中国菜和老式游戏
It's friday night-- that means chinese food and vintage video games,

232
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,090
对不
Right?

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,460
老式这个词不足以形容我们的计划
Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned.

234
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,890
今夜  我们要玩经典的1980冒险游戏ZORK
Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, zork.

235
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,260
而且是有漏洞的贝塔版
It's the buggy beta version.

236
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,260
强  ZORK呢
Wow, zork.

237
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,460
你们玩得开心
Well, you guys have fun.

238
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,330
再见
Yeah. see you guys.

239
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,590
再见  史都华
See you, stuart.

240
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,830
-霍华德  -什么
- Hey, howard? - yes?

241
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,130
带我去酒吧泡妞
Take me to a bar with women.

242
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,030
-真的吗   -对
- Really? - yeah.

243
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,660
好
Okay!

244
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,190
我先进去把内裤脱了
Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.

245
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,560
为什么
Why?

246
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,690
如果今晚走运  我可不想被潜水侠内裤卡住
Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my aquaman briefs.

247
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,320
来杯鸡尾酒  上面插把小雨伞
May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?

248
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,620
-不  不用了    -为什么
- No, he may not. - why?

249
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,600
我才不会和一个喝鸡尾酒
I'm not sitting here with a guy

250
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,520
还要插把雨伞的人坐一起
Drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.

251
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,220
好吧
Fine.

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
换巧克力马提尼
I'll have a chocolate martini.

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,060
又错了
Wrong again!

254
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,470
拜托 你知道我不醉得像
Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless

255
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,000
印度灯节里的灯那么旺就没法搭讪
I'm lit up like the hindu festival of dewali.

256
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,860
听着  洛城有很多酒吧
Look, There are plenty of bars in los angeles

257
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
可以让你点这些加巧克力的鸡尾酒和巧克力马丁尼
where you can order grasshoppers and Chocolate martinis,

258
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,460
但去那里已没必要点  因为没女人了
but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.

259
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,630
开窍了
gotcha.

260
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,220
我点杯白兰地亚历山大
I'll have a brandy alexander.

261
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,900
三剑客变成双飞侠了
All right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo.

262
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
我们不去勾搭那些女的?
Should we talk to some of these women?

263
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,160
不  现在还太早了
No. it's way too early in the night for that.

264
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,330
先让律师和运动员挑肥拣瘦  然后呢
See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then...

265
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,130
我们就直接上老弱病残的
We go after the weak and the old and the lame.

266
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,660
这就是你的秘诀
That's your system?

267
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,230
没错
That's my system.

268
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,230
如果看到有个带导盲犬的妞  她是我的
Oh, and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she's mine.

269
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,260
拜托
Oh, come on.

270
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,470
我感觉运动裤船长参加你的开幕式也无妨
I think it's nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening.

271
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,600
如果他没碰所有奶酪的话更好
Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

272
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,240
时间还早
You know, it's kind of early.

273
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,340
你想喝点咖啡什么的吗
Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?

274
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,700
好像咖啡晚了点啊
Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?

275
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,800
你以为喝咖啡只是喝咖啡呢
Oh, you think "coffee," means coffee.

276
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,270
太纯洁了
That is so sweet.

277
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,400
来吧  我有脱咖啡因的
Come on. I think I have decaf.

278
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,170
太好了  史都华
Oh, good. stuart.

279
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,540
我听到你在说话
I thought I heard your voice.

280
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,170
你有空吗
Do you have a moment?

281
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,340
大概吧
Uh, yeah, I guess.

282
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,840
谢尔顿   我们有点忙
Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so...

283
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,770
你们干啥呢
What are you doing?

284
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,970
我们要喝咖啡
We're having coffee.

285
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,270
现在喝咖啡太晚了吧
Well, isn't it a little late for coffee?

286
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,270
没事  她有脱咖啡因的
It's okay. she thinks she has decaf.

287
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,470
我去找找
I'll just go look for it.

288
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,900
怎么了
What's up?

289
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,740
我刚才三小时都在网上蝙蝠侠
Well,  I've spent the last three hours in an online debate

290
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,570
坛子上辩论  想找你帮忙
In the dc comics batman chatroom, and I need your help.

291
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,940
那些小子很顽固的
Oh, yeah. those guys can be very stubborn.

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,100
什么话题
What's the topic?

293
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,630
我觉得如果蝙蝠侠的死是永久的
I am asserting, in the event that batman's death proves permanent,

294
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,380
那么第一任罗宾  迪克·格雷森
The original robin, dick grayson,

295
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,740
是他最合逻辑的继任人
Is the logical successor to the bat cowl.

296
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,300
谢尔顿   恐怕你错得太离谱了
Ooh. sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.

297
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
什么
More wrong?

298
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,700
错是绝对化的  没有比较级的
Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.

299
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,100
当然有
Of course it is.

300
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,300
说番茄是蔬菜是小错
It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable.

301
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,970
说番茄是悬索桥是大错特错
It's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge.

302
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,050
话说回来   迪克后来成了黑翼侠
But returning to the original issue, dick grayson became nightwing,

303
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,940
单独成英雄了
A superhero in his own right.

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,800
蝙蝠侠二代肯定是第二任罗宾  杰森·托特
Batman 2 has to be the second robin, jason todd.

305
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,270
肯定  肯定
Has to be? has to be?

306
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,340
我看你是故意挑衅
I hope you're being deliberately provocative.

307
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,870
我找到了
I found the decaf!

308
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,000
太好了
Oh, great!

309
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,400
给我一杯凉茶
Herbal tea for me, please.

310
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,030
酒保 来杯亚历山大鸡尾酒
Barkeep! Alexander me.

311
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,910
那边两个怎么样
How about those two?

312
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,890
不行 她们在吃花生呢
No... They're eating peanuts.

313
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,900
我又过敏  亲个嘴估计就得在西奈医院呆一周
And my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedars-sinai for a week.

314
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,650
角落里的那个呢
What about the ones in the corner?

315
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,020
有希望  很有希望
Possible. very possible.

316
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,990
你是想要那个戴颈圈的呢
Do you want the one in the whiplash collar

317
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,590
还是老眨眼睛的那个呢
or the one who keeps blinking?

318
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,420
我觉得眨眼睛的比较可爱
I think blinky's cute.

319
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,190
行  就这样
You got it, sir.

320
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,920
等等  我们就这样过去
Wait, so we just go over there?

321
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,090
别急
No.

322
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,050
我们不打无准备之仗
We have a little prep work to do.

323
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,990
把这个放进嘴里
Put this in your mouth.

324
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,520
我们经过她们身边  你打个趔趄
We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

325
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,820
我就说  抱歉  我朋友呢...
I say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much.

326
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,650
然后从你嘴里拉这个出来
And then I start to pull it out of your mouth.

327
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
然后说  他吃饱了撑的
And say, "a little too much fun."

328
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,550
懂了没
Get it?

329
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,550
她们会笑  我们也很开心
I mean, they're laughing. we're laughing.

330
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,560
接下来我们把姑娘们灌到
Then we get them up to about a .

331
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,450
血液中酒精浓度等级为15的时候
15 blood alcohol level,

332
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,050
告诉她们咱是大款
and tell them we're millionaires.

333
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,790
还有没有别的
What else you got?

334
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,120
看情况了
Depends.

335
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,050
你愿意坐我腿上  装做表演口技的傻子吗
Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?

336
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
不愿意
No.

337
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,950
我不能坐你腿上  你不懂规则
I can't sit on your lap. you don't know the routine.

338
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,420
抱歉  但你明显局限在前零点时期的DC宇宙了
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-zero hour dc universe.

339
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,750
当然了
Of course I am.

340
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,960
去掉杀害蝙蝠侠父母的杀手乔·齐尔
Removing joe chill as the killer of batman's

341
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,650
明显剥夺了这个角色存在的理由
Parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'etre.

342
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:43,940
好吧
Okay.

343
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,050
你可以随便秀法语  但不能证明你是对的
You can throw all the french around you want, it doesn't make you right.

344
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,450
[法语]正好相反
Au contraire.

345
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:50,770
另外
Plus,

346
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,440
你忘了《无限危机》的故事情节
You're forgetting that the infinite crisis

347
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,890
又将乔·齐尔囊括进《蝙蝠侠传奇》中了
Storyline restored joe chill to the batman mythology.

348
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,420
我什么都没忘  而且我很厌恶你的语气
I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.

349
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,920
行
Okay.

350
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,820
谢尔顿  现在很晚了 我得去睡会儿
Look, sheldon, it's late. I've got to get some sleep.

351
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,950
那么 我赢了
So, I win.

352
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,250
没门  我是累了要休息
No, I'm tired.

353
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,390
那么  还是我赢了
So, I win.

354
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,820
好吧  你赢了
Fine. you win.

355
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,420
没错  我赢了
Darn tootin', I win.

356
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,120
佩妮  我今天真的很高兴
Penny, I really had a terrific time...

357
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,290
佩妮
Penny?

358
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,920
不  千万别叫醒她
No, no, no, no, no. don't wake her.

359
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,250
否则她会像金刚狼一样把你暴打一顿
She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.

360
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,250
我喝的好象不是无咖啡因咖啡
You know, I don't think that was decaf.

361
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,970
等一下  这是不是你选的那张牌
Wait. is this your card or isn't it?

362
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,610
相信我  这是她们选的牌
Trust me. this was their card.

363
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,440
我还以为你很擅长泡妞
I thought you were good at this.

364
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,710
你总是讲怎么去酒吧泡妞
You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.

365
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,670
我经常做啊
I do, all the time.

366
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,570
那现在呢
Well, what happened?

367
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,750
我们在这坐了快一晚上
We've been sitting here all night and the longest

368
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,570
跟你谈话最长的却是打电话给你的老妈
Conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.

369
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,210
你就是要逼我说出口  对吧
Wow. you're just going to make me come out and say it, aren't you?

370
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,810
说什么
Say what?

371
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,340
你拖我后腿了
You're weighing me down.

372
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,810
我是只猎鹰  单飞时收获更好
I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

373
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,810
行  我坐着  你去翱翔捕猎吧
Fine. I'll sit here. you take flight and hunt.

374
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,240
别逗了
Don't be ridiculous.

375
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,540
怎么能告诉猎鹰什么时候去捕猎
You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.

376
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,440
实际上  可以的
Actually, you can.

377
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,370
周围都是猎物呢
There's whole sport built around it.

378
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,970
小猎鹰
Falconry.

379
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,010
闭嘴
Shut up.

380
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,040
叫上库萨帕里走吧
Let's just get koothrappali and go.

381
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,040
这小子真走运
Lucky bastard.

382
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,370
肯定是他口音的关系
It's got to be that stupid accent of his.

383
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,370
你好  我是孟买过来的桑贾伊
Hello. I am sanjay wolowitz from bombay.
