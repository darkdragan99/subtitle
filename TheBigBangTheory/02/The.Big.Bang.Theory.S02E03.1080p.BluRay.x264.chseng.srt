1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,270
亲爱的战友们
Fellow warriors,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,840
我是征服者谢耳朵
This is sheldor the conqueror.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,010
我们将要挺进阿克西多斯堡垒
We are about to enter axidus' fortress.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,540
这是一场持久战  请大家做好排尿工作
Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,510
好的  巴里  我们再等等你
All right, barry, we'll wait for you again,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,510
不过我建议你最好去看医生了
But you really  should see a doctor.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,270
谢耳朵暂时离开[网络用语]
Sheldor is afk.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,140
佩妮  你好像有什么困难的样子
Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,340
没错  我的门打不开了
Yes. I can't get  my stupid door open.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,940
你有没有意识到你是正在
You appear to have put  your car key

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,810
用车钥匙开这扇门？
In the door lock-- are you aware of that?

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,870
是的
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,370
那好吧
All right, then.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,540
妈的
Damn it,

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,370
妈的  妈的  妈的
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,740
你能尽量不出声吗
Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,840
这该死的钥匙拔不出来了
I can't get the damn key out.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,340
那是肯定的  你那扇门上的鲍尔温锁
Well, it's not surprising-- that baldwin lock on your door

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,970
用的是传统的边缘齿
Uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,670
而你那辆大众的钥匙
Whereas the key for your volkswagen

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,510
用的是中间齿系统
Uses a center cylinder system.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,570
谢谢你  谢尔顿
Thank you, sheldon.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,410
别客气
You're welcome.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,510
那你到底干嘛
Why did you put

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,310
要把汽车钥匙塞到门锁里去
Your car key in the door lock?

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,340
想知道为什么吗  我来告诉你  今天我有一次试镜
Why? I'll tell you why-- because today I had an audition,

27
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,810
我跑到那儿去花了两小时
It took me two hours  to get there,

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,110
然后又等了一小时才轮到我
I waited an hour for my turn,

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,270
而在我开始之前
And before I could even start,

30
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,870
他们却告诉我
They told me  I looked too midwest

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,370
我长得太中西部化了
For the part.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,370
太中西部化  这他妈的算什么意思
Too midwest-- what the hell  does that even mean?

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,340
在美国中西部定居的人们
Well, the american midwest was mostly settled

34
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,540
大多都是斯堪的纳维亚和日耳曼血统的
By scandinavian and germanic people.

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,270
他们脸部的毛发结构是很有特色的
They have a characteristic facial bone structure...

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,510
我知道这是什么意思  谢尔顿
I know what it means, sheldon!

37
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,410
上帝啊  我来洛杉矶已经快两年了
God! you know, I have been in l.a. for almost two years now,

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,670
还没演过一出戏
And I haven't gotten  a single acting job.

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,370
我什么事业都没完成
I've accomplished nothing, haven't gotten

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,840
工资也没涨  而且有六个月没做爱了
A raise at work, haven't   even had sex in six months,

41
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,210
就刚才  我在上楼梯的时候
And just now, when I was    walking up those stairs,

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,840
一只苍蝇飞进我嘴巴里  我居然把它吃下去了
A fly flew in my mouth  and I ate it!

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,070
实际上昆虫是很多国家餐桌上的必备
Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures.

44
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,640
差不多就可以把它们看作蛋白质
They're almost pure protein.

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,470
我草你娘的
Oh, son of a bitch!

46
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,810
我认为是的那些冷冻食物的融化
I believe the condensation on your frozen foods

47
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,470
削弱了你纸袋的强度
Weakened the structural integrity of the bag.

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,270
我们还是回到你那钥匙的问题上吧
But returning to your key conundrum,

49
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,810
你应该去叫一个锁匠
Perhaps you should call a locksmith

50
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,310
-来帮你开门  -我叫过了
And have him  open the door for you. I did.

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,570
他说他什么时候到就什么时候到
He said he'll get here   when he gets here.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,610
你是不是因为他给你重复而无意义的回答
And you're frustrated  because he phrased his reply

53
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,370
-而变得如此癫狂  -没有
In the form of a meaningless tautology? no!

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,640
我之所以这样是因为我的人生充满了失败
I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything

55
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,970
还有我嘴巴里有苍蝇味道
And my breath smells like fly.

56
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,110
不哭
There, there.

57
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,270
你想到我们的屋子里等吗
Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?

58
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,440
不  谢尔顿  我想坐在这冰冷的地板上
No, sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing-cold floor

59
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,910
像三岁小孩一样哭
Sobbing like a three-year-old.

60
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,810
那好吧
All right, then.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,970
看在上帝的份上
For heaven's sake.

62
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,510
我还当我掌握到挖苦的窍门了呢
Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,900
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第03集

64
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,860
你随便坐
Make yourself comfortable.

65
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,550
那里不行
Not there.

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,150
谢耳朵回来了
Sheldor is back online.

67
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,020
谢耳朵?
Sheldor?

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,350
征服者
The conqueror.

69
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,650
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

70
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,320
暂时离开
Afk.

71
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,320
我在玩科南时代  一个背景是
I'm playing age of conan,   an online multiplayer game

72
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,120
罗伯特·E·霍华德科南野蛮时代的网络游戏
Set in the universe of robert e. howard's conan the barbarian.

73
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,790
谢耳朵回来了
Sheldor back online.

74
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,120
什么是"afk"
What's "afk"?

75
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,850
Afk
Afk.

76
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,590
暂时离开一下键盘
Away from keyboard.

77
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,650
知晓了
Oh, I see.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,350
你那是代表什么意思
What does that stand for?

79
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,650
知晓了
Oh, I see.

80
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,350
我听见了  但那是代表什么
Yes, but what does it stand for?

81
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,050
点击那只魔化的靴子  就能穿上了
Now, just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,620
等等啊  我能换一种颜色吗
Mm, I don't know-- can I see them in another color?

83
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,690
点它就是了
Just click on them.

84
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,350
祝贺你 你现在是一个3级的战士了
Yeah, congratulations. You are now a level-three warrior.

85
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,690
-怎么回事  -莱纳德
What's going on? leonard,  guess what?

86
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,720
我是一个3级战士了
I'm a level-three warrior.

87
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,550
很好
Great.

88
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
你知道你门外东西掉了一地么
Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?

89
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,690
知道知道知道
Yeah, yeah, yeah. shh.

90
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,150
我只是想告诉你  你的冰淇淋已经融化了
I only bring it up because your ice cream's melting

91
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,350
而且招来了野生动物
And it's starting to attract wildlife.

92
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,690
知道了
Uh-huh, yeah.

93
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,520
我现在应该守在丛林里还是去海滩
Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?

94
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,790
无所谓  你现在的任务是找财宝
It doesn't matter-- right now; you're looking for treasure.

95
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,050
等等  你去哪儿
Wait, wait, where are you going?

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,790
不  不  没事
No, no. you're okay.

97
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,850
如果你碰到鳄鱼  就用靴子踢它
If you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,550
你能告诉我怎么了吗
You want to catch me up?

99
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,090
好吧
Well, let's see, uh,

100
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,920
她尝试用车钥匙来开门
She attempted to open her apartment with her car key

101
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,250
因为她的脸太中西部化了
Because her face is overly midwestern, um...

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,050
她六个月没做爱了
She hasn't had sex in six months...

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,820
还有她吃了一只苍蝇
And she ate a fly.

104
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,150
真的吗  六个月
Seriously?  six months?

105
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,490
天呐
Oh, my god!

106
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,090
一个财宝箱  我发财了
A treasure chest! I'm rich!

107
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,950
才3级就觉得自己发财了
Level three, and she thinks she's rich.

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,150
真是个新手
What a newb.

109
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,450
好了
Okay...

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,890
万事俱备
We're all set.

111
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,020
开始吧
Let her rip.

112
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,520
嗨
Hi.

113
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,150
快看  这只是玉米淀粉和水
Check it out-- it's just   corn starch and water.

114
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,050
它们组成
They make up

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,190
非牛顿流体  也就是液体
A non-newtonian fluid, which is liquid,

116
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,620
但是在音箱的冲击作用下呈现固态
But solid under the percussive action of the speaker.

117
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,690
知道它的魅力所在了吧
That's what makes it get all funky.

118
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,120
好吧
Yeah. okay.

119
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,720
听着  我要和谢尔顿说两句
Uh, listen, I need to talk to sheldon.

120
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,690
没有  她说的就是谢尔顿
No, that's what she said-- sheldon.

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,720
我在游戏里
Okay, I'm in the game,

122
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,790
我正在托泰吉岛探险
And I've been exploring the island of tortage,

123
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,850
但我不知道怎么通过船长护卫
But I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,190
你有魔剑么
Do you have the enchanted sword?

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
没有  我有个铜匕首
No, no, I have a bronze dagger.

126
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,020
你用铜匕首是打不过船长护卫的
You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger.

127
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,590
天呐  这跟你用车钥匙
My lord, it's like the car key

128
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,150
开公寓的门一个道理
In your apartment door all over again.

129
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,550
好吧  我怎么能得到那把剑
All right, how do I get the sword?

130
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,120
你有没有去过米希拉神庙
Well, have you been to the temple of mishra?

131
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,620
你是说山上那个
Is that the place on the hill with

132
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,550
-门前站着好多诡异的牧师  -不对不对
-The weird priest in front of it? -no, no, no, it's...

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,890
我的老天  还是给我吧
Oh, for god's sakes, gimme.

134
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,220
谢谢  感激不尽
Thank you-- I really appreciate this.

135
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,590
你必须学会
You're gonna have to learn

136
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,820
自己做这些事  佩妮
To do these things for yourself, penny.

137
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,390
别管我了  赶快给我把剑搞来
Don't patronize me-- just get the sword!

138
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,420
有没有搞错
What the frack?

139
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,250
我真晕
Beats me.

140
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,420
他们昨天玩了一晚上
They were playing all last night, too.

141
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,590
就像那种把两个不相干的人物扯到一起的恶搞动漫
It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.

142
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,950
就像绿巨人和薄荷佩蒂约会
Like if hulk were dating peppermint patty.

143
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,590
我一直以为薄荷佩蒂是蕾丝边呢
I always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian.

144
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,590
不  那是玛茜
No, that's marcie.

145
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,850
薄荷佩蒂只是比较运动型
Peppermint patty's just athletic.

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
好了  魔剑到手
There you go-- one enchanted sword.

147
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,850
好的  给我给我
All right, gimme, gimme, gimme.

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,750
看我把那个船长守卫杀了的
I want to kill the guard captain.

149
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,850
那个女孩真应该好好过日子
That girl needs to get a life.

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,730
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

151
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,460
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

152
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,090
危险警报
Danger! danger!

153
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,690
没事  是我佩妮
No danger--  it's just me, penny.

154
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,460
听着  我现在25级了
Listen, I got to level 25

155
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,290
然后到了紫莲花沼泽对吧
And reached purple lotus swamp, right?

156
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,560
你在我的卧室里
You're in my bedroom.

157
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,990
莱纳德给了我应急钥匙
Leonard gave me an emergency key.

158
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,330
我的卧室不许外人进的
People can't be in my bedroom.

159
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,430
那我们去客厅说吧
Well, can we go talk in the living room?

160
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,660
但我没有穿睡裤
I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

161
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,590
为什么
Why not?

162
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,430
我把葡萄汁洒上了
I spilled grape juice.

163
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,320
那就穿别的睡裤啊
Well, wear different pajamas.

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,090
我不能穿别的睡裤  这是我周一的睡裤
I can't wear different pajamas--  these are my monday pajamas.

165
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,910
佩妮  我的卧室不许外人进的
Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.

166
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,890
好吧  你就告诉我  现在就去 黑色城堡探险是不是早了点
Okay, fine, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the black castle?

167
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,010
-有人邀请你去黑色城堡探险么  -没错
-You were invited on a quest to the black castle? -yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,220
布达佩斯的几个人找我去的
By some guys in budapest.

169
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,190
我就是不太确定我的人物该不该去
I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.

170
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,220
当然不该  你才 25级
Of course it's not--   you're only a level 25.

171
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,260
这些匈牙利人 他们把你当龙的诱饵
These hungarians, they're just using you for dragon fodder.

172
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,220
真的么  我怎么就信了 那群匈牙利蛮夷的呢
Really? boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of hungarian barbarians.

173
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,500
拜托  佩妮  够了 我得睡觉了
Please, penny, enough. I have to sleep.

174
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,400
好吧  你真强 谢谢
Okay, well, you were great. Thanks.

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,790
莱纳德  不要进谢尔顿的房间 他没穿睡裤
Oh. hey, leonard. listen,  don't go in sheldon's room he's not wearing bottoms.

176
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,320
谢尔顿  你愿意再提示我一下么
Sheldon, you want  to catch me up again?

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,780
我今天很忙
People, I am very busy today.

178
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,280
我知道  盖博豪斯博士
I realize that, dr. gablehauser,

179
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,240
但作为系主任
But it is your job, as  head of the department,

180
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,420
协调不同院系的矛盾是你的工作
To mediate all interdepartmental disputes.

181
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,930
学校工作手册 第四章  第二节
University policy manual, chapter Four, Subsection Two:

182
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,810
"协调院系间的矛盾"
"mediation of interdepartmental disputes."

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
好吧
Fine.

184
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,010
温克尔博士
Dr. winkle, what colorful name

185
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,430
这次你又给库珀博士取什么外号了
Did you call dr. cooper this time?

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,180
傻蛋博士
Dr. dumb-ass.

187
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,240
库珀博士  温克尔博士道歉了
Dr. cooper, dr. winkle apologizes.

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,020
-不  我没有  -不  她没有
No, I don't. no, she doesn't.

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,440
问题是这样
Here's the problem.

190
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,310
我很明确地做了登记
I was clearly signed up

191
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,710
来使用博克曼实验室204室的主机
To use the mainframe in buckman 204,

192
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,410
而温克尔博士却粗暴地
And dr. winkle just wantonly

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
把它们都撕了下来
Ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.

194
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,980
那甚至都不是正式的登记表格
It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet.

195
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,680
他自己打印出来
He printed it himself, and he put his name down

196
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,210
在每一个机位都写上自己的名字  使用六个月
On every slot for the next six months.

197
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,250
如果保证学校的资源 不被浪费在
If it is a crime to ensure that the university's resources

198
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,240
追逐亚原子界的野鹅敢死队  是有罪的话
Are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese,

199
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,410
那么我承认我错了
Then I plead guilty.

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,800
-佩妮! -你要接那个电话么  库珀博士
-Oh, penny! -do you need To get that, dr. cooper?

201
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,580
-才不  -别关机啊
-God, no. -Well, don't turn it off,

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,040
你可能会错过诺贝尔委员会
You might miss your call from the nobel committee

203
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,340
提名你为年度荣誉傻蛋
Letting you know you've been nominated

204
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,640
的通知
As dumb-ass laureate of the year.

205
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,940
是么
Oh, yeah? well...

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,680
那你连提名都不会被提名
You wouldn't even be nominated.

207
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,680
盖博豪斯博士  我需要运行
Dr. gablehauser,  I have a series

208
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,610
一系列重要的模拟和计算
Of important calculations  and simulations to run.

209
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,210
而她只是简化一些毫无关系的数据
All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data

210
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
然后嘲笑
And making a mock...

211
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,810
抱歉
Excuse me.

212
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,360
盖博豪斯
Gablehauser.

213
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,320
打给你的
It's for you.

214
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,740
喂
Hello?

215
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,270
佩妮  现在不方便说话
Penny, this is not a good time.

216
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,330
不  我跟你说过 你还不能去焚灵圣殿
No, I told you, you're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls.

217
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,740
你得组个至少5人的队去
You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest

218
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,400
1个35级的医师
And one should be a level 35 healer.

219
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,850
佩妮  我不能上线帮你
Penny, I can't log on and help you.

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,590
等我回家再说
We'll talk when I get home.

221
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,080
我没沉迷网游  对吧
I'm not getting the computing time, am i?

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,040
傻蛋
Dumb-ass.

223
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,830
莱纳德  你得想办法解决佩妮
Leonard, you have to do something about penny.

224
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,290
她妨碍我睡觉
She is interfering with my sleep,

225
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,700
她妨碍我工作
She's interfering with my work,

226
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,470
我生活中要是还有其他重要面
And if I had another significant aspect of my life,

227
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,130
我肯定她也会参一脚
I'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too.

228
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,950
为什么要我想办法
Why should I do something?

229
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,480
-是你教她网游的  -没错
You're the one who introduced  her to online gaming. yes,

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,040
但她刚搬来时  是你去招惹她的
But you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in.

231
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,980
要是你当时克制自己
If you'd simply restrained yourself,

232
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,200
就不会发生这些事了
None of this would be happening.

233
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,130
干嘛不直接跟她说别烦你
Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?

234
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,860
我跟她说了
I did, I told her,

235
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,490
我发信息给她  我发了个斩钉截铁的Twitter邮件[即时信息]
I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter.

236
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,510
就连我的Facebook状态都改成
I even changed my facebook status to

237
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,770
希望佩妮勿扰的谢尔顿·库珀
"sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone."

238
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,870
我不知道还能怎么办
I don't know what else to do.

239
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,170
那我又能做什么
Well, what am I supposed to do?

240
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,130
我不知道  但如果你不想点主意
I don't know, but if you don't figure something out,

241
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,280
我警告你  我会变得相当难相处
I warn you, I shall become very difficult to live with.

242
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,700
你是说直到现在  我们都体验着
You mean up until now we've been experiencing

243
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,230
快乐  祥和的谢尔顿
The happy, fun-time Sheldon?

244
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,150
-没错  -我这就跟她谈
Yes. I'll go talk to her.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,980
不  德国佬  我要你帮我防侧面
No, fritz, I need you on my flank.

246
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,600
不  我不会说德语
No, I don't know german.

247
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,970
侧面  侧面[伪德语]
Flankenzei, flankenzei.

248
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,020
-佩妮  -忙呢
Hey, Penny.Busy.

249
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,150
我看到了
Yeah, I see that.

250
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,570
你不是要上班吗
Shouldn't you be at work?

251
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,640
我周一不上班
I don't work on mondays.

252
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,580
今天是周四
It's thursday.

253
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,590
这样的  佩妮
Listen, Penny...

254
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,700
珀涅罗珀女王[奥德赛的妻子]  暂时离开
Queen penelope, afk.

255
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,990
干嘛
What...?

256
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,220
是这样的
Here's the thing.

257
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,420
有时候  有些人  好人
Sometimes people, good people,

258
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,860
他们开始玩网游
Yeah, they start playing these games

259
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,540
然后发现自己
And they find themselves--

260
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,350
非自己过失  不知不觉地
Through no fault of their own--

261
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,460
有点  上瘾了
You know, kind of...addicted.

262
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,090
明白  我快升级了
Yeah, get to the point.I'm about to level up here.

263
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,990
只是如果一个人
It's just if a person doesn't have

264
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,790
在现实生活中缺乏成就感
A sense of achievement in their real life,

265
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,680
就很容易在虚拟世界迷失自我
It's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world

266
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,820
他们在那只能得到假的成就感
Where they can get a false sense of accomplishment.

267
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,260
对  唏哩哗啦  好了  小子们
Yeah, jabber, jabber, jabber.okay, boys,

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,550
珀涅罗珀女王归队了
Queen penelope's back online.

269
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,760
佩妮  你

270
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,060
头发上有奇多[一种零食]
Cheetos in your hair.

271
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,470
谢谢
Oh. thanks.

272
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,420
佩妮  又是我  莱纳德
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

273
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,250
莱纳德  我说了没时间
Leonard, I said not now.

274
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,430
我知道  我只是有点担心你
I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.

275
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,710
我说了没时间
I said not now!

276
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,210
好吧  以后说吧
Okay, maybe later.

277
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,770
伙计们
Hey, guys.

278
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,090
他怎么了
Hey, what's with him?

279
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,090
佩妮晚上一直烦他
Penny's been keeping him up at night.

280
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,390
我也是
Me, too.

281
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,670
但用另一种方式
But probably in a different way.

282
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,280
她迷上柯南时代
She's gotten really hooked on age of conan.

283
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,510
一直在玩  没停过
She's playing nonstop.

284
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,540
对  沉溺网游
Ah, yes, online gaming addiction.

285
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,750
没什么比
There's nothing worse than having

286
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,470
被多玩家高手追在后面更糟的
That multi-player monkey on your back.

287
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,120
谢尔顿  醒醒
Sheldon, wake up!

288
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,580
危险  危险
Danger! danger!

289
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,730
中午好  男士们
Afternoon, men.

290
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,240
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

291
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
行啊
Oh, yeah?

292
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,140
你想通过把我从成人男性里排除
Well, your attempt at juvenilizing me

293
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,480
抑制我成长  只是
By excluding me from the set of adult males, just...

294
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,030
我累得吵不出来了
Oh, I'm too tired to do this.

295
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,090
对  我听说你通宵和 中土大陆娃娃夜战
Right.I heard you've been pulling all-nighters with middle earth barbie.

296
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,430
她跑到我房间里
She comes into my room.

297
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,200
没人能随便进我房间
No one's supposed to be in my room.

298
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,310
我觉得她只是逃到网络世界
I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world

299
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,290
以弥补她的性挫折
To compensate for her sexual frustration.

300
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,370
我也是这样
I do that, too.

301
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,160
但用另一种方式
But probably in a different way.

302
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,820
不是这样的  莱斯利
That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

303
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,990
她只是想拾回她的自尊心
She's just trying to shore up her self-esteem.

304
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,220
跟性没关系
It has nothing to do with sex.

305
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,710
任何事物都和性有关
Everything has to do with sex.

306
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,000
正确
Mm, testify.

307
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,170
我不会碰它的
I'm not touching that.

308
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,510
莱斯利  你扯太远了
Leslie, you are way off base here.

309
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,940
等等  莱纳德 虽然我藐视莱斯利的科学家身份
Hang on, leonard. While I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist

310
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,620
或者做人这点
Or a human being,for that matter,

311
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,890
我们必须 承认她在滥交和随便的性爱领域中
We have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields

312
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,640
不可否认的经验
Of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

313
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,670
谢谢
Thank you.

314
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,780
我是说那个小叮当[小飞侠里面的小精灵]只是需要一点慰藉
My point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some.

315
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,250
一些什么 哦  知道了  一些性事
Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

316
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,580
我主动献身
I'll take the bullet.

317
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
不好意思  这主意太馊了
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.

318
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,710
别争了  我准备采取行动了
Enough debate, I'm going to take action.

319
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,180
打扰一下
Excuse me.

320
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,310
你目前有固定性关系吗
Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?

321
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,680
没有
No.

322
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,480
你想有吗
Would you like to be?

323
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,480
当然  何乐不为
Uh... sure, why not?

324
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,400
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

325
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,770
别  别  别
Puh-puh-puh.

326
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,810
能要你的电话号码吗
Can I have your phone number?

327
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,280
好的
Uh... yeah.

328
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,800
看  问题解决了
There. problem solved.

329
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,380
傻蛋
Dumb-ass.

330
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,120
我在古城瑰宝的大门外 我要进去了
Okay, I'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients. I'm going in.

331
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,380
-紧挨着墙走 躲开木乃伊  -明白
-Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies. -got it.

332
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,360
不得不说你仅23岁  就是个高手女性玩家
I must say you're playing very well for a woman of 23.

333
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,010
-22岁 好的  -22岁
-Twenty-two. -Right, 22.

334
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,080
[网络征友信息]

335
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,120
木乃伊过来了 我该用哪招  夺命拳 还是定身咒
Oh, here come the mummies. Which spell do I use, the hateful strike or the frenzy stance?

336
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,240
你团队中的其他人呢
What happened to the rest of your group?

337
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,210
我把他们甩了  他们是一帮衰人
I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.

338
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,840
定身咒
Frenzy stance.

339
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
定住  定住  定住  定住  定住
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy.

340
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,180
你能描述下你理想中的假期吗
So, listen, would you describe your ideal vacation

341
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,120
在不知名的小岛上野外探险 还是窝在家里捧本好书
As a wild adventure to unknown lands or staying at home curled up with a good book?

342
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,980
什么
What?

343
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,740
这些是市场调查问题
These are market research questions.

344

我在为你的游戏做在线注册
I'm filling out the online registration for your game.

345
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,680
好的  野外探险
Oh, okay, wild adventure.

346
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,640
定身咒不管用
Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.

347
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,700
死  你这不死的木乃伊  死
Die, you undead mummy, die!

348
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,230
服一剂疗伤药 -谢谢  -不客气
Drink a healing potion. Thank you. you're welcome.

349
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,640
从1到5五个等级 1是完全他主动
Anyhow, on a scale of one to five, with one being always initiated by him

350
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,980
5是完全你主动  你的性爱级别是几
And five being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?

351
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,780
注册需要写这个吗
That's on the registration?

352
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
是的  非常深入的调查

355

太棒了  我绝对喜欢主动  我铁定是5级
Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate. I'm a big ol' five.

356
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,910
知道了
Good to know.

357
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,280
铁定的5级
Big ol' five.

358
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,790
你好
Hello.

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,070
嗨
Hi.

360
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,160
莱纳德  这是汤姆
Leonard, this is tom.

361
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,310
嗨  汤姆  谢尔顿
Hi, tom.   sheldon...

362
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,160
难道我没告诉你 在自助餐厅里的小误会吗
Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?

363
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,690
说了 如饭桌上别的人一样 你表述得非常清楚
Yes, you were very clear. As was everyone else at the table.

364
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,220
不过汤姆是经过科学筛选出来
Tom, however, has been chosen by science

365
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,760
的适合佩妮的约会对象
As a suitable mate for penny.

366
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,360
科学筛选
Chosen by science?

367
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,390
通过交友网站的科学系统
Well, what passes for science on dating sites.

368
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,620
声称用了启发式算法 但估计是胡说八道
They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.

369
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,190
你让佩妮登记去网上交友
You got penny to sign up for online dating?

370
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,810
不是  当然不是 我欺骗使诈来着
No, of course not. See, I used trickery and deceit.

371
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,460
这下糟糕了
This is bad.

372
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,150
汤姆是消防队的护工
Tom is a paramedic with the fire department,

373
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,710
但他晚上去医学院上课
But he's going to med school at night.

374
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,080
他喜欢户外活动
He likes the outdoors

375
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,660
喜欢强悍在性上主动的女人
And, uh, strong women who initiate sex.

376
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,990
太  太糟了
Really, really bad.

377
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,460
我很奇怪你在佩妮那儿都没有上垒
I'm surprised you struck out with penny.

378
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
她可是超级5级型
Apparently, she's a big ol' five.

379
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,510
谢尔顿  你想干嘛
Sheldon, what do you want?

380
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,320
哦  不错 你收到我留言了 佩妮  我想让你见见汤姆
Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet tom.

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,910
佩妮  这是汤姆 汤姆  容我介绍佩妮
Penny, this is tom. Tom, may I present penny.

382
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,860
嗨  佩妮
Hi, penny.

383
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,790
恩  嗨  听着 只要我一上线
Yeah, hey. listen... As long as I'm here,

384
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,270
就被一群菜鸟包围着问问题 这些人根本找不着北
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs. They don't know what they're doing.

385
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,570
我们有一个刺客 三个使咒者  无战车
We've got one assassin, three spell casters and no tank.

386
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,720
-这个我们能玩点再谈吗 -不行 不行  我现在就需要你
-Can we talk about this later? -No, no, no, no. I need you now.

387
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,890
你难道不想和汤姆交往一下吗
Wouldn't you prefer to socialize with tom,

388
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,760
他是个性上被动  喜欢户外的人
Who is a sexually passive outdoorsman?

389
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,680
随便了  我自己想办法
Whatever. I'll figure it out myself.

390
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,830
再见  佩妮
Bye, penny.

391
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,230
不好意思  伙计  她和照片上简直是两个人
I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.

392
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,460
从来都是这样的
They never do

393
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,170
你好  美女佩妮
hello, fair penny.

394
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,450
你是谁
Who are you?

395
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,350
是我  霍华德·沃罗威茨先生
It is i, sir howard of wolowitz.

396
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,470
能邀请你去那边的虚拟酒馆喝上壶麦芽酒
Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing

397
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,990
在精神世界中畅游消磨下午时光吗
Followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?

398
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,700
好的  当然  干嘛不呢
Yeah, sure, why not?

399
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,140
天哪  救救我吧
Oh, my god, I need help.
