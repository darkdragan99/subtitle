1
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,560
早上好  莱纳德
Good morning,leonard.

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,160
我们开车去上班的路上
yeah.  we're gonna

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,130
要在陶瓷大库房[家居专卖店]停一下
Have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,660
我在那里买了星战床单
I bought these star wars sheets,

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,390
但躺在这上面实在是太刺激了
But they turned out to be much too stimulating

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,430
我根本不能安心睡着
To be compatible with a good night's sleep.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,830
黑武士盯着我看  我很不爽
I don't like the way darth vader stares at me.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,630
我不去上班了
I'm not going to work.

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,390
就算你的研究生涯这几年里毫无建树
Oh,just because your career's been stagnant

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,760
那也没必要放弃啊
For a few years,that's no reason to give up.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,030
谢尔顿  我整晚都没睡
Sheldon,i was up all night

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,860
我在用自由电子激光束
Using the new free-electron laser

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,090
做X射线散射实验
For x-ray diffraction experiment.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,090
是不是激光束碰巧把你视网膜烤焦了
Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,230
没
No.

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,730
那你就能开车了  快走
Then you can drive. let's go.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,790
我不是告诉你了么  我现在是晚上工作
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,590
你要另外想办法了
And that you'd have to make other arrangements?

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,290
是啊
You did.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,090
所以
And?

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,060
我没办法
I didn't.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,260
走吧
Let's go.

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,490
晚安  谢尔顿
Good night,sheldon.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,190
那我怎么去上班啊
But how am I going to get to work?

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,190
乘公交车
Take the bus.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,660
我再也不能乘公交车了
I can't take the bus anymore.

27
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,690
车上没安全带啊
They don't have seat belts,and they won't let you

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,230
而且他们不让我用橡皮绳子把自己拴在座椅上
Latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords.

29
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,960
你想用橡皮绳子把自己捆在座椅上
You tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords?

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,730
我不是想  我已经做到了
I didn't try. I succeeded.

31
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,930
但不知为什么  其他乘客对此很惊慌
But for some reason,it alarmed the other passengers

32
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,090
他们让我滚下车
And I was asked to de-bus.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,630
傻孩子
Oh,you're a big boy.

34
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,090
你会自己想出办法的
You'll figure it out.

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,030
别把我当孩子
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,330
你现在立刻带我去退掉星战床单
Now,take me to return  my star wars sheets!

37
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,530
佩妮
Penny?

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,290
佩妮  佩妮
Penny? penny?

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,690
谢尔顿  你搞什么
Sheldon. what is it?

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,560
莱纳德睡着了
Leonard's asleep.

41
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,260
谢谢你的最新更新
Thanks for the update.

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,460
别  等等
No. wait.

43
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,130
你一定要开车送我去上班
You have to drive me to work.

44
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,330
我看未必
Yeah,i really don't think I do.

45
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,260
但我不会开车  我也不想坐公交车
But I don't drive,and I can't take the bus.

46
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,990
只要你不用那橡皮绳
Honey,you'll be fe as long as you don't do

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,130
坐公交肯定没问题的
That bungee cord thing,okay?

48
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,960
佩妮
Penny.

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,660
你不是声称我们是朋友吗
Didn't you recently stated that you and I are friends?

50
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,760
是的  谢尔顿  我们是朋友
Yes,sheldon. we are friends.

51
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,630
所以说我在这儿是引用
Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand

52
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,560
我们隐含的友谊契约书中的一个重要部分
Is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship.

53
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,990
帮助
The favor.

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,430
上帝啊
Oh,dear god.

55
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,230
对不起  我不是故意
I'm sorry,i didn't realize

56
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,090
来打扰你做早晨祷告
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,330
你做完了我们就出发
When you're done,we'll go.

58
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,430
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第05集

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,420
谢谢你送我去上班
Thank you for driving me to work.

60
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,020
今天是我的休息日  谢尔顿
You know this is my day off,sheldon.

61
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,690
太好了  看来我没有耽误你什么事
Oh,good. I'm not keeping you from anything.

62
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,620
你的"检查引擎"灯亮着
Your "check engine" light is on.

63
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,820
一般来说  这算是提醒你
Typically that's an indicator

64
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,490
去检查引擎
To,you know,check your engine.

65
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,450
没什么事  这灯亮了一个月了
It's fine. it's been on for,like,a month.

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,090
这样说来的话  那你就有更多的理由去
Well,actually,that would be all the more reason to...

67
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,590
检查引擎了
You know,check your engine.

68
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,420
谢尔顿  我的车没事
Sheldon,it's fine.

69
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,490
如果没事的话
If it were fine,

70
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,820
那这灯就不会亮了
The light wouldn't be on.

71
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,890
制造商装了这个灯
That's why the manufacturer installed that light,

72
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,920
就是为了告诉你有问题
To let you know it's not fine.

73
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,820
大概是这灯坏了
Maybe the light's broken.

74
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,820
有没有检查"检查引擎灯"的灯
Is there a "check the 'check engine light' light"?

75
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,450
干嘛
What?

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,390
试验表明  在开车的时候
Studies have shown that performing tasks

77
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,250
某些行为  诸如吃东西  打电话
Such as eating,talking on a cell phone

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,890
或者喝咖啡
Or drinking coffee while driving

79
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,390
会降低人的反应速度
Reduces one's reaction time

80
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,490
就跟喝了一盎司酒精一样
By the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.

81
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,350
你带酒了吗
Do you have any alcohol?

82
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,190
当然没有
Of course not.

83
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,590
可惜了
Too bad.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,400
你要走欧几里德大道吗
You're going up euclid avenue?

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,030
莱纳德是从洛斯罗布斯大道开的
Leonard takes los robles avenu

86
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,230
随便他
Well,good for leonard.

87
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,060
欧几里德大道是直线距离  的确更近
Euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies,

88
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,030
但是这里有减速坡  会极大地降低
But it has speed bumps,which appreciably increase

89
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,430
点到点的行驶速度
Point-to-point drive time,

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,760
所以走这条路实际上更慢
Making It the less efficient choice.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
但是方向盘是在你手里
But you have the conn.

92
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,230
当然了  如果你在过减速坡的时候
Of course,if you're not going to slow down

93
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
不减速的话
For the speed bumps,

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
那我就收回之前的意见
I withdraw my previous objection.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,930
我有一个有趣的问题
Here's a fun question.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,460
你知道最常见的街道名字是什么吗
Do you know what the most common street name is?

97
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,430
不知道
No.

98
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,230
是个脑筋急转弯
The answer's tricky.

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,560
二街
It's second street.

100
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,630
你可能认为该是"一街"
You see,you'd think it would be first street,

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,230
但大多数地方
But in most towns,first street eventually

102
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
一街都用一些别的名字代替
Gets renamed to something else.

103
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,760
比如  主路
You know,like main street,

104
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,430
大街
Broad street.

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,430
密歇根大道[为1893年哥伦比亚博览会修建]
Michigan avenue.

106
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,460
莱纳德和我在路上经常找一些
See,leonard and I   often use our commute time

107
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,060
像这样的脑筋急转弯来锻炼大脑
To exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that.

108
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,900
我们也玩游戏
We also play games.

109
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,330
想玩么
Would you like to play one?

110
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,730
不
No.

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,900
来吧  可好玩了
Oh,come on. it's fun.

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,230
噢  又一个减速坡
Ooh! another bump.

113
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,900
这样吧  我说一个元素名称
Okay. I'll say an element,and,and you say an element

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,360
你也说一个
Whose name starts with the last letter

115
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,800
以我说的元素的尾字母开头
Of the one I said,okay?

116
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,730
从我开始
I'll start.

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,260
氦[Helium]
Helium.

118
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,460
你可以说汞[Mercury]
Now,you could say "mercury."

119
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,230
你给我一个"y"
That would give me a "y."

120
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,960
非常聪明  这个可不容易
Ooh. very clever.   that's a tough one.

121
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,260
镱[ytterbium]  让你又回到了"m"
So I go with "ytterbium," which gets you back to "m."

122
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,360
你可以说钼[molybdenum]  我说镁[magnesium]
So you go "molybdenum," and I say "magnesium."

123
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,660
你可以说锰[manganese]  我说铕[europium]
You say "manganese." I say "europium,"

124
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,730
现在你只剩下钔了[mendelevium]
And,then,you're left with "mendelevium,"

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,730
然后就没有以"m"开头的了
And... there are   no more m's

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,930
因为我相信[meitnerium]
Because I believe that meitnerium

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
应该被叫做ekairidium[一种过渡元素]
Should still be called ekairidium.

128
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,260
恭喜你  你赢了
So,congratulations. you win.

129
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,460
想再来一局么
Do you wanna go again?

130
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,500
我们就不能安静一会儿么
Why don't we just have a little quiet time now?

131
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,200
没问题
All right.

132
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,130
我觉得你对于引擎检查提示灯的
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance

134
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,930
冷漠鲁莽非常糟糕
Regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.

135
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,130
下车
Get out.

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
我不得不说
Well,i ve to tell you

137
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,200
关于内燃机引擎工作的原理
That while I do have a theoretical understanding

138
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,000
我是有一定了解的
Of the workings of an internal combustion engine,

139
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,860
不过我不确定能不能看出毛病在哪
I'm not sure I'm capable  of performing diagnostics.

140
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,860
我说了  下车
I said,"get out."

141
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,860
好吧  我就去试试好了
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

142
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,680
莱纳德  你在这儿呢
Oh,leonard. there you are.

143
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,590
我准备好回家了
I'm ready to go home.

144
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,560
我才刚到这
T1  I just got here.

145
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,760
真及时
Good. perfect timing.

146
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,860
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

147
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,260
我告诉过你啦  我只有晚上
Told you,i only have access

148
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,660
使用自由电子激光器的权限
To the free-electron laser at night.

149
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
这几个星期我都不能开车送你
I can't drive you for the next few weeks.

150
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,590
不对  你是说过你不能开车送我上班
No,you said you couldn't drive me to work.

151
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,220
但现在说的是下班
this is from work.

152
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,560
霍华德帮我说句话啊
Howard,help me out here.

153
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,590
不  我要站在他那边  这样有意思多了
No,just for the fun of it,i'm gonna take his side.

154
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,220
那么
Now,

155
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,760
你觉得我该怎么回家
How do you propose I get home?

156
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,990
你是怎么来的呢
How did you get here in the first place?

157
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,290
佩妮
Penny.

158
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,760
但我觉得这个选项已经没可能了
But I sense that's no longer an option.

159
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,390
反正我要用激光实验室
Look,i need to get edto the laser lab.

160
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,620
你只能找别人
You're just gonna have

161
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,920
送你回家了
To find someone else to take you home.

162
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,390
该死  我站错队了
Ah,damn,i picked the wrong side.

163
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,360
老天  不要走欧几里德大道吧
Oh,god,not euclid avenue!

164
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,190
到底为什么霍华德把你
Why did howard leave you

165
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,620
扔在半道上
In the middle of the road anyway?

166
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,520
我们观点不统一
We had a difference of opinion.

167
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,860
什么观点
Over what?

168
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,860
关于他是不是要害死我
Whether or not he was trying to kill me.

169
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,190
事实可鉴  我坚持他就是
For the record,i maintain he was.

170
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,820
你要去哪
Where are you going?

171
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,120
带你回家啊
I'm taking you home.

172
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,390
但我先不回家的
Oh,but I'm not going home.

173
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,490
今天礼拜三
It's wednesday.

174
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,620
礼拜三是漫画书购买日
Wednesday's new comic book day.

175
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,320
我们必须先去动漫书店
We have to go to the comic book store.

176
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,260
之后  我们在种汤小吃店停下
And then,we have to stop

177
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,460
因为今天还是奶油土豆汤日
At soup plantation; it's creamy tomato soup day.

178
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
最后是雷都夏克电器行
And radio shack.

179
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,960
今天有个3A电池的折扣
There's a sale on triple-a batteries.

180
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,590
对了还有  我们还得去下陶瓷大库房
Plus,we have to go to pottery barn

181
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,990
我要把我的星战床单退了
And return my star wars sheets.

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,160
我有个更好的主意
I have a better idea.

183
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,720
你想先去陶瓷大库房啊
You want to go to pottery barn first?

184
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,620
你能开车送我去陶瓷大库房吗
Can you drive me to pottery barn?

185
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,420
如果我把夜明灯关了
Maybe if I turn off the night-light,

186
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,120
这床单还能用
I can keep the sheets.

187
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,120
早上好
Good morning.

188
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,990
早上好
Good morning.

谢尔顿  坐下
Sheldon,sit down.

190
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,720
她坐了我的位置
She's in my spot.

191
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,420
别那么看着我
Don't look at me like that.

192
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,790
谁都知道那是我的位置
Everybody knows that my spot.

193
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,690
谢尔顿  你知道我们都很关心你
Sheldon,you know  that we care about you.

194
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,620
就是因为我们关心你
And it's because we care about you

195
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,920
才不得不说
That we've decided we have to speak up.

196
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,960
亲爱的  你让你身边的人都头疼了
You're hurting the people around you,sweetie.

197

我们帮你做了个预约
So we made you an appointment,

198
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,790
想让你接受
And we want you to keep it.

199
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,820
机动车辆管理局新司机手册
Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook?

200
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,160
但我没有什么需要查的
But I don't have a problem.

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,390
谢尔顿  你得学会开车
Sheldon,you need to learn how to drive.

202
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,890
不能再这样疯下去了
This madness has to stop.

203
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,860
佩妮带你去车管局
Penny's taking you to the dmv.

204
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,690
我去睡觉
I'm going to bed.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,860
为什么是佩妮
Why penny?

206
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
因为石头赢过剪子[石头剪子布游戏]
Because rock breaks scissors.

207
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,360
晚安
Good night.

208
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,290
好了  走吧  谢尔顿
All right,come on,sheldon.

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,490
等下
Hold on.

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,860
我有个条件
I have one condition.

211
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
什么
What?

212
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,860
得去趟陶瓷大库房
We have to stop at pottery barn.

213
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,460
好的
Okay.

214
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,860
还有雷都夏克电器行
And radio shack.

215
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,520
行
Fine.

216

可以
All right!

218
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,590
我想去动漫书店
Ooh,i want to go to the comic book store.

219
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,610
我也喜欢漫画书
I like comic books.

220
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,490
我只是不明白我为什么需要驾驶执照
I just don't see why I need a driver's license.

221
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦从没有过驾驶执照
Albert einstein never had a driver's license.

222
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,720
是啊  但阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦从不在每小时
Yeah,but albert einstein didn't make me wet myself

223
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,220
40英里时让我惊出一身冷汗
At 40 miles an hour.

224
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,460
我也从不会把阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦疯狂地赶下车
Yeah,and I never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts.

225
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,760
我想问问  你为什么不和别人一样
You know,i gotta ask,why didn't you just

226
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,090
在16岁的时候考取驾照
Get a license at 16 like everybody else?

227
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,990
我在忙别的事
I was otherwise engaged.

228
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,520
做什么
Doing what?

229
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,160
验证超对称理论中n=4的情况下
Examining perturbative amplitudes

230
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,060
的扰动振幅
In n=4 supersymmetric theories

231
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,560
再用现代扭量理论重新验证
Leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties

232
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,220
n=8时回路超引力场的紫外特性
Of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.

233
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,190
那你17岁的时候呢
Well,how 'bout when you were 17?

234
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,720
带这个去测试区
Take this to the testing area,

235
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,290
在上面写上名字  下面签字
Put your name at the top,sign the bottom,

236
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,720
回答完问题交回来  下一个
Answer the questions,bring it back. next

237
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,160
申请
Application?

238
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,410
我实际上更多是理论家
I'm actually more of a theorist.

239
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,910
是说你手里的申请表
The application in your hand.

240
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,940
给她
Give it to her.

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,210
带这个去测试区
Take this to the testing area,

242
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,540
在上面写上名字  下面签字
Put your name at the top,sign the bottom,

243
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,610
回答完问题交回来  下一个
Answer the questions,bring it back. next!

244
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
抱歉  对这些问题我有些疑问
Excuse me,but I have some concerns about these questions.

245
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,580
看看那的标志牌
Look at that sign up there.

246
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,210
怎么了
Yes?

247
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,510
上面写了"我在乎"吗
Does it say "i give a damn"?

248
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,740
没
No.

249
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,710
那是因为我不在乎
That's because I don't.

250
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,180
就看一眼
Just look.

251
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,910
第一个问题就说不通
See,this first question makes no sense.

252
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,940
"当开车时与前车
"how many car lengths

253
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,840
的车距应该保持几个车身"
Should you leave in front of you when driving?"

254
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,080
没有可能能回答这个问题
There's no possible way to answer that.

255
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,810
"车身长"不是个标准化的度量单位
A "car length" is not a standardized unit of measure.

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,480
看看标志牌
Look at the sign.

257
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,910
谢尔顿  答案是"C"  就写"C"
Sheldon,it's "c." just put down "c."

258
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,110
我不需要你的帮忙  佩妮
I don't need yourelp,penny.

259
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,440
听那个小姑娘的  宝贝
Listen to that little girl,honey.

260
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,010
写上"C"  下一个
Put "c." next!

261
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,310
别  等下  等等
No,wait! no,hang on.

262
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,480
看看下一个问题
Look at this next question.

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,840
谢尔顿  你为何要和车管局争执
Sheldon,why are you arguing with the dmv?

264
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,780
否则他们怎么进步
How else are they going to learn?

265
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,810
听着
Look...

266
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,840
"什么时候路面最湿滑"
"when are roadways most slippery?"

267
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,180
有三个答案
Now,okay,there are three answers,

268
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,310
没一个是正确的
None of which are correct.

269
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,380
正确的答案是"当[路面]被覆盖上
The correct answer is "when covered by

270
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,940
一层液体足以
"a film of liquid sufficient to reduce

271
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,380
把轮胎和道路之间的静态摩擦系数
"the coefficient of static friction

272
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
减少到理论上的零值
"between the tire and the road to essentially zero,

273
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,380
又不产生新的摩擦源"
But not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."

274
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,640
这是你的学习证明  走开
Here's your learner's permit. go away.

275
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,740
但我还没说完
But I'm not done.

276
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,280
我还有更多的
I have many additial concerns

277
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,680
关于这些问题的质疑
About these questions.

278
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,780
别逼我翻过这柜台
Don't make me climb over this counter.

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,780
来吧  我们走  来吧
Come on. let's go. come on.

一流
Aced it.

282

好了  弄好了
Okay,that's it.

283
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,380
开始启动吧
Let's boot it up.

284
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,780
启动
Booting.

285
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,440
这是最先进的模拟器
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

286
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,580
我从一个朋友为军队
I adapted it from something

287
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,180
设计的东西上改装而来的
A friend of mine designed for the army.

288
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,310
所以我才在费鲁杰的市区里
Is that why I appear to be in downtown fallujah

289
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,040
跟在一辆装甲悍马的轮子后
Behind the wheel of an up-armored humvee?

290
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,040
我还没有配置呢
I haven't configured it yet.

291
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,310
看看
Let's see...

292
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,940
布拉德利坦克

293
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,010
运输卡车  蝙蝠车
Transport truck...  batmobile...

294
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,710
不行
Ooh! no.

295
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,210
就这个  2006款红色福特金牛座
Here we go. red 2006 ford taurus

296
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,180
驰骋在帕萨迪纳市的街道上
On the streets of pasadena.

297
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,210
怎么了
What?

298
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,240
据统计  红色车让警察叫停的次数
Statistically,red cars are stopped by police

299
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,940
比其它颜色的车多得多
Far more often than any other color.

300
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,910
我可不想跟条子发生口角
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

301
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,780
好吧  你想要什么颜色
Fine,what color do you want?

302
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,880
你知道天行者卢克那把淡蓝色的激光剑吗
You know the pale blue of luke skywalker's lightsaber?

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
当然不是后来的那个数码修复版里那种
Before it was digitally remastered?

304
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,310
就是黑色了
Black,it is.

305
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,540
好的  现在你首先要做的是
Okay,now,what you want to do first

306
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,810
打开点火开关
Is turn on the ignition

307
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,210
换到前进档
And shift into drive.

308
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,410
我还没系安全带呢
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

309
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,580
好吧  系上你的安全带
Okay,fasten your seat belt.

310
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
可以了
Click

311
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,310
这有安全气囊吗
Now,are there air bags?

312
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,910
你不需要安全气囊
You don't need air bags.

313
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,510
要是哪个模拟货车和我追尾了  怎么办
What if a simulated van  rear-ends me?

314
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,840
那我就用枕头给你脸一下
I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.

315
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,010
好的  换到前进档
Okay,now shift into drive.

316
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,210
慢慢开进车道
Pull out slowly into traffic.

317
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,840
小心  看着行人
Watch out,watch,watch out for the pedestrians!

318
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,340
天呢
Oh,god.

319
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,940
等等  慢点
Wait-- slow--

320
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,410
刹车  刹车
Hit the brakes! the brakes!

321
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,140
谢了
Thank you.

322
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,660
对不起
Sorry.

323
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
抱歉
Excuse me.

324
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,820
我的错
My bad.

325
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,190
新手上路
Student driver.

326
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,190
你怎么
How did you manage

327
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,160
开到幽谷拱廊商场[洛城顶级六大室内商场之一]的二层楼上了
To get on the second floor of the glendale galleria?

328
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,560
我不知道
I don't know.

329
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,890
我原来在帕萨迪纳市的高速公路  出口处没出去
I was on the pasadena freeway. I missed my exit,

330
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
冲出了天桥  之后就这样了
Flew off the overpass,and one thing led to another.

331
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,960
也许你该休息一下  明天再练
Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.

332
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,890
不用了  我不练了
No. I quit.

333
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,490
宠物商店
Aw,the pet store.

334
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,460
帮我谢谢沃罗威茨的软件
Remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software.

335
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,360
里面内容非常详尽
It's amazingly detailed.

336
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,120
那你就这样放弃了吗
Th  so wait,you're just gonna give up?

337
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,020
不是  我没放弃
No,i'm not giving up.

338
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,060
我从不放弃
I never give up.

339
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,390
那你在干嘛
So,what is it you're doing?

340
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,420
我就是
I'm...

341
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,460
情况非常的好
Transcending the situation.

342
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,920
很明显  我已经进化到不需要开车了
I'm clearly too evolved for driving.

343
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,720
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

344
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,120
莱纳德  你有没有想过  平均来说  为什么我的小趾
Leonard,have you ever wondered why my little toes

345
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,160
和侧门牙明显比像我这种身材的人
And lateral incisors are significantly smaller

346
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,190
的小趾和侧门牙要小
Than the average for someone of my size?

347
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,020
你的事  我有很多都很好奇  谢尔顿
I wonder a lot of things about you,sheldon.

348
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,460
不过没有这件
But not-not that.

349
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,460
这表明
Well,those are indicators

350
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,590
在进化系谱中  我比一般人
That I'm farther along the evolutionary scale

351
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,760
进化得更为充分
Than the average human.

352
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,490
-真有你的  -别走  别走
- No kidding. - well,no,no.

353
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,190
我这么说  并不意味着
I'm not gonna go so far as to say

354
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,920
我代表人类进化的新的高度
That I represent a distinct new stage in humankind--

355
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,960
新贵[出身低微而奋斗成功的人]  如果这是你想说的
You know,a homo novus,if you will.

356
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,690
不行  这得由人类学家决定
No,that's for anthropologists to decide.

357
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,620
但我确信
But I am convinced

358
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,660
我之所以不能掌握开车这种小技巧
That the rson I cannot master the plebeian task of driving

359
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
是因为我根本不想学
Is because I'm not meant to.

360
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,290
你想  你想的
Yes,you are.

361
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,590
你想去学车的
You're meant to learn how to drive.

362
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,360
求你了  学开车吧
Please learn how to drive!

363
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,820
不行  不行
No,no.

364
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,490
莱纳德  我是要去干大事业的
Leonard,i'm meant for greater things,

365
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,760
比如解开宇宙之谜
Like unraveling the mysteries of the universe,

366
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,360
而不是决定什么时候
Not determining when it's safe

367
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,660
在乡村公路上超过停在路边的校车是安全的
To pass a stopped school bus on a country road.

368
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,260
就没安全的时候
It's never safe.

369
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,390
我现在知道了
Yeah,well,i know that now.

370
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,220
好吧
Fine.

371
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,320
就算你说的全对
Assuming that everything you say is true,

372
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,720
那个生物学上的超级新贵
How does the biologically superior homo novus

373
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,160
明早怎么去上班
Get to work tomorrow morning?

374
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,220
新贵也不知道
Homo novus doesn't know.

375
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,690
坚持住
Well,hang in there.

376
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,590
也许你还能进化出翅膀之类的东西
Maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.

377
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,290
早安  先生们
Good morning,gentlemen.

378
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,060
早安
Hey. good morning.

379
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
这是不是什么新的星期五便装日
Is there some new kind of casual friday

380
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,020
而我不知道
I don't know about?

381
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,220
不是  他在这安家了
No,he lives here now.

382
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,720
真的吗  为啥
Really? why?

383
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,220
因为他不乘公交  而且进化得连车都开不了了
Since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive,

384
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,660
所以决定  在我完成我的实验前
He decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office

385
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,060
在他办公室睡觉  在放射室洗澡
And shower in the radiation lab

386
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,960
可能更好
Until I'm finished with my experiment.

387
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,690
不过你一周前不就完成了吗
But you finished your experiment a week ago.

388
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,690
没错
Yep

389
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,860
天呢
Ay,dios mio.

390
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,520
又来了
Tra vez?

391
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,260
肯定是老鼠
Deben ser rata

392
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,060
老鼠不会烤面包
Las ratas no hacen pan tostado

393
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,260
还把面包皮切开
Y le cortan las orillas.

394
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,060
妈呀
Ay,dios mio!

395
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,990
就当什么都没看见
You saw nothing!
