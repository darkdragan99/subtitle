1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,660
看啊  开始放《土星3号》了
Oh, look,  <i>Saturn 3</i> is on.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,750
我不想看《土星3号》
I don't want to watch  <i>Saturn 3.</i>

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,150
《深空9号》比这好多了
<i>Deep Space Nine</i> is better.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,920
《深空9号》怎么可能比得过《土星三号》
How is <i>Deep Space Nine</i> better than <i>Saturn 3?</i>

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,680
你算一算就知道9比3大6
Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,580
折衷一下吧 看《巴比伦5号》
Compromise. Watch <i>Babylon 5.</i>

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,650
你凭什么认为这是折衷的办法
In what sense is that a compromise?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,350
5是在3和...  当我没说
Well, five is partway between three... Never mind.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,480
不如这样吧
I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,180
我们石头剪刀布决定
How about we go rock-paper-scissors?

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,420
我看这样不行
Ooh, I don't think so.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,250
大量的实例研究表明
Anecdotal evidence suggests

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,850
在石头剪刀布中
that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,220
如果让互相熟悉的玩家进行一定局数的游戏
players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,650
那么其中有百分之75到80是打平的
due to the limited number of outcomes.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,020
我推荐玩石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克[星际旅行3里的人物]
I suggest rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,650
什么
What?

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,450
非常简单的
It's very simple.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,020
剪刀剪布  布包石头
Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,380
石头砸死蜥蜴
Rock crushes lizard.

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,650
蜥蜴毒死史波克
Lizard poisons Spock.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,550
史波克踩碎剪刀  剪刀将蜥蜴斩首
Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,080
蜥蜴吃掉纸[同义布]  论文[同义布]证明史波克不存在
Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock.

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,820
史波克把石头融化
Spock vaporizes rock.

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,980
最后和以前一样  石头敲坏剪刀
And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,620
好  我明白了
Okay, I think I got it.

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,620
石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克
Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,050
孩子们好
Hello, boys.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,950
这位兄台好
Ahoy, matey.

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,080
注意到我的眼罩了是吗
Noticed the eye patch, did you?

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,180
这是一个我最近正在研究的
It's all part of a technique I've been studying

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,780
勾搭女人的新技术
for picking up women.

33
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,580
只需使用一个显示屏
You employ a visual display

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,420
就可以为你设计出一套
designed to make yourself

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,420
与众不同夺人眼球的造型
distinctive and memorable.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,050
是啊  就像是雄孔雀那漂亮的羽毛
Oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,650
或者像发情的狒狒那饱满的臀部
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,480
或者就像是得了红眼病的犹太小男孩
Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

39
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,180
随便你怎么笑我  但这真招的很有用
Mock me if you will, but it works.

40
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,250
你可以穿着奇装异服进入一个派对
You show up at a club in something distinctive,

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,980
搜索目标  然后向她发起消极攻势
scope out your target and toss out some negs.

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,980
什么是消极攻势
What are negs?

43
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,450
消极攻势就是给她一些消极的评价
A neg is a negative compliment

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,420
好让她不要凌驾于你之上
that throws a pretty woman off her game,

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,820
举个例子  一般我对大牙齿很没爱
like "Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,650
但在你嘴里就显得很可爱
but on you, they work."

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,780
这样的台词我有一箩筐  谁想做我的泡妞搭档
I got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?

48
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,120
你不需要搭档
You're not gonna need wingman.

49
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,980
我看你是需要去看病
You're gonna need a paramedic.

50
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,920
霍华德  你的小摩托挡住我的车了
Howard, your scooter's blocking my car.

51
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,820
啊呀  你又得红眼病了?
Aw, did you get pinkeye again?

52
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,780
首先  她注意到我的眼罩了
Step one: she notices the eye patch.

53
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,150
恕我直言  佩妮
May I say, Penny,

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,120
一般头发如此恶心的女人们
not a lot of women could look as hot as you do

55
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,280
是没你这么漂亮的
with such greasy hair?

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,250
快去把你那辆破摩托挪开
Yeah, just move your stupid scooter

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,620
否则我就去把它扔进垃圾箱
before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,650
疼
Ow.

59
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第08集

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,720
不好意思  在我还没看《克隆战争》这部电影之前
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch <i>The Clone Wars</i> TV series

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,950
我是不会去看《克隆战争》的电视剧的
until I've seen  <i>The e Clone Wars</i> movie.

62
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,780
我想根据乔治·卢卡斯拍片的顺序
I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me

63
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,450
来欣赏他的烂作
in the order he intended.

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
但我现在就想看这个
Well, I want to watch it now.

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,280
那我认为我们又迎来了一个典型的
Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,520
石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克游戏时刻
rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,850
随便你看什么
Watch whatever you want.

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,050
你有一套啊
I saw what you did there.

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,580
怎么说
What'd I do?

70
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,620
喂  霍华德
Hello. Hey, Howard.

71
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,850
怎么了
What's wrong?

72
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,150
好好  我们马上就来
Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,320
什么事
What happened?

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
霍华德说他在火星漫步者实验室  碰到了点麻烦
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble.

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,450
安全等级5
Defcon 5.

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,920
安全等级5?
Defcon 5?

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,520
那就没必要这么急了
Well, there's no need to rush.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,680
什么
What?

79
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,320
等级5是和平时期的协议  没危险
Defcon 5 means "no danger."

80
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,520
等级1才是紧急情况
Defcon 1 is a crisis.

81
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,680
5怎么可能没1差
How can 5 not be worse than 1?

82
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,420
就是啊  《星际旅行5》   比1差
Yeah, <i>Star Trek V</i> worse than <i>I.</i>

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,020
首先  你比较的是质量
Okay, first of all, that's a comparison of quality,

84
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,380
而不是紧急程度
not intensity.

85
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,850
第二  《星际旅行1》和《星际旅行5》相比
Secondly, <i>Star Trek I</i> is orders-of-magnitude worse

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,550
简直就是老鼠比大象
than <i>Star Trek V.</i>

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,980
你在开什么玩笑  《星际旅行5》已经成为
Are you joking?  <i>Star Trek V</i> is the standard

88
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,020
劣质品测量的标杆
against which all badness is measured.

89
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,180
不  不
No, no.

90
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,720
《星际旅行5》差就差在
<i>Star Trek V</i> has specific failures

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,980
编剧和导演
in writing and direction,

92
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,650
而《星际旅行1》完全就是一无是处
while <i>Star Trek I</i> fails across the board:

93
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,450
艺术指导  服装  音乐  音响效果
art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,780
就当我没说什么安全等级好吗  我们快走
Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?

95
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,250
《星际旅行5》
<i>Star Trek V.</i>

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,180
至少你也应该承认
All right, will you at least stipulate

97
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,250
《星际旅行4：抢救未来》毫无疑问是最好的吧
that <i>Star Trek IV:</i>  <i>The Voyage Home</i> is inarguably the best?

98
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,450
我给你5个字
I have three words for you:

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,950
《天汗的愤怒》[星际之旅2]
<i>Wrath of Khan.</i>

100
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,950
感谢上帝你们来了
Oh, thank God, you're here.

101
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,180
有什么急事
What's the emergency?

102
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,450
火星漫步者被卡在沟里了
I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.

103
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,580
哪里
Where?

104
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,750
贝克斯菲尔德城外一条人迹罕至的公路
On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield.

105
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,650
要不然还能在哪  当然是火星!
Where do you think? On Mars!

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,350
霍华德  出什么事了
Howard, is everything okay?

107
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,850
宝贝  我马上进去
Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

108
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,010
你把一个姑娘带到火星探测器的控制室?
You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,350
我在一个酒吧碰到她的  她是个医生
Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor.

110
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,180
只要一剂免费的钡剂[灌肠用]
One free barium enema,

111
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,550
我妈根本不会在乎她是不是犹太人
and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.

112
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,680
等一下
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,650
那么说眼罩及人格侮辱这招管用了?
So the eye patch and e insults worked?

114
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,010
不  那里还有三个人也带着眼罩
No, there were three other guys with eye patches.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,310
彻底的失败
It was a fiasco.

116
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,380
管用的是这句话:
What did work was, "How'd you like to visit

117
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,810
"愿不愿意去个秘密政府部门看看?"
a secret government facility?"

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,980
那你要我们现在做什么呢
So what exactly do you want us to do?

119
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,210
你和拉杰帮我把火星探测器从沟里拖出来
I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch

120
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,510
而你要在任何人发现斯蒂芬妮之前
and I need you to get Stephanie out

121
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
帮我把她带走
before somebody notices she's here.

122
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,150
实际上我偷偷带她进来的
She doesn't exactly have clearance.

123
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,880
真的么?  难道他们不让从下等酒馆来的
Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in

124
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,110
陌生女人来玩在遥远星球上
and play with $200 million government projects

125
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,310
2亿美金的政府项目么?
on distant planets?

126
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,980
我知道我很坏  她可能给我一巴掌
Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me.

127
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,510
我们能回到问题上来了么?
Can we please move on?

128
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,710
霍华德  时间不早了
Hey, Howard, you know, it's getting late,

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,880
我到底还开不开得上车?
so do I get to drive this thing or what?

130
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,750
对不起  出了点紧急情况
Yeah. No. I'm sorry, but something's come up.

131
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,750
我是说火星漫步者  火星漫步者
Kind of a Mars Rover... Mars Rover

132
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,110
呼叫霍华德
can Howard come over...

133
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,980
的状况
situation.

134
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,650
我朋友莱纳德会带你回家的
So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.

135
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,310
走吧  好朋友莱纳德
Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.

136
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,350
回头打电话给你
I'll call ya.

137
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,410
你也是像霍华德一样的科学家么?
Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?

138
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,810
没有科学家像霍华德那样
No one's a scientist like Howard.

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,980
我妈肯定会很喜欢她
My mother is so gonna love her.

140
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,650
多好啊  没准她们可以一起搭车
How nice. Maybe they can carpool

141
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,250
去联邦监狱看你
when they visit you in federal prison.

142
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,180
对不起  打断你的话了
I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you.

143
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,580
啊?  我们刚才说到哪了?
What, what, what were you saying?

144
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,180
说霍华德是个非常好的人
Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,350
他很有幽默感
He's got a great sense of humor.

146
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,980
他很爱他的妈妈
He loves his mother...

147
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,250
非常
a lot.

148
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,010
大家都说爱得有点过了
People say "too much."

149
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,910
你真是个忠实的好朋友
I really like that you're such a loyal friend.

150
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,710
没错
Yeah, I am loyal.

151
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,510
如果从全局来看的话
You know, if you look at the big picture.

152
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,810
仅仅是出于好奇
Out of curiosity,

153
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,550
他有很吸引你么?
did he ever have a shot with you?

154
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,550
你疯了么
Are you insane?

155
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,080
他带着个眼罩
The guy was wearing an eye patch.

156
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,450
那你为什么...
Then why did you...?

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,950
他说我可以在火星上开车
He said that I cou drive a car on Mars.

158
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,080
哦了
Got it.

159
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,380
我以后还能再见你吗
So, can I see you again?

160
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,780
你这就见不到我了  闭眼
You're not gonna see me now.

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,810
不错
Cool.

162
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,880
有什么发现么
Anything?

163
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,580
事实上我在查邮件
Actually, I was just checking my e-mail.

164
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,950
不过漫步者没有消息返回
But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.

165
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,950
我有个很恰当的比喻
I believe the appropriate metaphor here

166
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,480
一艘没有推进设备的
involves a river of excrement

167
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,180
美国土著的轮船
and a Native American water vessel

168
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,780
驶进了便便河
without any means of propulsion.

169
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,750
拜托
Hang on.

170
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,380
肯定会有办法的
There's got to be other options.

171
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,880
你可以给美国汽车协会打电话
You could try calling Triple-A.

172
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,880
不过根据美国国家航空航天管理局最近的日程安排
But based on NASA's latest timetable,

173
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,850
他们35年后才会到那
they won't get there for 35 years.

174
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,850
而且他们到的时候
Plus I understand you have to be standing

175
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,610
你必须在现场  带着你的会员卡
next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.

176
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,850
惨咯
Oh, snap.

177
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,150
按什么? [snap也有按钮的意思]
Snap what?

178
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,550
好吧  看来我们得进行B计划了
Okay, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.

179
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,810
什么是B计划
What's Plan B?

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,410
格式化所有硬盘  清除监控录像
Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes,

181
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,210
擦掉我们留下的所有指纹后逃跑
wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.

182
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,110
为什么这不是A计划
Why wasn'that Plan A?

183
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,850
美国国家航空航天管理局发言人指出由于数据的损失
A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data,

184
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,610
他们可能无法找出火星漫步者 发生故障的原因
they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover's malfunction.

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,410
人类对于火星的探索  这种令人失望的结果
This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars

186
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,710
已经不是第一次了
has ended in disappointment.

187
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,950
幸亏我们选了B计划
Thank God for Plan B.

188
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,210
霍华德  你不是说过你在研究火星漫步者么
Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?

189
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,750
没有  你搞错了
No, you're mistaken.

190
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,610
我第一次见你那天 你说如果我和你约会
Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you,

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,510
我就能在火星上开车
I could drive a car on Mars.

192
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,980
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,310
大家不好意思
Will you all excuse me?

194
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,610
莱纳德正悄悄给我打手势
Leonard is subtly signaling

195
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,150
示意我要和我私下谈谈
that he'd like to talk to me in private.

196
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,950
不会啊  我记得很清楚
No. Yeah, I remember specifically.

197
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,880
你最开始问我是不是从火星来的
You started by asking if I was from Mars

198
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,180
理由是我的屁股真的很翘
because my ass was out of this world.

199
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,780
是挺像我的风格  不过不是
Well, that does sound like me, but no.

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,110
有问题灭
Is there some problem?

201
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,280
对
Yeah.

202
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,310
我得出去一小会
Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.

203
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,880
好吧  拜拜
All right, good-bye.

204
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,780
等下
No, wait!

205
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,050
如果有人问你我去哪了  你就说不知道
If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.

206
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,050
你要去哪
Where ARE you going?

207
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,610
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you that.

208
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,110
谁会问我
Who would ask me?

209
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,280
那个我也不能说
I can't tell you that, either.

210
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,410
你叫我进来通知我
So you brought me in here to inform me

211
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,180
你不能告诉我你去哪
that you can't tell me where you're going

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,040
也不能告诉我谁会问起你去哪儿
and you can't tell me who might ask?

213
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,310
是的  是我考虑不周到
Yeah, I really didn't think this through.

214
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,680
莱纳德  等下
Leonard, a moment.

215
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,240
怎么了
What?

216
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,180
如有人...当然  还不确定是谁
If someone-- and of course, we don't know who this would be--

217
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,340
问你去哪了  我该怎么回答
does ask where you've gone, what should I say?

218
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,740
我不知道  就说我去办公室了
I don't know. Just tell 'em I went to the office.

219
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,680
-你要去办公室  -不
Are you going to the office? No.

220
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,680
那我怎么能理直气壮地说
Then how can I say it convincingly?

221
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,040
就说"莱纳德去办公室了"
Just say, "Leonard went to the office."

222
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,440
好的  莱纳德去办公室了
All right. Leonard went to <i>the office.</i>

223
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,410
那是...  不  不是这样
What is...? No, not like that!

224
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,840
就说"莱纳德去办公室了"
Just, "Leonard went to the office."

225
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,240
你要只告诉我你要去办公室
This would have worked out a lot better

226
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,340
就好办多了
if you'd just told me you were going to the office.

227
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,710
我要去办公室了
I'm going to the office.

228
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,510
看到没  为什么我不信你
See? Why don't I believe you?

229
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,910
我要出去会
I'm going out for a while.

230
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,780
好的
Okay.

231
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,040
没人想知道他去哪了吗
Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?

232
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,380
好的  他去哪了
Okay, where is he going?

233
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,740
莱纳德去办公室了
Leonard is going to <i>the office.</i>

234
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,470
今天工作如何
So how was work today?

235
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,000
忙碌
Busy.

236
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,600
切除了个阑尾  胆囊
I removed an appendix, a gall bladder

237
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,680
还有一尺半的肠子
and about a foot and a half of bowel.

238
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,400
希望是三个不同的老兄
I'm hoping that's three different guys.

239
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,000
不是  就一个人
No, just the one.

240
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,170
他没活下来
He didn't make it.

241
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,900
你今天过得怎么样
So, how was your day?

242
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,770
我是个物理学家  所以...
Oh, you know, I'm a physicist, so...

243
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,300
我思考
I thought about stuff.

244
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,970
就这些
That's it?

245
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,300
其中的一些我记下来了
Well, I wrote some of it down.

246
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,900
吃饱了吗
Are you done eating?

247
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,930
-饱了  -很好
Uh, yeah. Oh, good.

248
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,730
早知道你在等着
If I knew you were waiting,

249
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,160
面条不嚼我就咽了
I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,560
斯蒂芬妮·巴奈特医生家

Listen, if you're free Friday,

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,600
可来我家吃点东西
maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place.

256
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,000
我妈做的牛腩特别好吃
My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.

I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.

260
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,760
或许我们该去卧室
Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.

261
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,000
好主意
That's a good idea.

262
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,830
那有床  我非常...
There's a bed in there, and I'm very...

非常  非常喜欢床
very, very pro-bed.

Just want to let you know

268
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,960
周五晚餐人多起来了
the head count for dinner Friday has gone up.

269
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,760
我姨妈贝蒂和舅舅艾略特从棕榈泉来
My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs.

270
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,390
如有人问起
Oh, and if anybody should ask,

271
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,260
你母亲是犹太人
you're half-Jewish on your mother's side.

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,260
你不觉得该打电话告诉他你没兴趣吗
Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?

275
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,160
你现在想让我停下并打电话给他
Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?

276
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,720
我的神啊  不
Dear God, no!

277
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,620
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard...

278
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,560
斯蒂芬妮·巴奈特医生家
You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

279
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,460
请留言
Leave a message.

280
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,890
又是我  霍华德
Hey, it's me again. Howard.

281
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,860
我表兄妹从劳德尔堡 飞来见你
Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you

282
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,960
所以我们必须到 饭店吃晚餐了
so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.

283
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,460
告诉她我们去橄榄花园饭店
Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden!

284
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,820
我有报纸上的优惠券
I have a coupon from the paper.

285
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,120
我们不会去橄榄花园饭店  老妈
We're not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!

286
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,120
大人物和他的红龙虾
Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.

287
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,020
我们商讨好细节再打电话给你
I'll call you back when we firm up the details.

288
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,560
我是霍华德
It's Howard.

289
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,760
新T恤
New shirts?

290
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,920
对  一些
Yeah, a couple.

291
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,620
-不错  -谢谢
Nice. Thank you.

292
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,590
和哪个女孩约会呢
So, who's the girl?

293
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,760
抱歉
I'm sorry?

294
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,690
上次你买新T恤时我们在约会
Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.

295
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,990
这么说我们那会是在约会了
So what we did was in fact dating?

296
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,560
是啊  我们是约会过
Well, yeah, we did have a date.

297
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,860
千真万确  谢谢
Exactly. Thank you.

298
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,290
帮我个忙  下次见到库萨帕里的时候把刚才的话告诉他
Do me a favor. Tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.

299
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,560
她是谁
So, who is she?

300
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,790
她是个医生
Oh, she's a doctor.

301
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,190
不错
Oh, nice.

302
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,760
是真的医生  还是像你这种充数的
A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?

303
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,860
真的医生
Doctor doctor.

304
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,590
外科住院医
Surgical resident.

305
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,090
聪明  漂亮
Smart, pretty.

306
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,760
问你个事
Let me ask you something.

307
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,790
如你的朋友认为他在和某人约会
If your friend thinks he's dating someone,

308
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,720
但实际上却没有  然而你又在和这个人约会
but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her,

309
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,390
这样的话我算不算一个坏人
does that make you a bad person?

310
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,690
看情况了
Well, that depends.

311
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,690
什么情况
On what?

312
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,960
那朋友是沃罗威茨吗
Is that friend Wolowitz?

313
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,260
没错
Yeah.

314
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,760
去他的  你是好人
Screw him. You're fine.

315
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,730
你确定吗
Are you sure?

316
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,060
你和她上床了吗
Well, have you slept with her yet?

317
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,730
你个小坏蛋
You dog!

318
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,530
真有两下子
Good for you.

319
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,330
这改变什么了吗
Does that change things?

320
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,600
没有
No.

321
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,860
那你为什么问呢
So why'd you ask?

322
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,330
就是爱听闲事  回见
I'm nosy. See ya.

323
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,360
霍华德  开门
Howard, get the door!

324
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,600
有人敲门  你就这么应答吗
Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks?!

325
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,030
太感谢了  我不知道你会这样
Thank you. I had no idea!

326
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,160
伙计  什么风把你吹到寒舍了
Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?

327
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,130
是谁
Who is it?!

328
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
莱纳德
It's Leonard!

329
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,860
你们得去外面玩
You're gonna have to play outside!

330
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,030
我没穿见客的衣服
I'm not dressed to receive!

331
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,600
没人在乎的  妈
No one cares, Ma!

332
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
什么事
So, what's up?

333
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,500
我得和你谈点事
Listen, I need to talk to you about something.

334
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,460
稍等一下下
Momentito.

335
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,430
你好啊
Yello.

336
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,730
斯蒂芬妮
Oh, Stephanie,

337
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,200
感谢你回电  我还担心呢
thanks for calling me back. I was worried...

338
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
不用  我理解
No, I understand.

339
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,400
没问题  做朋友挺好的
Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely.

340
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,430
感谢回电
Thanks for calling.

341
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,260
你也过得愉快
Yeah, you have a nice day, too.

342
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,560
你个死人
You are dead to me.

343
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,840
好吧  谁吃剩下的这个水饺
Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?

344
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,110
石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克
Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.

345
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,010
好吧  我们其中之一不能再出史波克了
Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.

346
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,040
-那怎么决定  -石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克
How do we decide that? Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.

347
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,380
大伙好啊
Oh, hey, guys.

348
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,740
你好
Hello.

349
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,210
你好  霍华德
Hi, Howard.

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
霍华德
Howard?

351
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,440
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

352
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,540
霍华德开始使用 校园法则了  而他唯一的目的
Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are,

353
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,010
就是想表明你已经亡故了
for all intents and purposes, deceased.

354
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,250
他打算 通过不与你说话  以及在你说话时
He intends to act on this by not speaking to you,

355
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,720
假装没听见来对你采取措施
feigning an inability to hear you when you speak

356
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,620
另外  还拒绝承认你的存在
and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.

357
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,980
这也太荒谬了
That's just ridiculous.

358
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,620
你为何要配合他
Why are you cooperating with him?

359
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,620
规则不是我定的  莱纳德
I don't make the rules, Leonard.

360
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,280
霍华德  别这样  我不是有意为之的
Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this.

361
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,150
事情就这么自然而然的发生了
These things just happen.

362
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,850
通常不会发生在我身上  但还是发生了
Usually not to me, but they do happen.

363
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,850
有没有人感到有一股冷风
Did someone just feel a cold breeze?

364
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,780
我想这个隐喻是对死亡的引伸
I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor.

365
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,620
那股冷风就是所谓的灵的外质
The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue

366
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,220
一个脱离肉体的游魂
of a disembodied soul passing by.

367
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,250
不管了  我要吃剩下的一个了
You know, screw it. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

368
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,320
你好  斯蒂芬妮
Hey. Oh, hi, Steph.

369
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
进来吧  来的不是时候吗
Come on in. Is this a bad time?

370
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,720
对  不过我也看不出你什么时候来合适
Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so...

371
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,750
如果她不是死人之妇的话就好了
Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

372
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,350
你好  霍华德
Hello, Howard.

373
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,880
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

374
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,180
对不起  你违反了你的隐喻
I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor

375
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,820
承认了她的存在  我不玩了
by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.

376
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,420
他不听我解释
He just won't listen to me.

377
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,280
好吧  我想那就只有我们三个了
Okay, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.

378
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,720
利萨会很失望的  是呀
Lisa's gonna be disappointed. Yeah.

379
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,080
利萨
Lisa?

380
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,650
对  我室友
Yeah, my roommate.

381
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
她刚刚经历了一段糟糕的恋情
She just went throh a really bad breakup

382
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,120
我想她可能想见见像你这样识趣的人
and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.

383
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,900
莱纳德  斯蒂芬妮  你们又活过来了  这真是奇迹
Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive! It's a miracle.

384
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,880
利萨  不管怎样  我就想再说一次
So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again

385
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,880
我那晚过得很开心
how much I enjoyed the other night,

386
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,620
还有就是  这样结束了  我也很遗憾
and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

387
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,350
不过  如果这周五的情况你能让我知道的话
But again, if you could let me know about Friday.

388
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,050
我妈要知道有多少人
My mother needs a head count

389
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,980
这样她就知道该买多大的胸肉了
so she can know how big a brisket to get.

390
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,250
霍华德  霍华德  快看这个
Howard, Howard, look at this.

391
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,150
记得回我话
Anyway, call me.

392
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,280
科学家一直都在关注火星上是否存在生命  我是霍华德
The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists It's Howard.

393
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,720
看来其他人也在关注
and laypersons alike.

394
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,850
火星漫步者怎样进入裂缝还尚未得知
It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice,

395
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,550
但有一件事是确定的
but one thing's certain:

396
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,350
火星漫游者发送回来的数据
The data which it has sent back contain

397
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,720
第一次清楚地表明
the first clear indications

398
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,020
火星上真有可能存在生命
that there may have been life on Mars.

399
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:27,780
这个科学发现 对全人类来说都有巨大的意义
It's a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind.

400
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,650
遗憾的是  我们永远也不会知道这归功于谁
Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible.

401
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,680
真他妈的混蛋
Son of a bitch.
