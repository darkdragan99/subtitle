新漫画书的味道
That's the smell of new comic books.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,110
太棒了
Oh, yes.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,180
今天我来付账  伙计们
They're on me today, boys.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,710
你买单?
You're paying?

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,350
你又去卖精子了?
Have you been selling your sperm again?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,650
没有  只是庆祝一下

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,610
少给自己戴高帽
Oh, get over yourself.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,250
不就是高科技马桶嘛
It's a high-tech toilet.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,010
这么想
Just think.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,710
多亏你的杰作

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
好笑吗
Is that supposed to be funny?

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,110
确实好笑
I believe it is.

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,710
结合引用《星际旅行》
The combination of the star trek reference

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,550
和双重含义的动词

去[拉]
Of the verb "to go"

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,210
说明莱纳德拿你的
Suggests that leonard is humorously mocking

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,610
太空管道工程开玩笑呢
Your efforts in space plumbing.

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,910
行  开你们的小玩笑吧

He's right. this is an important achievement, for two reasons.

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,750
可以一号[小便]

30
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,850
还能二号[大便]
And, of course, number two!

31
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,510

Here, sheldon, I pulled the new hellboy for you.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,180

It's mind-blowing.

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,480
喂  严重剧透
Excuse me. spoiler alert.

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,850
我没有透露什么啊
I didn't spoil anything.

38
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,580
你说了很刺激
You told me it's mind-blowing.

39
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,550
我的思维已经开始提前刺激了
So, my mind is going into it pre-blown.

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,280
一旦提前刺激  还谈什么再刺激
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.

41
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,710
抱歉
I'm sorry.

让圣诞怪杰跟圣诞节道歉去吧
Said the grinch to christmas.

莱纳德
Uh, hey, leonard.

44
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,410
我能跟你谈件事吗
Could I talk to you about something?

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,210
可以  什么事
Sure, what's up?

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,480
还记得几周前
Remember I went out with

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,910
我和你朋友佩妮约会的事吗
Your friend, penny, a couple weeks ago?

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,310
不太记得
Yeah, vaguely.

49
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,550
你肯定记得
Sure you remember.

50
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,550
你那晚还傻乎乎地
That was the night you went to the bar and made a fool

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,150
去酒吧找陌生女人呢
Of yourself trying to pick up strange women.

52
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,450
怎么了
What about it?

53
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,080
上次约会不太顺利
Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.

54
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,410
真不幸
Oh. too bad.

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,250
我想现在能做的就是爬起来
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up,

56
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,250
拍拍身上的土  忘记她向前看
Dust yourself off, forget it and move on.

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,150
我做不到
I can't do that.

58
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,680
见鬼了做不到
Why the hell not?

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,110
因为我们明天还有个约会
'cause we're going out again tomorrow.

60
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,510
打扰一下  斯图尔特
Excuse me, stuart.

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,750
你看了新的《闪电侠》吗
Have you read the new flash?

62
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,110
-没看呢  -我看了
- No. - well, I have

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,980
大为惊叹呢
And it will knock your socks off!

64
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,410
看你还能不能再惊叹
Good luck getting them back on.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,910
怎么说呢
Uh, anyway,

66
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,010
我觉得这可能是我和佩妮最后的机会了
I figure this is probably my last shot with penny

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,110
我不想搞砸了
And I don't want to screw it up.

68
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,250
谁都不想搞砸
Nobody wants that.

69
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,450
问题就是  这是第二次约会
Here's my question:it's the second date,

70
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,310
你觉得她会想要进一步的身体接触么
You think she'll be expecting things to get physical?

71
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,550
老天
Uh, gee, um...

72
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,610
我初步的建议是不要
My initial reaction is "no," but, um,

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,280
让我想想再回答你吧
Let me think about it and get back to you, okay?

74
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,010
那你打我电话吧
Okay, so, you'll give me a call?

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,050
你打我电话也行
Yeah, or you call me.

76
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,380
好的
Great.

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,210
谁都不打最好
Or nobody calls anyone.

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,580
有意思
Interesting.

79
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,050
佩妮的现任追求者寻求前任追求者的建议
Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.

80
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,250
拉杰  谢谢你的友情字幕提示
You know, thanks for closed- captioning my pain, raj.

81
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,010
你想确保他既得不到佩妮
Hey, want to make sure he gets nowhere with penny

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,610
又不伤害你和他们的友情么
Without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,210
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,150
直接让他做过去两年
Just tell him to do everything

85
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,480
你对佩妮做过的一切
You've done with her for the last two years.

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,280
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第22集

87
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,270
好啊  莱纳德
Hey, leonard.

88
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,400
你好
Oh, hi.

89
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,930
-最近如何  -很好
- How's it going? - good, good.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,030
-你呢  -也好
- You? - fine.

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,000
我能问你件事么
Oh, hey, can I ask you something?

92
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,900
当然
Sure.

93
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,670
关于你的朋友斯图尔特
You know your friend stuart?

94
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,700
怎么了
Yes.

95
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,530
他又约我出去  我答应了
Well, he asked me out again and I said yes,

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,830
然后我觉得
And then I started thinking

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,230
应该先和你谈谈
Maybe I should talk to you first.

98
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,470
谈什么
About what?

99
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,400
我和你朋友约会
Well, does it bother you,

100
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,400
你会不会觉得困扰
Me going out with one of your friends?

101
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,630
我们从前...
'cause you know, you and me...

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,070
不会  过去的事了
No. no, that's the past.

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,300
我会与时俱进
I'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy.

104
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,200
活在当下
You know, living in the moment.

105
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,800
虽然我还和未来扯上点关系
Although I do have to live a little in the future,

106
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,370
那是因为我的工作
'cause, well, that's my job.

107
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,300
当然我对经典科幻的喜爱
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction

108
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,200
也时常将我带回往昔
Does draw my attention backwards,

109
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,000
但这类故事经常发生在未来
But those stories often take place in the future.

110
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,470
总之  不会困扰我的
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.

111
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,730
好吧  你真大度
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.

112
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,430
我不会说大度
Yeah, well, I wouldn't say cool.

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
我只会说
I'd just say...

114
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,230
这才是莱纳德
"that's leonard!"

115
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,070
这样说来  你能不能给我点建议
Well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?

116
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,770
关于斯图尔特的
About stuart?

117
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,230
没问题
Love to.

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,000
他很内向的
He's very shy.

119
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,230
我怎么能让他觉得和我在一起觉得更舒服
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?

120
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
首先  不要低估了
Well, first of all, don't underestimate

121
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,730
不舒服这个词的程度
The value of discomfort.

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,230
-真的  -是的
- Really? - oh, yes.

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,930
斯图尔特有压力才有动力
Stuart thrives under pressure.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,170
所以他才会在漫画书店工作
That's why he works in a comic book store.

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,150
是斯图尔特
Oh, it's stuart.

126
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,650
你不接么?
You're not going to answer it?

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,420
他想谈佩妮的事
He wants to talk about penny.

128
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,820
而我不想
I don't want to talk about penny.

129
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,020
你在做一个假设
You're making an assumption.

130
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,750
但万一是漫画店失火了呢
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.

131
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,320
他需要你的帮助
And he needs your assistance.

132
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,190
他怎么会打给我?
Why would he call me?

133
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,820
我们不知道
We don't know.

134
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,550
我们没法知道  除非你接电话
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,290
谢尔顿  我不会接的
I'm not answering the phone, sheldon.

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,450
-接电话  莱纳德  -不
- Answer the phone, leonard. - no!

137
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,990
好了  进到语音信箱里了
There, it went to voice mail.

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
你不准备查语音信息么?
Aren't you going to check your messages?

139
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,390
不
No.

140
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,350
你一定要查查信息  莱纳德
You have to check your messages, leonard!

141
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,690
留语音信息
The in a

142
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,450
是社会契约的一半
Is one half of a social contract

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,190
而另一半要由查信息来完成
Which is completed by the checking of the message.

144
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,650
如果这个契约被打破了
If that contract breaks down,

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,690
整个社会的契约就都坍塌了
Then all social contracts break down

146
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,050
而我们就堕落到无政府状态
And we descend into anarchy.

147
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,550
你脑袋里肯定是一片狼藉
It must be hell inside your head.

148
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,450
偶尔会这样
At times.

149
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,220
哥几个  红色警戒
Guys, we have a code red.

150
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,190
你是指医院的紧急警报
You mean "code red" the hospital emergency alert,

151
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,120
还是蠕虫病毒
"code red" the computer worm, or "code red" the cherry-flavored

152
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,560
还是百事出品的樱桃味汽水?
Soft drink from the makers of mountain dew?

153
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,860
我检查零重力马桶的图纸时
Look, I was going over the schematics

154
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,660
在转向阀的说明里
On my zero-g toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,360
我发现了一个小小小小的错误
On the specifications for the diverter valve.

156
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,390
有多小?
How teeny tiny?

157
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
大概冲了十次以后就该坏了
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.

158
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,220
但任务要持续六个月呢
But the mission is for six months.

159
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,420
说的就是这个红色警戒
Yeah, see, that's the code red.

160
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,090
这就像魔术箱
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

161
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,260
没人知道什么时候  但总会在某个时候
No one knows exactly when, but at some point

162
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,020
有些比木偶更恶的东西 会从那个盒子里跳出来
Something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.

163
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
你通知航天局了么?
Have you notified nasa?

164
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,460
你疯了?  我该怎么说?
No, are you crazy? what am I gonna say?

165
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,070
我搞砸了你们的马桶
"i screwed up your toilet and pretty soon

166
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,270
不久之后
"there's gonna be crap floating

167
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,700
你们整洁的太空站里将漂满大便?
All over your nice shiny space station"?

168
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,300
那你准备怎么做?
So, what are you gonna do?

169
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,300
我先想出怎么修理  然后再告诉他们
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.

170
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,300
那要我们做什么
So, what do you need us for?

171
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,600
他想不出来怎么修理
He can't figure out how to fix it.

172
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,870
你说过你会支持我的
Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.

173
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,300
我努力着呢
I'm trying,

174
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,670
但你得承认这实在太搞笑了
but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.

175
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,070
我同意
I agree.

176
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,000
宇宙探索的高科技性
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature

177
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,030
与马桶事故的平凡 进行的对比
Of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet

178
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,670
在这里提供了笑点
That provides the comic fodder here.

179
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,070
快查你的信息
Check your messages.

180
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,480
好了  这是和国际空间站
All right, this is an exact duplicate

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,750
配备的沃罗威茨零重力废物处理系统
Of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system

182
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
一模一样的副本
As deployed on the international space station.

183
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,210
你说的是沃罗威茨零重力 人类排泄物"散布"系统吧
Don't you mean the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste distribution system?

184
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,110
好样的
Good one.

185
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,380
真好笑
Yeah, it's hilarious.

186
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,980
现在
Now...

187
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,910
这些是太空站中
Here's an approximation of the spare parts

188
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,580
大概有的备用零件
Available on the space station.

189
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,810
我们要想个方法  只用这些零件
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,

190
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,310
来加固这个
To reinforce this so the waste material

191
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,650
避免堵住旋转涡轮
Avoids the spinning turbine.

192
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,210
你是说不要打中风扇?[酿成大祸]
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

193
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,910
我不得不说
Yeah, I have to say,

194
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,150
我以为重复说马桶笑话会变得无聊
I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.

195
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,910
显然  用太空便便
Apparently, there is no law

196
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,610
做笑点完全无懈可击呢
Of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.

197
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,050
-你好  莱纳德  -好啊  斯图尔特
- Hey, leonard. - hey, stuart.

198
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,650
-你在忙吗  -呃...
- You busy? - um...

199
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,710
这是机密  莱纳德
Classified, leonard.

200
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,680
不过是项常规曼哈顿工程罢了
Yeah, it's a regular manhattan project.

201
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,850
啥事
What's up?

202
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,050
我今晚要和佩妮约会
Well, tonight's my date with penny

203
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,010
鉴于我们没法通电话
And since we haven't been able to connect by phone...

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,550
真是抱歉  手机坏了
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.

205
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,410
-电邮也不行  -那也坏了
- Or e-mail. - yeah, that's broken, too.

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
能坏的都坏了
Everything's broken.

207
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,050
最后时刻  希望你能给我点建议
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.

208
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,980
好吧  正好灵光一现
Uh, all right, well, off the top of my head,

209
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,750
和佩妮一起时  最关键的
You know, I think the most important thing with penny

210
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,280
就是要慢慢来
Is to go really slow.

211
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,150
相当慢那种
I mean, glacial.

212
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,450
好吧
Okay.

213
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,650
她平时总是被男人围着
You know, guys come onto her all the time,

214
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,280
所以  你得矜持一点
So, you need to set yourself apart.

215
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,080
羞涩一点
You know, be a little shy,

216
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,950
少点眼神交流
Don't make too much eye contact.

217
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,750
和她保持一种冷酷的疏离感
And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment

218
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,110
说白了就是畏惧感
And-and, you know, fear.

219
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,950
畏惧?
Fear?

220
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,450
对  就像
Yeah, like, uh,

221
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,810
你生怕一碰她就碎
You're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.

222
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,180
这个我很拿手呢
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.

223
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,080
很好
Good, good.

224
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,650
今晚玩儿得开心点
Well, uh, you-you kids have fun tonight.

225
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,410
-多谢  莱纳德  -客气啥
- Thanks, leonard. - uh-huh.

226
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,110
那个到底是啥玩意儿
What is that thing anyway?

227
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,650
你不知道吗
You don't know what this is?

228
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,850
-不知道  -很好  滚
- No. - good. get out.

229
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,410
害怕佩妮
Be afraid of penny.

230
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,050
很狡猾嘛
Nice. very crafty.

231
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,050
这又不是馊主意
It wasn't bad advice.

232
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,280
只是不太管用罢了
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

233
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,280
不管怎样  俺娘常说  为一己私欲
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive

234
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,020
而欺骗他人  会遭报应的
for personal gain, we make jesue cry.

235
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,750
好了  何不用这个2英寸PVC管
All right, what if we use this two-inch pvc

236
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,310
加固中间的交叉支撑呢?
To reinforce the center cross-support?

237
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,710
不行
No good.

238
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,450
对日本人和美国人或许有用
I mean, it might work for the japanese

239
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,480
你要知道太空舱里的
And the americans, but have you seen the size

240
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,480
俄罗斯人什么体型
Of the russians they got up there?

241
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,250
这东西得撑得起
This thing has to hold up

242
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,010
一群狂吃马铃薯的家伙
Against a hearty potato-based diet.

243
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,350
我感觉很难过
I feel terrible.

244
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,750
过来帮帮忙就不会难过了
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.

245
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,350
我故意破坏斯图尔特和佩妮的约会
I deliberately tried to sabotage stuart's date with penny.

246
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
不难过才怪
Of course you feel terrible.

247
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,080
你完全搞砸了自己的"业"[印度教]
You completely screwed up your karma, dude.

248
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,950
你不会这么迷信吧
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?

249
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,280
这不是迷信
It's not superstition.

250
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,880
这跟牛顿学说差不多
It's practically newtonian.

251
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,150
任何作用力
For every action,

252
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,880
都会产生相等的反作用力
There's an equal and opposite reaction.

253
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,550
莱纳德表面像朋友
Leonard pretends to be a friend

254
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,980
实际行为却像个两面派婊子
And acts like a two-faced bitch.

255
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,010
因此  他会转世变成香蕉虫
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

256
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,180
其实是个完美的体系
It's actually a very elegant system.

257
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,710
这就是因果循环
You know, what goes around comes around.

258
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,310
说到循环
Speaking of what goes around comes around...

259
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,310
好吧
Okay, look.

260
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,650
与其加强这里的结构
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here,

261
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,680
何不干脆另建一个通道来疏通呢
What if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?

262
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,380
行不通  管道直径不够
It won't work. the diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

263
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,410
那重置收集槽呢
What if we reposition the collection tank?

264
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,150
行不通  没地儿放
It won't work. no way to mount it.

265
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,310
我有个主意
Okay, here's an idea.

266
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,910
我干脆从此隐姓埋名
What if I change my name and go live

267
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,480
投靠以色列的堂姐艾薇和她老公
With my cousin and her husband, avi, in israel?

268
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,180
这个行得通
That could work.

269
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,960
-早安  -早安  怎么了
- Morning. morning. - what's up?

270
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,800
没什么  我们熬了一夜
Nothing. we just pulled an all-nighter

271
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,060
修理一台零重力...意粉机
Trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.

272
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,800
我出去买点咖啡  你要吗
I'm going to make a coffee run. do you want any?

273
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,360
不  谢了  我有
Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.

274
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,930
很好  那昨晚的约会进展如何
Great. so how'd it go with stuart last night?

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
我实在不想谈
Um, I really don't want to talk about it.

276
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,600
当然可以
Yeah. right. sure.

277
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,830
不过  你们出去之前
The thing is, uh, before you guys went out,

278
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,260
我和他谈过  我...
I spoke to him and i...

279
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,800
我说了  我不想谈
I said I don't want to talk about it.

280
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,030
-我只是觉得...  -莱纳德
- Okay, I just, I kind of feel... - look, leonard,

281
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,030
我和斯图尔特之间的事和你无关
What goes on between me and stuart is none of your business.

282
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,680
别管闲事了  行吧
So just leave it alone, okay?

283
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,130
你如果真想赎罪
If you really want to clean up your karma,

284
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,060
就快去帮我买拿铁
Go get my freakin' latte.

285
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,730
等下  我想到了
Hang on, I think I've got this.

286
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,360
帮我把这一小片PVC塑料
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece

287
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,960
塞进支撑杆后面
Of pvc behind the support rod.

288
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,460
你高估自己建的
I think you're overestimating the tensile strength

289
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,800
玩意的抗张强度了吧
Of the substructure you're building.

290
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,660
谢尔顿  我自有分寸
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

291
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,730
你要是有分寸  这里就不会放着太空马桶
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be

292
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,730
而是放着我的咖啡桌
A space toilet where my coffee table should be.

293
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,360
霍华德  等等
Howard,wait...

294
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,930
为什么不用这个代替PVC管
Why don't you ou use this instead of the pvc

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,030
来辅助横向滤波器安装到位呢
To keep the transverse filter assembly in place?

296
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,130
因为这个东东不是空间站的零件
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,300
这是比萨饼盒子里
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps

298
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,560
用来避免盒盖接触起司的
The lid from touching the cheese.

299
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,260
就是这个用途吗
That what that's for?

300
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,830
在印度  盒盖就盖在起司上面
In india, the lid just touches the cheese.

301
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,630
当然了  我们还有极度的贫穷
Of course, we also have rampant

302
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,930
和周期性肆虐的霍乱
Poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,530
所以起司里有个小纸板也没啥大不了的
So a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.

304
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,430
-你去哪儿  -漫画书店
- Where are you going? - comic book store.

305
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,160
好主意呀  我可以借机休息
Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.

306
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,330
-我也是  -等等
- Me, too.- Now, hold on.

307
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,500
只要航天员能安全地在太空中大便
You guys can go to the comic book store

308
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,930
我就让你们去漫画书店
When man can once again safely poop in space.

309
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,430
为什么莱纳德可以去
Why does Leonard get to go?

310
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,660
因为他跟佩妮的关系现在纠缠不清
'cause he's upset over his situation with penny

311
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,230
要是再让我听到一次
And if I have to hear about it again,

312
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,760
我就把他卵巢那个地方踢飞
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

313
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,430
霍华德  谢谢你的理解
Thanks for understanding, howard.

314
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,260
姐妹  我支持你
I got your back, sister.

315
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,860
好啦  我觉得这台
All right, I think we've got

316
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,630
原型机可以开始接受测试了
A prototype ready to test.

317
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,830
把那个特百惠盒子递给我
Hand me that Tupperware.

318
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,600
哇  真重啊
Wow, that's heavy.

319
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,460
当然重  是我妈妈做的肉馅糕
Damn right it's heavy. it's my mother's meat loaf.

320
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,000
已经用它测试了无数次马桶了
It's been testing toilets for generations.

321
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,660
我必须指出  霍华德  如果给麻省理工写封信
I must say, howard, I think a detailed letter to mit

322
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,130
描述你目前状况  可能会让他们
Describing your current circumstances might entitle you

323
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,660
退回你的硕士学位
To a refund on your master's degree.

324
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,060
好的  模拟零重力环境人类排泄物处理测试
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test

325
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,400
肉馅糕模拟物已就绪
With meat loaf analog in...

326
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,000
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

327
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,760
很好很强大
Fascinating.

328
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,530
你觉得问题出在哪
What do you think the problem is?

329
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,830
面包屑放得不够
Not enough bread crumbs.

330
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,930
-斯图尔特  我想跟你谈谈  -当然  怎么了
- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you. - Sure, what's up?

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,030
关于佩妮  我觉得我给了你一些很坏的建议
I think I gave you some bad advice about penny,

332
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,400
我想道歉
And I want to apologize.

333
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,800
别啊  你的建议挺不错的
Oh, no, your advice was great.

334
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,000
真的
It was?

335
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,460
是啊  "慢慢来"确实管用
Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

336
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,700
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

337
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,030
对我来说从来不管用
Never worked for me.

338
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,530
昨天吃晚饭的时候  我按照你说的做了
Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me.

339
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,500
我尽量慢慢来  并且保持距离
I went really slow, I kept my distance,

340
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,760
然后两瓶红酒下肚  我们就在车里亲热了
And two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.

341
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,860
红酒  我没说要给她喝红酒啊
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

342
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,160
没事  因为从那开始就出乱子了
It doesn't matter, 'cause that's where it all went to hell.

343
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,660
接吻的时候
During the kissing?

344
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,700
你做了什么  对着她的嘴打喷嚏么
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?

345
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,060
我对一个女孩儿做过一次
I did that to a girl once.

346
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,830
没  一切正常  我俩也很投入
No, everything was good and really hot.

347
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,730
然后我说
And I said,

348
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,730
"噢  佩妮"  就在
"Oh, penny," and right where

349
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,030
她应该说"噢  斯图尔特"的时候  她却说了
She was supposed to say, "oh, Stuart," she said...

350
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,660
你的名字
Your name.

351
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,930
"莱纳德"吗
"Leonard"?

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,290
-那是你的名字吧  -是啊 不是 是
- That is your name, right? - yeah, no, yeah.

353
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,300
我很抱歉
Wow, I'm sorry.

354
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,400
你肯定不想听这样的话
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.

355
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,630
跟"你知道我很花心"不相上下了
Well, it beats, "you know I'm a dude, right?"

356
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
确实很糟糕
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

357
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,300
当然  当然
Yeah. no doubt, no doubt.

358
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,130
我很抱歉你俩没啥进展
Okay, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

359
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
不是你的错
Not your fault.

360
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,600
还真不是我的错
Yeah, how about that.

361
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,600
-再见  -拜拜
- See you soon. - Yeah, sure

362
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,460
是的  先生  我知道什么是"机密"
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."

363
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,160
我们会守口如瓶  没人会知道
We'll keep it all classified; no one has to know

364
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,490
只有你知我知
Anything about this but you and me.

365
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,390
什么机密
What's classified?

366
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,990
霍华德的太空马桶
Howard's space toilet.

367
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,660
等下再跟你讲
I'll tell you later.

368
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,230
他们已经部署了我们的解决方案
Well, they've deployed our solution.

369
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,160
一起祈祷它会奏效吧
Let's just all hope it works.

370
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,490
我看不出来跟我有什么关系
I don't see why I have to worry.

371
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,230
又不是我的饭碗岌岌可危
My career's not hanging in the balance.

372
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,760
是个玩笑
That was a joke.

373
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,530
笑点在于  它是真的
It's funny, because it's true.

374
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,930
莱纳德  你能不能把酱油递过来
Leonard, could you pass the soysauce please？

375
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,490
抱歉  你跟我说话吗
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

376
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,380
是啊  我叫的是你
Yeah,I said Leonard.

377
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,400
你确实叫的是我呢
Yes, you did, didn't you?

378
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,660
什么鬼东西啊
What the hell is that?

379
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,180
肉馅糕
Meat Loaf.

380
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,820
它怎么会在天花板上
What was it doing on the ceiling?

381
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,040
那是机密
That's classified.

382
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,360
[国际空间站]

383
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,760
休斯顿航天中心  这是国际空间站
Houston, uh, International Space Station.

384
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,590
我们遇到点小麻烦
We have a little situation up here.

385
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,830
我们想进行一次计划外的太空行走
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.

386
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,560
空间站  这是休斯顿航天中心
I.S.S., Houston.

387
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,160
请问哪名航天员会参与此次舱外活动
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?

388
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,020
休斯顿  全体成员都想到舱外几分钟
Houston, uh, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.

389
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,540
空间站
I.S.S.

390
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,460
我恐怕不能授权
I'm afraid we can't authorize that...

391
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,460
休斯顿  其实是想知照一下
Houston, this is more of a FYI call

392
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,450
我们其实已经全都出舱了
We are basically out the door.
