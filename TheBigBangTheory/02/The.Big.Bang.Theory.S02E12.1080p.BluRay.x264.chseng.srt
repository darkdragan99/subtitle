1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,890
好了 最后一个部件
All right,that's the last servo.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,860
人家看到的 是全方位运动 销毁终结切割器
Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,180
或者 Mont-E
Or...MONTE.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,450
装有铰接式锋利锯齿 聚碳酸脂磨刀和转动轮
Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw,one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,950
从上到下为钢制金属板外壳 其马力足以将110磅的机械
steel-armor plate exoskeleton top and bottom,and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,070
彻底毁灭 只需短短4.8秒
from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,440
如果说我爱我们的机器人杀手 是不是大罪过?
Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,830
跟对我爸爸一样 我既爱它又怕它
As with my father,I both love and fear it.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,020
好了 废话少说 我们来搞点破坏
All right,enough chitchat. Let's destroy something.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,140
1 2 3
1,2,3

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,180
好了 让谁先来尝尝猛械的厉害
Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,260
也许我们该从小的东西开始
*************

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:53,040
好吧 也许今天我们最终可以搞清楚 这个魔法球里有什么了
**************

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,320
我四岁时就做过了
Did it when I was four.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,760
是个二十面体染色物在蓝水里漂浮
It's an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,970
老兄 说之前给个"剧透"警告好吧
Man,call "spoiler alert" before you say things like that.

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,390
烤面包机怎么样?
How about the toaster oven?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,330
烤面包机咋得罪你了?
What did the toaster oven ever do to you?

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,810
三年级时 我又咋得罪吉姆·马林斯了?
What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade?

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,740
他照样用我的拳头朝我的脸打了一拳
He still punched me in the face with my own fists.

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,560
抱歉 可爱的小呆子 你在错误的时间出现错误的房间
Sorry,you little nerd,you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,820
同志们 护眼镜
Gentlemen,goggles.

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,990
这可是个历史性的时刻
This is an auspicious moment.

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,970
制造第一枚核武器和第一次登月
就像罗伯特·奥本海默和尼尔·阿姆斯壮
Like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,540
我们得编句合适的台词 来纪念这个有历史意义的科学事件
we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,540
"死吧 烤面包机 去死吧!"怎么样?
How about "Die,toaster,die"?

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,580
我看行
That'll do it.

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,920
好啦 接下来砍什么?
All right,what's next?

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,610
不了 我今晚要呆在家里洗衣服
No,I think I'm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,580
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第12集

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,740
噢 耶 这门被猛械毁了
Oh,yeah,this door got the full Monte.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,500
莱纳德?
Leonard?

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,460
怎么回事?
What the hell?

34
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,690
机器人杀手 我们造的
Killer robot. We built it.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,960
是吗 它差点杀了我
Yeah,well,it almost killed me.

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,050
它要是想杀你 你早死了
If it wanted to kill you,you'd be dead.

37
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,640
那么 它到底想杀谁?
So,who exactly does it want to kill?

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,160
抱歉 难道你不知道即将举行的 南加州机器人格斗循环邀请赛?
I'm sorry,are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,160
知道吗 从我去年搬来以后 不是所有的邮件都被转寄掉
You know,since I moved last year,not all my mail has been forwarded.

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,310
这可是件大事
It's a big deal.

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,080
会有颁奖宴会还有舞会
There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward.

42
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,450
也许你会想跟我一起去
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,850
我相信其他人看见女生 肯定会很兴奋
I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.

44
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,330
如果就我一个女生去 怎么能叫舞会呢?
How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?

45
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,230
好吧 也许这么说有点夸张
Well,that may be a slight exaggeration.

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,840
你是唯一可以上的女孩
You'd be the only doable girl.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,930
你是头猪 霍华德
You're a pig,Howard.

48
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,900
"可以上"是在赞美你 没别的意思
How is "doable" anything but a compliment?

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,510
霍华德 我们还是搞机器人吧
Howard,why don't we just work on the robot?

50
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,670
拜托 莱纳德 现在不是时候
Please,Leonard,not now.

51
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,670
又一次 佩妮和我开始了 我们的双人探戈
Once again,Penny and I have begun our little tango.

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,860
我们的探戈?
Our tango?

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,980
肉体的博弈 性欲的推拉
The carnal repartee,the erotic to and fro.

54
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,330
尽管开胃菜很美味
But as delicious as the appetizer might be,

55
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,690
我们还是该屈从 吃下主菜 趁它还是...
at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entr\e while it's still...

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,270
热的
hot.

57
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,690
求你了 不要再说了
I'm begging you,stop talking.

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,550
听着 通常呢 我无视你就好了
Look,normally I can just ignore you.

59
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,260
我知道 你有点古怪
I mean,I get it-- you're a little peculiar.

60
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,380
就像谢尔顿
You know,like Sheldon.

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,460
抱歉 佩妮 但是在这间屋里 你才是古怪的那个
Excuse me,Penny,but in this room,you're the one who's peculiar.

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,740
嗯 也许你说的对
Yeah,you might be right.

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,580
但是回到你身上
But back to you.

64
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,360
我知道你认为自己是个 能言善辩的少女杀手
I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man,

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,810
但事实是 你很可悲又恶心
but the truth is,you are just pathetic and creepy.

66
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,170
那么 啥意思呢?
So what are you saying?

67
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,870
我的意思是说我是"可以上的" 根本就不是啥赞美
I am saying it is not a compliment to call me "doable."

68
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,200
盯着我的屁股看并说 "喔~ 这肯定是果冻"
It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say,Ooh,

69
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,330
"因为果酱不会这样晃动" 一点也不性感
it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,950
还有最重要的 我们没有在跳探戈 我们没有你推我拉
And most important,we are not dancing a tango,we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

71
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,030
我们之间不会有什么 永远不会
Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.

72
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,090
等一下 这不是在调情 你在说真的?
Wait a minute. This isn't flirting. You're serious.

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,420
调情? 你认为我在跟你调情?
Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you?

74
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,780
我根本没有在和你调情
I am not flirting with you.

75
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,690
没有女人会和你调情
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

76
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,990
你只会慢慢变老 孤独而终
You're just gonna grow old and die alone.

77
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,120
谢谢你的提醒
Thanks for the heads up.

78
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,230
霍华德 你去哪里?
Howard,where you going?

79
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,460
我回家继续过我的 恶心的可悲的人生
I'm going home to live my creepy,pathetic life.

80
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,620
总得有人说吧
Well,someone had to say it.

81
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,600
什么?
What?

82
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,800
他说也许我们该拿你参加机器人杀手大赛
He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.

83
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,280
霍华德 电话在响!
Howard,the phone is ringing!

84
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,650
我有个疯狂的主意 老妈 接电话如何!
Here's a crazy idea,Ma: Answer it!

85
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,600
你好?
Hello?

86
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,210
好的 稍等
All right,hold on.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,120
是你朋友 莱纳德!
It's your friend,Leonard!

88
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,930
他想知道你为什么今天没去上学!
He wants to know why you're not at school today!

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,740
我不是去上学 老妈 我在大学就职
I don't go to school,Ma. I work at a university.

90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,990
那就是学校! 快接电话!
That's a school! Now pick up the phone!

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
我谁都不想理
I don't want to talk to anybody.

92
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,710
要我叫莱纳德把你的家庭作业带来吗?
Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework? !

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,210
我没什么家庭作业的
I don't have homework.

94
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,030
我是个拥有工程学硕士的大爷们
I'm a grown man with a master's degree in engineering!

95
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,530
抱歉 了不起先生
Excuse me,Mr. Fancy-Pants.

96
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,580
想吃冰棒吗?
Want me to get you a Popsicle?

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,850
樱桃味的 好吧!
Cherry,please!

98
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,140
樱桃味的我吃了 只剩蔬菜味的了
I ate the cherry. All that's left is green.

99
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,080
你让我真想自杀呀
You make me want to kill myself.

100
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,880
怎么了?
What's going on?

101
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,420
不知道 他们正为冰棒问题吵呢
I don't know,now they're just yelling about Popsicles.

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,980
好像佩妮真地伤到他了
Sounds like Penny really got to him.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
我觉得不意外呀
I'm not surprised.

104
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,930
尽管霍华德用坚强的外壳来保护自己 其实他是个非常敏感的人
Despite his hard and crusty shell,Howard is a very sensitive man.

105
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,570
知道他还写诗吗?
Do you know he writes poetry?

106
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,220
大多是关于来自楠塔基特岛的人 和叫戴维的隐居士
Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave,

107
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,800
但他是用心去写的
but he does it with real sensitivity.

108
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,310
嘿 霍夫施塔特
Hey,Hofstadter.

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,430
等离止誓验室 谣传你们在造机器银
Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?

110
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,150
对 我们造了 克里帕奇
Yes,we did,Kripke.

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,150
他名叫猛械
His name is Monte.

112
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,160
如果你着梦操控他来 南加州机器银格斗循环邀请晒
Well,if you have any dewusions about entering him against my wobot,

113
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,530
对抗我克里帕奇 克里骇人的机器银
the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Robot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational,

114
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,010
又简称S.c.r.f.l.r.r.i
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

115
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,070
他就该改名叫金属废物银了
his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.

116
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,480
得了吧 真的非要这样吗?
Come on,is that really necessary?

117
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,220
莱纳德 看来需要的
Leonard,I believe it is.

118
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,330
这是上场前嘴上较劲 是所有竞技的传统部分
This is trash talk,and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events.

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,840
克里帕奇 你的机器人很差劲 会败在我们的脚下
Kripke,your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours

120
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,240
因为我们在设计与做工上都超越你
because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution.

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,280
还有 我听说你老妈是肥婆
Also,I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.

122
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,790
哇 够狠呀
Oh,snap.

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,900
当然 如果是腺分泌的关系 而没有懒散和贪食
Now,of course,if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony,

124
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,500
我收回我的批判
I withdraw that comment.

125
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,770
哪有什么区别?胖还是胖呀
What difference does it make? Fat is fat.

126
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,760
有分界线的
There are boundaries.

127
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,940
听好了 忘了S.c.r.f.l.r.r.i.
Tell you what,forget the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,520
偶棉来个机器银一对一吧
Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

129
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,030
什么意思?
What do you mean?

130
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,830
循环晒上我们不一定碰得上
There's no guarantee we're gonna go against each other in the Wound Wobin,

131
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,910
咱现在就对决吧
so let's throw down.

132
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,150
要是怕怕就算鸟
You know,unless you're afwaid.

133
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,490
我们接受你的挑战 定个时间和地点吧
We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,150
明天 3:00 动力学实验室
Tomorrow,3:00,the kinetics wab.

135
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,160
就这么说定了
Make it so.

136
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,180
不 别定下来 贝瑞 我们明天不能和你战斗
No,don't make it so. Barry,we can't fight you tomorrow.

137
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,430
我们的工程师崩溃了
Our engineer is incapacitated.

138
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,460
他怎么了?
What's wrong with him?

139
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,270
他可悲又古怪 找不到女人 所以他抑郁了
He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and can't get girls.

140
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,120
我们都可悲又古怪 找不到女人
We're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls.

141
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,460
所以我们才玩机器银格斗
That's why we fight wobots.

142
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,910
如果不出现 就等着当笑柄吧
If you're not there,you'll be exposed to widicule.

143
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,220
我很好奇 他这说的是啥方言啊?
I'm curious,what part of America is that accent from?

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
嘿 有时间吗?
Hey,you got a minute?

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
有 进来吧 啥事呢?
Yeah,come on in. What's up?

146
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,860
- 我需要你去给霍华德道... - 滚出去
- I need you to apologize to How... - Get out.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,420
行行好吧 沃尔伍兹不肯出来 我们的机器人大战需要他呀
Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.

148
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,860
那让机器人找他去
Well,then have the robot go and get him.

149
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,540
机器人又没伤他自尊
The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

150
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,550
他就是欠骂
His feelings needed to be hurt.

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,310
他躺在床上两天了
He's been in bed for two days.

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,120
那也好 可能是和充气娃娃玩呢
Yeah,probably with a blow-up doll.

153
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,800
他没有和...
He's not with a...

154
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,730
他和谁在一起玩真的重要吗?
Does it really matter who or what he's with?

155
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,390
那家伙崩溃了
The guy is devastated.

156
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,980
请问 我怎么可能把霍华德弄崩溃?
Oh,please,how could I possibly devastate Howard?

157
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,420
好吧 我不是批评你
Okay,don't take this as a criticism,

158
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,550
但你有时会发生暴露在致命的 伽马射线之下那种状况
but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.

159
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,120
那啥意思?
What does that mean?

160
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,120
比如 大多数时候 你是和气的你
You know,like,most of the time,you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

161
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,000
但当你生气时 就好像变成了...
but then,when you get angry,you kind of turn into,like,you know...

162
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,460
成熊了?
I turn into a bear?

163
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,830
不是吧? 伽马射线? 你?
Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?

164
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,460
这都联想不到绿巨人?
You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that?

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,700
没关系 只是请你去和他谈谈
Never mind. Just,please go talk to him.

166
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,790
说啥呀? 说我并不是那个意思 可我就是那个意思呀
And say what? That I didn't mean it,because I meant it.

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,310
也许你可以从另外一个角度来谈 比如 嗯
Well,maybe you can go at it from a different angle,like,um,

168
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,760
你在他身上看到善良的闪光点 你那天那么说只是
you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said

169
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,680
因为你想鼓舞它 让它放大闪光
because you want to nurture it and make it shine.

170
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,090
好吧 试试这个方法呢
Okay,let's try it this way.

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,520
还记得我们邂逅那天
Remember the day that we first met

172
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,230
你让我去你男朋友家里 替你把电视要回来
and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back

173
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,880
他有九英尺高 把我裤子都扒了 然后你说...
and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said...

174
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,620
什么来着? 你说什么来着?
What was that? What did you say?

175
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,090
噢 对了 你说你欠我个人情
Oh,yes. You said you owed me one.

176
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,710
嗷 得了吧 这不公平
Okay,come on,that's not fair.

177
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,690
我没穿裤子就回家了
I came home with no pants.

178
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,190
得 我明天去一趟
Fine,I'll go over there tomorrow.

179
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,550
多谢
Thank you.

180
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,280
我该提醒你 要当心他妈妈
I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.

181
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,950
她怎么了?
What about her?

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,780
她是个讨喜的人 你会爱上她的
She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,200
霍华德 有个叫帕西的金发女郎来找你!
Howard,there's a blonde girl,Patsy,here to see you!

184
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,170
谁?
Who?

185
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,260
噢 这回她又说自己叫佩妮
Okay,now she's saying it's Penny.

186
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,830
我不想同她说话
I don't want to talk to her.

187
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,060
妈!
Ma!

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
她径自跑了过去
She ran past me.

189
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,670
我应该把她扑倒?
Was I supposed to tackle her?

190
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,780
呃 我只是过来看看你怎么样了
So,I just came by to see how you were doing.

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,390
我没事
I'm fine.

192
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,490
很好 你妈妈看上去不错
Good. Your mom seems nice.

193
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,620
她坐公车的时候 别人都离她远远的
People move away from her on the bus.

194
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,610
有何贵干?
What do you want?

195
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,260
好 听着 霍华德 我是来道歉的
Okay,look. Howard,I just want to apologize.

196
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,850
为我说的一些话道歉
For some things that I have said.

197
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,810
关于你的话
About you.

198
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,720
有人告诉我说你也是有感情的
I've been informed that you have feelings.

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,770
而显而易见的是 我伤害了它们
And apparently,I have hurt them.

200
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,510
所以 我很抱歉
So,I'm sorry.

201
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,850
霍华德
Howard.

202
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,780
好 你很抱歉 再见了
Fine. You're sorry. Good-bye.

203
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,540
那么... 你还好吧?
So... you're okay?

204
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,320
嘿 我是个大男孩
Hey,I'm a big boy.

205
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,950
我不会因为某个女人的 随意评论而受创伤的
I'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman.

206
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,390
我是说 你别臭美了
I mean,get over yourself.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,220
好 那么 再见了
Okay. Well,bye.

208
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,730
就差一点儿
So close.

209
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,220
噢 我的天呐 那是克里帕奇的机器人?
Oh,my God. That's Kripke's robot?

210
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,100
如你所见 克里骇人正把这辆 雪佛兰跑车史得粉碎
As you can see,the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.

211
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,790
我不能再看下去了
I can't watch anymore.

212
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,360
谢尔顿 我们得叫停它
Sheldon,we have to call it off.

213
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,840
没有这个选项
We don't have that option.

214
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,110
我们接受了挑战
We've accepted the challenge.

215
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,560
我们不能临阵退缩
We can't run away from a fight.

216
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,590
噢 得了吧 我们不是一直 都在临阵退缩么
Oh,please,we've spent our whole lives running away from fights.

217
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,920
个人而言 我都能从比我小一半的 篱笆墙当中找个洞钻过去
Personally,I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.

218
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,450
你说的可能没错 但猛械可不是我们
Impressive as that may be,Monte is not us.

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,600
猛械无所畏惧
Monte has no fear.

220
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,960
谢尔顿 难道我们看的不是同一个录像?
Sheldon,did we all not just watch the same video?

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,060
克里帕奇的机器人刚刚虐完一辆中型汽车
Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.

222
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,340
但你忽视了一个事实 我们已经对敌人了如指掌
You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against

223
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,900
所以我们可以改装猛械 让他做好迎战的准备
and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,260
你想让他做好准备?
You want to prepare him?

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,910
给他装个膀胱再穿条短裤 他就可以吓得尿裤子了
Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.

226
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,110
抱歉 不过没有沃尔伍兹 我们怎么进行改装?
Excuse me,but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz?

227
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,750
- 佩妮那有信了没? - 还没
- Have you heard from Penny yet? - Not yet.

228
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,400
打起自信来 先生们 我们不需要沃尔伍兹帮忙
Have faith,gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz.

229
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,310
工程学只是物理学 发育迟缓的小弟罢了
Engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics.

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,080
瞧好了 学着点
Watch and learn.

231
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,090
你们俩有谁知道怎么开工具箱么?
Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?

232
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,650
之后 在我十四岁的时候 我遇见了马尔西·格罗斯曼
And then,when I was 14,I met Marcy Grossman.

233
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,570
她是拉摸美丽
She was so beautiful.

234
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,280
她刚摘掉牙套 但还是有点龅牙
She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite.

235
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,160
真是火辣
It was so hot.

236
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,880
就像只性感的小花栗鼠
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

237
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,100
我没有勇气约她出来
I didn't have the courage to ask her out,

238
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,660
但我在初三的才艺表演上 给她献了一首歌
but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.

239
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,190
喔 真贴心
Aw,that sounds sweet.

240
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,710
* 马尔西·格罗斯曼就是阴天的 *
* Marcy Grossman is sunshine *

241
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,420
* 一缕阳光 *
* On a cloudy day *

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,200
* 在天寒地冻时 *
* When it's cold outside *

243
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,080
* 马尔西·格罗斯曼就是那热情的五月 *
* Marcy Grossman is the month of May *

244
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,200
噢 真是可爱
Oh,it's cute.

245
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,700
* 我猜你会说 *
* I guess you'd say *

246
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,230
* 什么才能让我有这种感觉 *
* What can make me feel this way *

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,800
* 马尔西·格罗斯曼,马尔西·格罗斯曼,马尔西·格罗斯曼 *
* Marcy Grossman,Marcy Grossman,Marcy Grossman *

248
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,300
- * 谈论着马尔西 * - 真棒
* Talkin' 'bout Marcy * That's great.

249
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,190
* 格罗斯曼 *
* Grossman.*

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,590
噢 真有意思
Oh,it's fun.

251
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,110
然后她撅着那张性感的花栗鼠小嘴
And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth

252
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,580
朝我头发上淬了口唾沫
and spit in my hair.

253
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,140
之后就是高一的事了
Which brings us to tenth grade.

254
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,760
霍华德 你觉不觉得有时 自己太心急太过火了?
Howard,do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?

255
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,890
看看我嘛
Look at me.

256
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,860
太心急太过火 我怎么可能会有机会?
What chance do I have if I don't try too hard?

257
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,220
这... 你的机会大大的有
Well... you'd have a terrific chance.

258
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,990
你聪明风趣 又有份好工作
I mean,you're smart,you're funny. You have a cool job.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,870
你做那个飞到外太空的东西
You build stuff that goes into outer space.

260
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,780
也是啊
I guess.

261
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,070
跟你说哦 我认识你也有一年半了
Look,I'm telling you,I've known you for,like,a year and a half

262
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,250
这次我才觉得我是在跟你真人讲话
and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person.

263
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,810
而且你知道不 我喜欢他 他人不错
And you know what? I like him. He's a nice guy.

264
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,440
你真的这么想的?
You really think so?

265
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,520
是啊
Yes.

266
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,830
这我还真的不知道
I don't know.

267
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,040
我知道
I do.

268
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,590
你这小机器人不错嘛
Nice little bot you've got here.

269
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,560
这我知道
I'm aware.

270
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,210
- 这是干嘛用的? 转齿? - 对 3400转每分钟
- What's this do,spin? - Yep. At 3400 RPM.

271
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,220
它切钢就像切橡皮一样
It can cut through steel like it was wubber.

272
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,290
赞
Neat.

273
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,420
做得不错
Good work.

274
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,540
谢尔顿 我们要赶快取消
Sheldon,we've got to call this off.

275
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,860
不要 莱纳德
No,Leonard.

276
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,690
多少年了 像克里帕奇一样的无良恶霸 让我的生活悲惨不堪
For years,merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies

277
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,380
抓住手臂来回扭以产生剧痛
既被痛打又受尽凌辱 还有印第安刑
and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns.

278
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,790
这些就此打住!
That stops now.

279
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,140
可是谢尔顿 我们没可能的
But,Sheldon,we don't have a chance.

280
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,980
你现在能给这机器人改进的 就是给它遥控器换块新电池
The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.

281
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,470
你没发觉的是克里帕奇有一个致命伤
What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

282
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,950
他对机器人大体积超能量的过度自信
overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.

283
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,010
那不是过度自信 那叫观察
That's not overconfidence. That's observation.

284
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,390
信我 克里帕奇很快就会倒在 我的心理战上的 观察吧
Trust me,Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe.

285
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,080
克里帕奇
Kripke.

286
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,400
我想问下你的机器人准备好见它制作人没 不过既然你是他的制作人了
I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker,but as you are its maker,

287
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,280
很明显你们是见过面了
clearly the two of you have met.

288
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,480
他脑子怎么鸟?
What is his pwoblem?

289
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,950
学绝地武士心理战还差得远 伙计
Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks,dude.

290
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,680
我只是想确认下我们说好了
I just want to make sure that we're all clear.

291
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,650
按照标准机器人格斗联盟规则
Standard robotic fighting league rules apply.

292
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,300
你是疯了不成? 这是个街战
Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight.

293
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,480
街战哪有什么规则的?
The stweet has no rules.

294
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,010
他说得对 莱纳德 一直到死为直
He's right,Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.

295
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,250
不过我现在给你们个机会承认 我是比你们优越
I will,however,give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now

296
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,680
然后把你的机器人给我当战利品
and offer me your robot as the spoils of war.

297
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,180
永远都没可能!
Never.

298
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,520
我宁愿猛械死都不要落到你手里
I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.

299
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,110
那真是小菜一碟
That could be easily arranged.

300
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,800
各就各位准备开始?
Ready,set,go?

301
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,060
来吧
Do it.

302
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,440
那好吧 预备 开始
All right then. Weady. Set. Go.

303
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,550
来吧 谢尔顿 你可以的
Come on,Sheldon,you got this.

304
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,960
当然 我们做好了万全准备 他怎么对我们都不怕
Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.

305
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,490
这招是新的
That's new.

306
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,030
- 逃啊 猛械! 逃! - 闪啊 Mont!
- Run,Monte,run! - Go,Monte!

307
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,140
- 猛械! - 跑! 跑! 跑! 跑!
- Monte! - Go,go,go,go!

308
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,110
别伤害我们! 别伤害我们! 别伤害我们!
Don't hurt us,don't hurt us,don't hurt us!

309
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,680
好了 弥补儿时心灵创伤就到此为止了
Well,so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.

310
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,570
是我干的
I did this.

311
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,870
猛械被杀都是因为我的傲慢跟自大
Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride.

312
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,190
不管别人怎么说 这都是我的错
No matter what anybody says,this is my fault.

313
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,710
又没人在跟你争
No one's arguing with you,dude.

314
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,150
我收到你短信了 它有多烂... 噢
I got your text. How bad is... Oy.

315
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,810
先别管那机器人了 你是怎么了?
Forget the robot. What happened to you?

316
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,470
他不小心滑倒了
He slipped and fell.

317
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,560
是 我不小心滑倒了 还是在浴室里
Yes,I slipped and fell. In the bathroom.

318
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,520
被浴缸弹起来了
Bounced right off the tub.

319
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,690
对 现在他知道了 如果他不尊重浴缸的话 浴缸会给他好看的
Yes,now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.

320
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,640
那是
Yeah.

321
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,030
趁你闭眼时就给你一拳
They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.

322
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,160
你觉得怎样 霍华德?
So what do you think,Howard?

323
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,750
也不算很烂 对吧?
It's not that bad,right?

324
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,700
噢 不算 用点电线包布 一些焊剂... 你是疯了还是怎样?!
Oh,no. A little electrical tape,some solder... Are you insane?

325
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,980
太空探测器坠毁在沙漠都比这死相好看
I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.

326
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,740
你说得对 猛械走了
You're right. Monte's gone.

327
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,570
我们明早去埋了它 做个简单的仪式 我来主持
We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

328
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,520
莱纳德 你要拉你的大提琴
Leonard,you'll play your cello.

329
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,840
谢尔顿 亲爱的 你是不是有点走火入魔了?
Sheldon,honey,aren't you getting a little carried away?

330
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,850
我是说 这不就是个机器人嘛
I mean,it's just a toy robot.

331
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,250
不就是个机器人嘛?
Just a toy robot?

332
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,590
佩妮
Penny.

333
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,970
我知道了 这就去
I know,I got it.

334
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,390
谢尔顿 对不起
Sheldon,I'm sorry.

335
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,910
别以为我吃亏了
Well,don't get the wrong idea.

336
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,170
在我看来 她很快就会因为同情 然后跟我做爱了
The way I see it,I'm halfway to pity sex.
