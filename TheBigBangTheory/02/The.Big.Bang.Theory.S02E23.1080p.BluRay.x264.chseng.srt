1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,880
老天爷啊
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,580
干嘛
What?

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,680
我无法在不违法协议的情况下 批评你的作品
I can't comment without violating our agreement that i'll not criticize your work.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,410
那你还说"老天爷"
Then what was "Oh, boy"?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,710
我已经相当克制自己了
Great restraint on my part.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,310
我的科学研究没有问题
There's nothing wrong with the science here.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,750
你所谓的"科学研究"  跟我的相比
Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,080
相差甚远吧
when you say, "Science."

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,150
这样呢
Okay, how's that?

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,910
其实刚刚的才是对的
You actually had it right in the first place.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,710
你又掉进我的 经典恶作剧陷阱了
Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,850
气死你
Bazinga!

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,610
收到一封很怪的邮件
Now here's a peculiar e-mail.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,980
大学校长要我明天早上8点
The president of the university wants me to meet him

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,110
去他办公室见他
at his office tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,110
-为什么  -没说
- Why? - It doesn't say.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,950
肯定是紧急事件
It must be an emergency.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,650
大学里的人都知道  我8点吃早餐
Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8:00

19
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,210
8点20肠胃开始消化
and move my bowels at 8:20.

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,410
没用啁啾鸟网站前过的是什么日子
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
明天早上就知道什么事了
I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,710
还要14个小时呢
That's 14 hours away.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,110
接下来840分钟
For the next 840 minutes,

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,550
我会像海森堡的粒子
I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles;

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,050
只知道自己的地点或移动速度
I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going,

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,210
但却不能同时知道两者
but I can't know both.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,950
那我怎么受得了
Yet how am I supposed to carry on

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,980
这些恼人的东西老在我脑子里乱转
with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,880
我很清楚这种感觉
Yeah, I know the feeling.

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,210
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第23集（本季终）

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,310
莱纳德
Leonard? Leonard?

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,080
莱纳德
Leonard?

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,910
谢尔顿  现在是早上2点啊
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

34
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,480
怎么每个人都跟我说现在几点
Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,580
每个人
Everybody?

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,610
你  大学校长 还有他妻子
You, the president of the university, his wife,

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,440
他们气急败坏的女儿
their sullen teenage daughter.

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,910
他们全家都对现在几点 别人知不知道很感兴趣
That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,180
你居然在半夜跑去 塞伯特校长家
You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,010
他没回复我的邮件
He didn't respond to my e-mail,

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
我又不知道他的电话
his phone number is unlisted.

42
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,880
那我还能怎么办
Tell me what my other option was.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,280
你可以等到早上啊
You could have waited until morning.

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,780
对  对于你是不可能
I know, look who I'm talking to.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,580
你还记得我向
Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,410
国家科学基金会提交的 申请去北极勘测
to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,210
慢速磁单极子的申请吗
at the magnetic North Pole?

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,080
一天不记都不行呢
Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.

49
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,780
你真好
Aw, how nice.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
基金会的北极考察队员
Well, a space opened up

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,780
确定最后一刻  空出了空位
at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
等等
Wait a minute.

53
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,140
他批准让你去北极
He offered to send you to the North Pole?

54
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,310
对
Yes.

55
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,440
他还相当热情呢
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

56
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,740
他说"坦白说"
He said, "Frankly,

57
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,410
"我巴不得今晚就送你去"
if I could send you tonight, I would."

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,710
那你想去吗
Okay, well, do you want to go?

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
当然不想
Of course not.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,210
我是理论物理学家
I'm a theoretical physicist.

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,510
我选这个职业完全出于能在家办公
A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors,

62
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,440
但如果我能在北极 勘测出慢速磁单极子
but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,

63
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,210
我就能成为证明弦理论的科学家
I will be the scientis to confirm string theory.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
人们会写书赞扬我
People will write books about me.

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,740
三年级学生会做意粉画 描绘我的一生呢
Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,410
当然  说不定画个我揍死你的场景
Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,080
冷嘲热讽?
Sarcasm?

68
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,780
有可能
Maybe.

69
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,980
真叫人难以取舍
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,910
你能想象我  谢尔顿·库珀  在北极吗
Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?

71
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,010
小菜一碟  我现在就想着呢
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
但我怕冷啊  莱纳德
I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

73
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,380
我们都多少次因为我喝冰吸太快
How often have we had to leave a movie theater

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,540
结果头疼
because I got a headache

75
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,240
提前离开电影院了
from drinking the Icee too fast?

76
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,340
我不能去
I can't go.

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,540
那就别去
Well, then don't go.

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,010
你怎么能这么说
How can you say that?

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,140
难得的科学机遇就在眼前
The scientific opportunity of a lifetime

80
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,480
我最好的朋友却让我不要去
presents itself and my best friend says "Don't go."

81
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,710
那就去呗
All right, then go.

82
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,080
听听你说的话
Listen to you.

83
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,440
我怎么去啊
How can I possibly go?

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,910
谢尔顿  我到底要说什么
Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,540
才能结束这个话题  让我回去睡觉
to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?

86
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,610
真奇怪  塞伯特校长也这么问我
Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,610
结果呢
How was it resolved?

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,310
没结果  她妻子放狗咬我 结果没下文了
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.

89
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,760
想象一下  如果他答应了
Just imagine. If he says yes,

90
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,200
我们就能享受整个没谢尔顿的夏天
we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.

91
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,760
我们能去户外玩儿
We could play outside.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,530
我们能坐在沙发左边
We could sit on the left side of the couch.

93
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,430
我能在8点20上厕所
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,060
我们的梦想真渺小啊
Our dreams are very small, aren't they?

95
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,560
好消息  先生们  我暂时接受了
Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted...

96
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,130
好耶
Yeah!

97
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,660
加入北极考察队的邀请
...the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.

98
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,200
-没有你怎么行  -祝马到成功
- It's not gonna be the same without you. - Godspeed.

99
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,070
谢谢 但别高兴得太早
Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,670
我有不祥的预感
Ooh, I don't like where this is going.

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,540
我正式提议
I would like to propose...

102
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,210
你们三个和我一起去
that the three of you accompany me.

103
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,570
去北极?
To the North Pole?

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,870
是滴
Yes.

105
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,210
是为了确保你走后 我们不会碰你的东西么
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?

106
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,910
我承认我是有此顾虑
I'll admit that was a concern.

107
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,040
但事实是
But the fact is,

108
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,710
我需要一个团队协助我
I'll need a support team.

109
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,970
你们三个呢
And the three of you

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
是我的最佳人选
are my first choice.

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,790
真的
Really?

112
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,840
的确有很多人比你们更加够格
Well, there are others who might be more qualified,

113
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
但一想到要面试他们我就胃疼
but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomachache.

114
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,840
我知道这个提议比较重大
Now, I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking,

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,640
你们花几分钟讨论一下吧
so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?

116
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,740
我们不会真要和他
We're not really gonna go to the North Pole

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,940
跑去北极吧
with him, are we?

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
我现在还能听得到
I'm still within earshot!

119
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,700
你们得等我把门关上
You may want to wait for my door to close.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,470
我们不会真要和他
We're not really gonna go

121
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,470
跑去北极吧
to the North Pole with him, are we?

122
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,140
等下  咱们想想
Hang on. Let's talk about it.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,670
这是国家科学基金探险项目
This is a National Science Foundation expedition.

124
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,700
咱们怎么能拒绝呢
I don't know how we can turn it down.

125
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,800
简单  不是说我们不想参加基金探险项目
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"

126
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,040
而是我们不想花
say, "No, we don't want to spend

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,800
跟一个疯子杵在北极圈的小木屋里
"three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle

128
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,940
长达三个月
with an anal nutbag."

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,500
但如果我们能成为证实弦理论团队的一员
But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory,

130
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,800
我们就能去任何大学城的酒吧免费喝酒
we could drink for free in any bar in any college town

131
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,800
只要那个大学有比较强的科学研究组织
with a university that has a strong science program.

132
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,200
霍华德  这可是重大科研项目
Howard, this is big science.

133
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,240
你可以成为那个组建仪器的工程师
You could be the engineer who builds the equipment

134
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,100
我们能因此上杂志封面呢
that puts us on the cover of magazines.

135
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,300
我也可以成为那个造出一把弩弓
I could also be the engineer

136
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,370
用来射杀谢尔顿的工程师
who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

137
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,140
你仍然可能因此上杂志
You still might get on a magazine.

138
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,470
你们俩真的慎重考虑过了
So you guys are seriously considering this?

139
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,070
-是的  -你们觉得能受得了谢尔顿
- Yes. - And you think you can put up with Sheldon?

140
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,970
我是印度人嘛
Well, I'm a Hindu.

141
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,700
我的信仰告诉我  今生的苦难
My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life

142
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,400
来世将转为福音
we are rewarded in the next.

143
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,640
和谢尔顿在北极历练三个月
Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon,

144
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,470
我能重生成一个身材火爆又会飞的亿万富翁
and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!

145
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,700
先生们  做出决定了么
Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?

146
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,240
我加入
I'm in.

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,870
我也加入
Me, too.

148
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,840
晕死  给我压力  从了
Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

149
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,400
很好
Excellent.

150
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,500
友情提示下
Just an FYI,

151
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,200
既然我是考察队的队长
as I am the expedition's team leader,

152
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,230
按规定你应该说"好的  队长"
protocol dictates that be phrased, "Fine, sir."

153
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
不过别担心
But don't worry,

154
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,270
会有新生培训的
there will be a briefing.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,410
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

163
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,410
佩妮
Penny!

164
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,410
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

165
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,410
佩妮
Penny!

166
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,850
你要干嘛
What do you want?

167
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,650
我想进入芝士蛋糕厂的步入式冷藏室
I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.

168
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,010
亲爱的  我说过了
Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger

169
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,380
汉堡的肉饼是冷鲜保存的
meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.

170
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,780
不  这回是为了三个月的北极考察训练
No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.

171
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,950
什么
What?

172
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,150
我不知道这句话 哪里让你听不懂了
I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you...

173
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,650
说详细点  我将和莱纳德  沃罗威茨  库萨帕里
but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle

174
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,510
一切去北极圈
with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

175
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,710
你们都去
You're all going?

176
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,350
-是的  -去三个月
- Yes. - For three months?

177
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,050
是的
Yes.

178
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,510
不好意思
Excuse me.

179
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,950
冷藏室的事你到底是同意还是不同意啊
Is that a yes or a no on the freezer?

180
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,180
这女人的注意力跟小虫虫差不多
The woman has the attention span of a gnat.

181
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,980
-嗨  莱纳德  -嗨
- Hey, Leonard. - Hey.

182
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,050
谢尔顿说你们要去北极
Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole.

183
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,580
是啊  另类吧
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,650
是啊  只是有点惊讶  你没告诉我
Yeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.

185
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,850
事情发生得太快了
Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast.

186
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,550
我们忙着体检  买保暖内衣
And we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear

187
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,550
还得研究下  积雪这些东西
and study up on, you know, snow and stuff.

188
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,580
抱歉  我本来要告诉你的
Sorry, I was gonna tell you.

189
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,580
你不用道歉
Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize.

190
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,310
没有说你必须告诉我
There's no reason you have to tell me.

191
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,050
我只不过  有点惊讶罢了
I was just... you know, surprised.

192
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,480
是啊  你很忙
Yes, yes, you were busy,

193
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,750
你很惊讶  激动人心
you were surprised, all very fascinating.

194
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,550
冷藏室的事说到哪了
Now where do we stand on the freezer?

195
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,850
他说真的吗
Is he serious?

196
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,710
事实上  会有帮助的
Actually, it would help.

197
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,480
好吧  我尽量吧
All right, I'll see what I can do.

198
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,010
去北极呆三个月
So, three months at the North Pole.

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,610
真是
Wow, that is...

200
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,350
棒极了
awesome.

201
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,480
是啊
Yeah.

202
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,780
不好意思  你所谓的"尽量"
I'm sorry, but at what point do you put this

203
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,650
到底是什么意思
"see what you can do" plan into action?

204
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,880
给你提个醒  谢尔顿
Just a warning, Sheldon.

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,080
那个冷藏室是从外面锁门的
The freezer locks from the outside.

206
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,180
-你觉得她难过吗  -没有
- She seems upset to you? - No.

207
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,880
-你觉得她难过吗  -没有
- Did she seem upset to you? - No.

208
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,780
很好  我猜对了
Oh, good, I got it right.

209
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,850
你难过吗
Are you upset?

210
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,970
有一点
A little bit.

211
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,780
两击两中  我真厉害
Two for two. I'm on fire.

212
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,310
我知道她不是我的女朋友
I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything,

213
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,350
但是你不觉得我整个夏天都不在
but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad

214
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,450
她会感到些许的难过吗
that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?

215
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,450
感觉像个附加题
That feels like a bonus question.

216
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,740
见好就收啦  我好开心哦
I'm gonna stop here while I'm ahead but I've had a great time.

217
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,640
好了  这次的训练目的
All right, the purpose of this drill

218
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,720
是使我们适应在即将面对的 北极圈内极度寒冷的温度下
is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures

219
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,690
使用各种工具
such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.

220
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,270
你的工具呢
Where are your tools?

221
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,900
就在这里
Right here.

222
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,280
好了  队员们  打开练习工具箱
All right, team, open up your practice kits.

223
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,090
由于校方不允许我
As the university did not permit me

224
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,700
把实际用到的器材带到
to bring the actual equipment we'll be using

225
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,130
蛋糕厂来  因为貌似呢
to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently,

226
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,340
我简直"不可理喻"
I'm "ridiculous,"

227
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,170
我提供的替代器材
I've provided substitutes

228
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,040
将极好地锻炼你们的动手技巧

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,320
莱纳德  你要处理一系列 复杂的数学问题
Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems

230
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,090
使用我在3年级时勇夺 地球科学金牌时获得的

when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade.

要好好待它
Treat it with respect.

on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf.

235

记住了
Now, remember,

236
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,500
短尖髯是没有八字胡的山羊胡
a Van Dyke is a goatee without a mustache.

开始

冻死我了
Oh, son of a bitch!

247
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,920
万事开头难
Adversity is to be expected.

248
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,100
继续
Continue.

249
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,550
靠  这下我要被起诉了

我也做不到
Me either.

252
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,320
先生们  想象一下
Gentlemen, use your imagination.

259
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,870
各位听见啦
You heard the man.

260
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,480
把他摁倒  我来剁开他
Hold him down and I'll cut him open.

261
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,030
等一下  我知道我不具备领导潜质
Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership,

262
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,140
但我不理解为什么不能在考察站
but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment

263
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,010
装配好器材然后再拿出去呢
inside the hut and then take it outside.

264
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,180
我没想到哦
I hadn't thought of that.

265
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,300
训练完毕
I guess we're done here.

热巧克力加一块黄油

为啥
Okay, why?

270
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,860
因为在北极的严寒下
Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic,

271
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,030
我们每天至少要摄入5千卡路里
we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day

272
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,610
来维持自身体重
just to maintain our body weight.

273
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,240
谢尔顿  你明知我不能吃黄油
Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter.

274

早就想到了  那是一块

276
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,230
"难以置信  居然不含黄油"[人造奶油]
"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" stick.

277
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,030
妈咪  但是别人都要去北极
But mammy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.

278
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,340
我不管别人做什么
I don't care what the other guys are doing.

279
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,190
如果他们想要跳孟加拉湾 游泳去斯里兰卡
If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,

280
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,170
你也跟着去吗
would you follow them?

281
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,280
你在我身后唠叨的话  我就跳
If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.

282
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,530
别跟你母亲顶嘴
Don't talk back to your mother.

283
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,190
这个太危险了  拉杰
This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.

284
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,990
不是的
No, it's not.

285
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,110
霍华德  告诉他们
Howard, tell them.

286
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,790
库萨帕里医生和夫人  你们好
Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

287
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,190
我能理解你们的担心
I understand your concern,

288
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,210
如果能让你们感觉好一点 连我母亲都同意让我去呢
but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going,

289
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,380
她可是直到我17岁 才把我床上的安全栏拿掉
and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.

290
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,220
她不关心她儿子 会不会被海象吃掉?
So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?

291
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,020
这不可能  库萨帕里夫人
That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

292
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,330
如果拉杰死了
If Raj dies,

293
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,260
也只会因为冻伤  坏疽  严重晒伤
it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn

294
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,200
或者被1500磅重的北极熊撕成碎片
or being ripped to shreds by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

295
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,160
妈妈  我把你接到免提上 跟拉杰的父母通话
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents.

296
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,200
您能告诉他们 您同意我去北极吗
Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?

297
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,420
北极
Arctic?!

298
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,230
我以为你说的是阿肯色州
I thought you said Arkansas!

299
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,880
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

300
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,260
你从来都不仔细听
You never listen to me!

301
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,330
他什么都不告诉我
He doesn't tell me anything!

302
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,470
他就知道自惭形秽  苟且偷生
He lives a secret life because he's ashamed!

303
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,730
莱纳德  能跟你谈谈吗
Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?

304
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,490
当然  去外面说吧 那里少一些尖叫和罪恶
Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt.

305
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,300
怎么了
What's up?

306
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,760
我给你准备了一份送别礼物
Well, I got you a little going away present.

307
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,570
毯子啊
Oh, a blanket.

308
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,080
不对  不只是毯子
Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket.

309
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,960
看见没  还有袖子呢
See, it has sleeves.

310
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,980
这样你就能蜷在里面
So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up

311
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
搞你的科研了
while you do your science stuff.

312
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,200
酷啊
Oh, wow, cool.

313
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,600
我会想你的
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

314
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,190
-回见  -再见
- See you later. - Bye.

315
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,340
跟你说了  没有
I told you no!

316
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,780
为什么不信我
Why don't you believe me?

317
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,640
因为我无法理解
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me!

318
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,670
印度这么大一个国家
How can it be that in the entire country of India,

319
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,200
怎么会连一家澳美客牛排坊都没有
there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?!

320
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,350
谢尔顿  谢尔顿
Sheldon... Sheldon?

321
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,720
奶奶  我要吃饼干
I want a cookie, Meemaw.

322
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,390
谢尔顿  是我
Sheldon, it's me.

323
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,930
但是奶奶刚刚做了饼干
But Meemaw just made cookies.

324
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,600
我不知道该不该参加这次科考
Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.

325
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,060
什么
What?

326
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,840
我觉得我不能去北极
I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

327
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,640
莱纳德
Okay, Leonard,

328
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,640
我明白 你怕我会失望
I know you're concerned about disappointing me

329
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,230
但我希望你能得到些许安慰
but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge

330
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,680
我对你的期望值其实非常低
that my expectations of you are very low.

331
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,670
确实很安慰人
Yeah, that's very comforting.

332
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,540
安慰队员是领导的职务
Comforting is a part of leadership.

333
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,690
我虽不在意  但仍然是我的负担
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.

334
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,510
不错  只是我觉得佩妮不想让我走
Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.

335
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,750
假设这是不去的正当理由  实际上不是
Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't,

336
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,970
你怎么知道呢 是她说的么
how do you know this? Did she say it?

337
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,780
不完全是吧
Not exactly.

338
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,660
但是她说她会想我  还送这个给我
But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.

339
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,960
什么东西
What is it?

340
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,340
带袖子的毛毯
It's a blanket with sleeves.

341
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,430
真聪明的设计
Oh, that's clever.

342
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,080
看看我是否正确理解了
Let me see if I understand this correctly.

343
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,370
她想念你  是你非常向往的 情感状态
Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?

344
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,610
-当然啦  -那行
- Yes, obviously. - All right.

345
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,460
但是她想念你是建立在你要离开的基础上的
Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving,

346
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,000
从逻辑上讲  你必须去
logic dictates you must leave.

347
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,270
话虽如此  但这一去就是三个月啊
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months.

348
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,330
要是她不再想我了  另觅新欢怎么办
What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?

349
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,310
她的注意广度[注意力集中时长]确实比较短
She does have a short attention span.

350
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,550
所以说  我不能去
So, I can't go.

351
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,790
莱纳德  也许你是对的
Leonard, you may be right.

352
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,630
看来佩妮暗中表现出
It appears that Penny secretly wants you

353
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,790
想跟你发生亲密肉体接触的欲望
in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.

354
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,920
你真的这样想?
You really think so?

355
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,660
当然不是
Of course not.

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,130
即使处于失眠状态  我都可以
Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to

357
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,350
成功上演另一出经典恶作剧
pull off another one of my classic pranks.

358
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,700
气死你
Bazinga!

359
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
莱纳德  几点了
Oh, Leonard, what time is it?

360
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,000
早晨七点  抱歉这么早打扰你
It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early,

361
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
但我们马上就出发了  我想跟你谈谈
but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.

362
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,770
好
Okay.

363
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,390
你说你会想我  是什么意思
What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me?

364
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,510
不知道
Um, I don't know.

365
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,020
你离开了  我会发现嘛
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

366
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,940
那这个呢
Okay, well, um, what about this?

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,320
什么意思
What does this mean?

368
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,870
酗酒  乱刷卡和熬夜看电视 都没啥好处
Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.

369
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,530
好吧
All right, fine.

370
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,470
那个长长的拥抱呢
What about that really long hug?

371
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,610
那又是什么意思
What did that mean?

372
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,080
不算长长的拥抱呀
That wasn't a long hug.

373
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,120
至少持续了五秒钟
It was at least five Mississippis.

374
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,580
一般拥抱不超过两秒钟
A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.

375
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,570
莱纳德  我不知道有什么可说的
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.

376
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,950
就是个拥抱嘛
It was just a hug.

377
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,090
很高兴交待清楚了
Glad we cleared that up.

378
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,620
是啊
Yeah.

379
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,480
后会有期
I guess I'll see you.

380
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,680
一路顺风
Okay, have a safe trip.

381
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,690
谢谢
Thank you.

382
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,800
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Okay, bye.

383
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,390
意思是舍不得你走
It means I wish you weren't going.

384
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,930
该死
Damn it.

385
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,040
怎么了
What?

386
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,120
冰用完了
We're out of ice.

387
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,360
好了  先生们  明早七点整
All right, men, we begin initial assembly

388
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,010
我们开始前期装配
and deployment of the testing equipment

389
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,530
和部署测试仪器
starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,

390
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,070
在那之前的时间  你们自由支配
but until then, you are all off duty.

391
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,150
我建议你们 尽量别捣乱
I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum

392
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,440
因为雪橇救护队要18小时才能到达
as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.

393
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,370
你在搞什么玩意
What are you working on?

394
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,420
弩弓
Crossbow.

395
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,620
伙计们  我能说几句吗
Hey, guys, can I just say something?

396
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,130
我们是不是应该仔细想想
How about we take a moment to think about

397
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,580
我们所在的位置
where we are right now?

398
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,740
这算是 世界之巅了
This is literally the top of the world.

399
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,300
人类历史上只有屈指可数的几位
Only a handful of people in all of human history

400
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,740
能目睹我们看到的景象
will ever see what we are going to see.

401
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,180
他说得对
He's right.

402
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
是啊
Yeah, wow.

403
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,760
相当有纪念意义
It is remarkable.

404
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,320
谁想看电影
So, who's up for a movie?

405
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,680
好主意  看什么呢
Good idea, what do you think?

406
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,130
《大北极》还是约翰·卡朋特的《怪形》
Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter's The Thing?

407
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
双片连映吧
I say double feature.

408
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,060
晚餐好了
Dinner's ready!

409
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,770
吃什么
What are we having?

410
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,300
"再造"泰国菜
Reconstituted Thai food.

411
