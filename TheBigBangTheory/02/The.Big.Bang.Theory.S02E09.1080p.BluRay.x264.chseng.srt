1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,780
佩妮  好啊
Penny, hello.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,840
谢尔顿
Hey, sheldon.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,600
你咋样啊
What is shaking?

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,630
什么
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,510
这是口头语嘛  开场白
It's colloquial, a conversation opener.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,990
你觉得今天天气好吗
So, do you find the weather satisfying?

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,810
我们本地的球队赢球了
Are you currently sharing in the triumph

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,630
你是否为之一振
of some local sports team?

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,260
你搞什么名堂  吓到我了
What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,620
我在跟你闲聊啊
I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,180
咋样
S'up?

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,930
我求你别再说了
Please don't do that.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,010
好吧
All right,

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,330
不过我觉得如果你要和某人
But I'm given to understand that

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,650
谈一个很尴尬的问题之前
when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,040
最好跟他说几句不搭界的闲话
it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,140
就是说刚才那还不算尴尬事了?
So, this wasn't the awkward part?

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,600
不算
No.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,320
那好吧
Oh, all right.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,870
咋了
S'up?

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,660
太好了  我说对了
Oh, good, I used that right.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,560
说正事吧 你应该已经注意到了  莱纳德最近
Anyway, you're aware that leonard has entered into a new

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,920
和一个女人发生了一段带有性关系的感情
Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,440
现在我能感到尴尬了
Okay, feeling the awkward now.

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,550
她的名字是 斯蒂芬妮·巴内特医生
Her name is dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,260
她是弗里蒙特纪念医院一名杰出的外科医生
Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,680
-莱纳德告诉过我了  -很好
Yeah, leonard told me. good.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,470
但他可能没告诉你
What he may have left out is

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,570
这段感情对我来说非常重要
how important this relationship is to me.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,820
对你
To you?

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,470
是的  在那些为数不多的和莱纳德约会过的女人中
Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with,

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,180
只有她还算像个人
She's the only one I have ever found tolerable.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,010
那我呢
Well, what about me?

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,890
这应该是不言自明的
The statement stands for itself.

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,660
你嘴好甜
Well, aren't you sweet?

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,180
而且你应该多和她接触一下
Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,970
好让她别感觉到你是她的性竞争对手
It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

38
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,050
我看她没什么好担心的
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,710
你现在是这么说  但看看这样的情况
You say that now, but consider the following senario

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,870
漆黑的晚上
you're sitting in your apartment,

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,550
你孤身一人坐在家里
It's late, you're alone.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,200
你的下丘脑里正游走着雌激素
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and

43
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,220
和孕激素  这时突然在你眼里
Progesterone and suddenly even

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,630
就算莱纳德也会是一名有生育能力的性对象
Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,950
或者说  配对
Or a, uh, "hookup"

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,270
现在的都市青年好像都这么说的
As it's referred to by today's urban youth.

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,160
-真的吗  -是的
Really? yes.

48
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,350
如果万一发生这种情况
Now, should that happen,

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,730
我要求你找到一种压制自己性冲动的办法
I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,020
只需要想你就可以了
I could think about you.

51
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,910
好  只要管用就行
Fine, whatever works.

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,650
和你交谈总是很愉快  谢尔顿
Always nice talking to you, sheldon.

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,610
再见[谢尔顿在刻意模仿黑人俚语]
Uh, peace out!

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,520
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第09集

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,600
今晚多么美好啊
Well, this is very pleasant.

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,020
很高兴你喜欢
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

57
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,080
你还说通心粉三个人吃不够呢
And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
我错了
I stand corrected.

59
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,360
你们知道么  意大利的家庭主妇都有这样一种经验
You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb.

60
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,360
只要抓一把直径为一英寸的通心粉放在锅里烧
A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is

61
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,450
就足够所有人吃的了  因为它在加热之后会膨胀一倍
Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,720
非常有趣
That's very interesting.

63
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,390
谢谢
Thank you.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,620
她不是真觉得有趣  只是礼节罢了
She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,550
斯蒂芬妮
Well, stephanie,

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,900
既然莱纳德现在不想谈话
Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,

67
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,470
那么就由我来顶替他
I guess I'll just have to pick it up.

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,450
你有没有现场目击过凶杀
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,860
-没  -好的
No. good.

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,570
你最喜欢什么水果
What's your favorite fruit?

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,340
草莓
Uh, strawberries.

72
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,780
严格来说不算水果  不过也不追究了
Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

73
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,840
你的医学实习是在哪儿做的
Where did you do your medical internship?

74
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,160
劳伦斯纪念医院  在德州的加尔维斯敦
Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas.

75
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,680
真的吗  我就是在那儿出生的
Really? that's where I was born!

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,140
不是吧
You're kidding!

77
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,710
在那所医院里  我度过了不少童年时光
I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,180
我十二岁的时候还坐直升机去哪儿呢
When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,310
怎么了啊
Why, w-w-what happened?

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,830
辐射烧伤
Radiation burns.

81
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,460
我在造X射线轴向分层造影扫描机的时候发生了一点小意外
A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.

82
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,980
你居然尝试自己造一个X射线轴向分层造影扫描机?
I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

83
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,960
我不是尝试  我是成功了
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,910
而且我还用它观察了
In fact, I was briefly able to see

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,350
我姐姐的小豚鼠  雪球的内脏
the inside of my sister's guinea pig,

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
然后他就烧起来了
Snowball, before he caught fire.

87
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,020
所以我们家很流行一句话
It led to an interesting

88
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,480
豚鼠躲不过扫描机
"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner."

89
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,230
谢尔顿
Uh, sheldon?

90
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,830
我离开一下
Excuse me.

91
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,010
我回来之后  为了好玩
When I come back,just for fun,

92
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,750
我们来聊聊架空历史
the subject will be alternative history.

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,350
主题是
Specifically,

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,680
如果林肯是来自于未来的机器人
How would the civil war have gone differently

95
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,580
那么南北战争的局势将会如何不同
If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?

96
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,770
看啊  通心粉我们都吃不掉呢
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,930
你到底知不知道这是一次约会
Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

98
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,170
明白啊
I do.

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,380
你明白么  老实说
Do you? because frankly,

100
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,900
自打我坐下后你就呆若木鸡
you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.

101
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,390
好吧  那我的问题是  你为什么要坐下
Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down?

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,350
帮你呀
To help.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,470
如果你这次又失手了
Look, if you fail at this relationship,

104
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,600
历史证明你会的
and history suggests you will,

105
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,070
那么我们的先头登陆部队所需的
Then we risk losing the medical officer

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,040
军医很可能就没了
That our landing party has always needed.

107
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,370
什么先头登陆部队
What landing party?

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,440
你是寇克  我是史波克  沃罗威茨是史考特
You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty,

109
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,280
库萨帕里是那个总是被杀的
Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed...

110
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,050
现在我们有了麦考伊[《星际迷航》里的人物]
And now we've got mccoy.

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:12,970
所以
So,

112
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,830
我们都站在那看着术后X光片
We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,700
然后就是那个
and there it is,

114
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,670
众目睽睽之下  就在那人的胸腔里
Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,570
有我一只耳环
One of my earrings.

116
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,260
天呐  那你怎么办
Oh, my god, what did you do?

117
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,360
你觉得我还能怎么办
What do you think I did?

118
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,170
我偷偷把另一只耳环给摘了
I discreetly slipped off the other earring,

119
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,950
放在兜里逃离现场
Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!

120
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,900
捉迷藏的奖品捏
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,190
嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, sheldon.

122
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,850
嗨  斯蒂芬妮
Hi, stephanie.

123
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,790
不好意思我迟到了
I'm sorry I'm late,

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
但是你的同伴给我的邀请太难破译了
But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation.

125
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,820
什么邀请
What invitation?

126
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,180
"我们去看电影了"
"we're going to the movies."

127
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,000
啥电影  啥影院  啥时候
What movie? what theater? what time?

128
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,820
如果你想要我追踪不到你
If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you,

129
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,630
那你干得真是再好不过了
You couldn't have done a better job.

130
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,760
明显我可以的
Oh, clearly I could have.

131
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,630
我花了将近20分钟才从你电脑的网页
It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,500
浏览记录里查到你搜索过的电影时刻表
History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.

133
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,200
在这等我  我给咱们找个座
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

134
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,520
不用  我们有位子
Uh, no, we have seats.

135
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,390
不是正确的位子
Not the right seats.

136
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,340
他干嘛呢
What is he doing?

137
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,270
他在找听觉最优点
He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.

138
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,670
他一直都这样吗
Does he always do this?

139
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,990
有时他也会带给玩具木琴
Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.

140
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,160
真是太抱歉了
I am really sorry about this.

141
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,970
不会  还好啦  他挺可爱的
No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,100
不好意思  你们一直都坐对了地方
My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along.

143
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,100
莱纳德  你们能往里错一个位子吗
Leonard, you want to slide over one?

144
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,630
不能  您就坐这吧
No, just sit here.

145
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,600
好极了  就是这感觉
Oh, yeah, this is it.

146
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,610
莱纳德
Leonard.

147
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,150
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard? leonard?!

148
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,530
咋啦  谢尔顿
What, sheldon?

149
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,910
咋啦  谢尔顿  咋啦  谢尔顿
What, sheldon?! what, sheldon?!

150
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,230
告诉我你在这看到什么
Tell me what you see here.

151
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,700
这个钝器能用来杀人吗
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?

152
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,520
这是斯蒂芬妮的facebook网页
This is stephanie's facebook page.

153
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,660
你看  本来应该是"交往中"的  她写的是什么
Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?

154
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,480
"斯蒂芬妮  巴奈特单身"
"stephanie barnett is single."

155
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,410
而且早些时候
Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening,

156
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,250
她送了一只电子羊给一个叫麦克的人
She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike.

157
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,880
谁是麦克
Who's mike?!

158
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,960
为什么他得到一只电子羊而不是你
Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?

159
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,220
这只不过是她的facebook网页罢了
It's just her facebook page and we've

160
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,200
而且我们只约会过几周
Only been going out a couple of weeks.

161
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,260
你还不明白么
You don't see it, do you?

162
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,910
我们就要失去她了
We're losing her.

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,550
好吧  我简而言之
Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you.

164
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,310
你并不在这场恋爱里面
You are not in this relationship.

165
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,740
我在
I am.

166
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,150
也就是说 你对于我和斯蒂芬妮之间
Ergo, you have no say in anything

167
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,880
发生的事没有发言权
that happens between me and stephanie.

168
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,270
恕难从命
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

169
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,790
根据星际战舰总纲领104第一部分
Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a,

170
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,450
你不是合适的人选  我替你指挥
You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,970
总纲领104  第一部分不适用于此情况
General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation.

172
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,580
给我个好的理由为什么不适用
Give me one good reason why not.

173
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,560
因为这不是《星际迷航》
Because this is not startrek

174
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
佩妮
Penny?

175
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,190
佩妮  佩妮
Penny? penny?!

176
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,280
咋啦
What?

177
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,470
这是香蕉面包
This is banana bread.

178
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,580
这是门把手
This is a door knob.

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,850
根据我的理解  主动赠送食物
It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can

180
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,790
可以作为被邀请进屋聊天的敲门砖
Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.

181
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,250
谢尔顿  想进来么
Sheldon, would you like to come in?

182
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,370
那就聊一会吧
I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

183
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,450
你被抢劫啦
Were you robbed?

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,900
没
No.

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,280
你怎么会这么肯定
How can you be sure?

186
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,450
谢尔顿  你想干嘛
Sheldon, what do you want?

187
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,050
我知道你并不会惊讶
I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,

188
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,130
不过莱纳德又要失恋了
But leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

189
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,560
他和斯蒂芬妮出问题了吗
He's having problems with stephanie?

190
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,310
她在网上赠送给随机男性虚拟牲口
She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet.

191
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,670
我需要数据  才能保证他们在一起
If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.

192
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,270
特别是
Specifically,

193
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,540
我要确切地知道莱纳德做了什么
I need to know exactly what leonard did that

194
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,530
让你"性"趣昂然
Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

195
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
什么
What?

196
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,840
还是  都市俚语
Again, urban slang.

197
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,900
我看我用得越来越溜了
In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

198
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,280
"往下来"和"找低处"[俚语中有口交之意]如何
So, what is the "down" and the "low"?

199
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,500
别担心  这完全是保密的
And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so,

200
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,570
你可以自由谈论 其性事的缺陷
You feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

201
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,250
我们从未上过床
We never got to the bedroom.

202
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,030
原因是
Because?

203
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,080
好了  知道吗
Oh, okay, all right, you know what?

204
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,750
我告诉你怎么回事
I'll tell you what happened.

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,650
我们当时年少  十分相爱
We were young, we were very much in love,

206
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,120
但我们只能通过
But we could only communicate through a

207
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,020
我湖边屋的时光穿梭邮箱交流[《看不见的恋人》中情节]
Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

208
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,600
你让我看那电影还不够
It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,

209
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,140
你还用它嘲笑我
But now you mock me with it?

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,830
绅士们  我有个关于约会和恋爱的问题
Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.

211
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,130
你说你已经和他谈过那个了[暗指性]
You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

212
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,640
我还等着有人和我谈那个呢
I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

213
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,410
更重要的是
More to the point,

214
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,480
想办法让莱纳德和斯蒂芬妮继续交往下去
It's about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together.

215
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,750
我认为你做不到
Oh, I don't think you can.

216
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,980
为什么不行
Well, why not?

217
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,370
看看莱纳德的记录
Look at leonard's record.

218
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,260
与乔伊斯·金交往二十七天
27 days with joyce kim.

219
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,580
然后她逃跑回了朝鲜
During which she defected to north korea.

220
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,280
与莱斯利·温克尔嘿咻两次
Two booty calls with leslie winkle.

221
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,150
因此得了个昵称"光速莱纳德"
For which she awarded him the nickname "speed of light leonard."

222
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,490
三次与佩妮共进晚餐
And the three hour dinner with penny.

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,750
如他们没坐下来点蛋奶酥的话
Which would have been two and a half if

224
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
就只能算是两次半
They ordered the souffle when they sat down.

225
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,430
根据几何级数
Based on the geometric progression,

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,960
他和斯蒂芬妮
His relationship with stephanie

227
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,800
在20分钟后就该完蛋了
should have ended after 20 minutes.

228
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,580
我懂如何计算
Yes, I'm aware of the math.

229
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,950
Y等于27天除以12的商
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

230
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,920
问题仍未解决
The issue remains.

231
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,520
我们如何能避免他不可避免的失败
How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?

232
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,940
如你想确保他在斯蒂芬妮的考虑之列
Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie,

233
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,070
最有把握的是宰了这星球上所有别的男性
Your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

234
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,290
我告诉你什么不该做
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

235
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
别怂恿他用那广告上说的
Don't shpritz him with that body spray from the

236
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,240
女人闻到就会宽衣解带的香体喷雾
Commercial where the women undress when they smell it.

237
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,560
一点都没用
That doesn't work at all.

238
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,550
不管你洒了多少
No matter how much you put on.

239
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,880
这就是你们的本事
So, that's all you've got?

240
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,850
天启式的种族灭绝和"别轻信古龙水"
Apocalyptic genocide and "go easy on the cologne"?

241
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,640
-对啊  -是的
Yeah. yes.

242
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,420
佩妮
Penny.

243
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,070
佩妮
Penny?

244
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
什么事
What?

245
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,000
佩妮
Penny?

246
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,050
西葫芦面包
Zucchini bread.

247
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,220
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

248
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,930
我能进去吗
May I come in?

249
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,650
不行
No.

250
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,890
我懂了
I see.

251
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,630
显然
Apparently,

252
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
我之前关于
My earlier inquiry regarding

253
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,240
你和莱纳德的问题越界了
you and leonard crossed some sort of line.

254
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,460
我道歉
I apologize.

255
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,520
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

256
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,610
那我们又可以平等交谈了
So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

257
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,050
-是的  -很好
Yes. great.

258
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,050
新的话题
New topic.

259
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,370
你现在在你月经周期里的哪一天
Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

260
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,280
什么
What?!

261
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,310
我在网上做了些调查
I've been doing some research online,

262
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,340
显然灵长目雌性
and apparently female primates,

263
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,980
猿  黑猩猩  你们
You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

264
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,910
她们觉得她们的配偶
They find their mate more desirable

265
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,820
被另一个雌性追求时  更有吸引力
When he's being courted by another female.

266
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,480
当竞争的雌性在排卵期
Now, This effect is intensified when the rival female

267
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,370
分泌激素时  这种效果更强烈
Is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.

268
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,900
这又回到我最初的问题
Which brings me back to my question.

269
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,870
你在...
Where are you in your--

270
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,170
很显然  我早来了14天
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

271
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,410
我是说要是能治疗黄热病和疟疾
All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,

272
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,550
为何不能治乳糖不耐症
Why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?

273
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,940
莱纳德  撒手别想了
Leonard, you're going to have to let this go.

274
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,920
你吃点乳酪就放屁
You had a little cheese dip, you farted.

275
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,500
我觉得很可爱
I thought it was cute.

276
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,610
斯蒂芬妮
Oh, hi, stephanie.

277
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,380
再来点红酒
Wanna more wine?

278
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,270
好的  反正我今晚又不开车去哪
Yeah, I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

279
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,610
你在干什么
What are you doing?

280
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,730
我特别想吃白芦笋
I have a craving for white asparagus

281
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,810
但显然未能如愿
That apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

282
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,380
失陪一下
Excuse me.

283
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
你到底怎么了
What the hell is wrong with you?

284
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,700
我在帮你留住斯蒂芬妮
I'm helping you with stephanie.

285
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,080
通过像便秘的驼鹿一样叫唤
By making constipated moose sounds?

286
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,600
当我没打开这瓶盖  而你打开了
When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,

287
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,730
这样你就像个男子汉
It will establish you as the "alpha" male.

288
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,780
你知道吗
You see...

289
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,810
当女性看到你在展示力量时
When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,

290
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,600
她会产生荷尔蒙催产素
She produces the hormone oxytocin.

291
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,650
之后如果你们俩交往的话
If the two of you then engage in intercourse,

292
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,220
它会在大脑促生生物化学反应
This will create the biochemical reaction in the brain

293
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,230
让人们想当然地以为自己陷入爱河
Which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love."

294
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,470
那我给你脸一拳管用吗
Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

295
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,510
当然可以  但还是让我们看看这个行吗
Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.

296
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,440
莱纳德  我不够强壮  还是你来吧
I'm not strong enough, leonard, you'll have to do it.

297
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,770
看在上帝的份上
Oh, for god's sakes.

298
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,460
开吧  已经松动了
Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

299
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,980
需要帮助吗
Do you want some help with that?

300
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,910
不要  不要  我能搞定
No, no, no, I got it.

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,400
没错  没错  他能搞定  这不足为奇
No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising.

302
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,220
很久以前  当我陷入爱河的时候
This is something I long ago came to

303
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,570
我是可以打开的
Peace with in my role as the beta male.

304
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,570
快开
Open it.

305
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,920
-天呢  你还好吗  -我不好
- Oh, my god, are you okay? - no, I'm not.

306
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,870
流血了
I'm bleeding.

307
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,590
像个角斗士一样
Like a gladiator!

308
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,440
你得缝几针
Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.

309
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,450
缝几针  用针缝吗
Stitches? with a needle?

310
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,800
对  就几针
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

311
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,340
好的  稍等一下
Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

312
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,550
顺便一提  我正在那解冻牛排呢
Fyi, I was defrosting a steak in there.

313
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,190
斯蒂芬尼缝得可真漂亮
What a beautiful job stephanie did.

314
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,070
我会用床垫缝纫法
I might have gone with a mattress suture

315
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,390
而不会用毯边锁缝纫法
instead of a blanket stitch,

316
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,210
但她缝成这样  你也只能认了
But you can't argue with her results.

317
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,460
没留伤疤真是太可惜了
It's a shame it won't scar.

318
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,100
战伤可是古时男子汉的荣誉徽章
The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

319
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,280
你什么时候能安静一会
I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.

320
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,230
言归正传
Just for the record,

321
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,220
我费心费力把你打造成男子汉
My efforts to establish you as the alpha

322
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,620
你这么痛哭流涕可没啥帮助
Male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

323
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,990
我没痛哭流涕  只是眼睛湿润了一下而已
I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,410
湿润了一下
Watery?

325
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,510
她用针刺我的手
She stuck a needle into my hand!

326
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,930
我的小泪孩怎么样了
Hey, how's my big cry baby?

327
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,800
我没哭
I didn't cry.

328
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,630
好吧  我只是在逗你
Okay, I'm just teasing you.

329
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,230
不过  你确实哭了
But, yeah, you did.

330
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,950
好的  没问题了
Okay, it's all good.

331
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,850
我们送你回家  扶你上床怎么样
What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?

332
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,200
那你还在那过夜吗
Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

333
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,900
不行  我想你需要休息
Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

334
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,630
她说得对  你呕吐的时候
She's right. as long as you're vomiting,

335
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,680
交媾是禁忌的
coitus is contra-indicated.

336
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,110
谢谢你  库珀博士
Thank you, dr. cooper.

337
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,840
言重了  霍夫斯塔德博士
You're welcome, dr. hofstadter.

338
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,330
好吧  我去拿你的出院单
Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.

339
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,550
怎么了
What?

340
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,290
你就像只可爱至极的小鸟
Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person.

341
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,680
我真不明白为什么你那么不招女人待见呢
I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.

342
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,190
能替我打开吗
Hey, can you open this for me?

343
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,160
我能看你的缝针吗
Can I see your stitches?

344
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,980
可以
Sure.

345
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,750
终于明白为什么
Answering the question once and for all

346
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,890
沃罗威茨会退出医学院了
Why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.

347
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,860
莱纳德  可喜可贺啊
Leonard, congratulations.

348
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,710
为啥
What for?

349
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,690
你在facebook里的资料更新了
Your facebook status update.

350
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,940
莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德恋爱了
Leonard hofstadter is "in a relationship."

351
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,480
什么  不对  这不对
What? no. no, that's not right.

352
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,260
伙计  在她更新前  你就更新你的了
Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?

353
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,570
以我专业人士的眼光来看  真是饥不择食啊
Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.

354
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,460
动真格的吗
Seriously?

355
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,090
才两周  你就先表白了
You went first, after only two weeks?

356
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,600
真是有胆
That's bold...

357
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,470
这不是有胆  这是个误会
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

358
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,590
我没更新我的资料
I didn't change my status.

359
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,080
那是谁干的
Well, then who did?

360
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,620
我别无选择  他都在人家面前哭了
I had no choice. he cried in front of her.

361
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,610
你侵入了我在facebook里的账户
You hacked my facebook account?

362
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,640
这算不上侵入
Oh, it's hardly hacking

363
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,680
做什么你都用这个密码
when you use the same password for everything,

364
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,640
卡尔-艾尔[就是超人]
"kal-el."

365
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,130
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

366
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,070
她现在会以为我是没人要的
Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

367
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,410
你毁了我们的关系
You've destroyed this relationship!

368
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,350
你知道最糟糕的是什么吗
And you want to know what the worst part is?

369
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,100
你根本不知道自己哪里做错了  因为你
You don't even understand what you did wrong because you

370
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,310
自以为在任何方面你都是专家
Can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!

371
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,030
在那方面  我不是
In which I am not an expert.

372
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,320
不要说话
Don't even!

373
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,170
我一个字都不想听
I don't want to hear another word out of you.

374
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,160
怎么了  莱西  蒂米掉到井里了吗[《灵犬莱西》里情节]
What's wrong, lassie? timmy fall down the well?

375
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,650
她也更新了自己在facebook里的资料
She just updated her facebook status.

376
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,820
斯蒂芬尼·巴内特和莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
"stephanie barnett is in a relationship

377
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,120
相恋了
with leonard hofstadter."

378
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,560
真的吗
Really?

379
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,480
瞧瞧这个
Oh, look at that.

380
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,150
我有女友了
I have a girlfriend.

381
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,450
容许我再说一句
If I am permitted to speak again,

382
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,010
谢尔顿·库珀博士:为胜利而生
dr. sheldon cooper for the win.
