1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,510
考虑加入实验物理学行业的同学们
So you are considering going into experimental physics,

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,270
我的大门永远向你们敞开
My door is always open.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,310
另外我要再次道歉 可能我的实验不怎么成功
Once again, I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't quite work out,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,070
但我们现在知道 你不小心把斯奈普桃汁
But now we know what happens when you accidentally spill

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,760
掉进氦氖激光器的时候会发生什么了
Peach snapple into a helium neon laser.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,210
简单来说就是  别这么干
Short answer is... don't.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,470
现在我们来介绍一下理论物理系
And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,140
有请谢尔顿·库珀博士
Is dr. sheldon cooper.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,410
库珀博士
Dr. cooper?

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,570
别叫我
Forget it.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,540
稍等
Excuse me.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,710
谢尔顿  我们都商量好了
Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,940
别浪费时间
It's a waste of time.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,010
我还不如给一群拉布拉多狗
I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,370
讲讲热力学定律呢
To a bunch of labradoodles.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,740
你再不出来 我就不带你去动漫书店
If you don't do this, i won't take you to the comic book store.

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,840
你们好
Hello.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,710
顺便说一句  你的激光器不错
Nice work with the laser, by the way.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,770
看见你们朝气蓬勃的脸庞
Looking out at your fresh young faces,

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,070
我回想起了我决定步入学术道路的那一刻
I remember when I too was deciding my academic future

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,210
那时我还是个卑微的研究生
As a lowly graduate student.

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,670
忘了说  我14岁
Of course, I was 14.

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,670
不过我已经取得了你们大多数人
And I'd already achieved more than most of you

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,040
望尘莫及的成就  虽然我九点上床
Could ever hope to, despite my 9:00 bedtime.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,270
现在  这个屋子里可能有一两个人
Now, there may be one or two of you in this room

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,440
具备学好理论物理学的基本素质
Who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics.

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
即使可能你们学成了之后
Although, it's more likely that you'll spend

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,310
只是拿来教五年级的小学生
Your scientific careers teaching fifth graders

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,120
要做一个纸壳模型火山

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,940
要怎么使用碳酸氢钠火山岩

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,450
感谢老天
Oh, good god.

32
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,540
简单来说
In short--

33
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,370
如果谁告诉你们你们有朝一日
Any one who told you that you would someday be able

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,540
能在物理学上有所建树
To make any significant contribution to physics,

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,740
那完全是个残忍的笑话  太残忍了
Played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,670
有问题吗
Any questions?

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,710
当然没有
Of course not.

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,770
我为科学的未来流泪
I weep for the future of science.

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,560
现在请允许我失陪了 新一期蝙蝠侠出版了
Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of batman is out.

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,310
走吧  莱纳德
Come, leonard.

41
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,170
现在看来  那个激光器实验还不错吧
Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,630
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第06集

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,390
我喜欢每年的这个时候
I love this time of the year.

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,420
落叶漫天飞舞 秋高气爽
The leaves are turning, there's a bracing chill in the air.

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,290
还有  校园里一整群女生
Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,320
开始长刚刚好的秋膘
About to put on just enough winter weight

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,490
让她们看起来既寒酸又易推倒
To make them needy and vulnerable.

48
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,750
就是这样  宝贝  再来一份奶酪饼
That's right, honey, have another calzone.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,450
爸爸等着你
Daddy can wait.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,590
大学里没有规定 不能和研究生约会吗
Isn't there a university policy against dating graduate students?

51
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,590
没有  只要你搭得上讪  你就可以约一个
No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,990
妈的  陷阱真是无处不在
Damn, there's always a catch.

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,090
你们好
Hey, guys.

54
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,090
你好  莱斯利
Hey, leslie.

55
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,620
傻蛋  我听说你昨晚把一个研究生恶心吐了
So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.

56
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,230
事实才是伸到那些喜欢道听途说者的嗓子眼里
The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,610
让你呕吐的那根手指头
Of those unprepared to hear it.

58
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,050
不过我干嘛要跟二流智商的人解释这些呢
But why should I cater to second-rate minds?

59
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,020
因为一流智商的人叫你傻蛋
Because first-rate minds call you "dumbass"?

60
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,320
是吗  噢
Oh, yeah? well...

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,850
你这个人真刻薄
You're a mean person.

62
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,250
打扰了  库珀博士
Excuse me, dr. cooper,

63

64
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,090
我昨晚上旁听了你的讲话
I was at your talk last night.

65
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,150
我觉得你实在是个天才
I think you're just brilliant.

66
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,550
大家都这么认为
That is the prevailing opinion.

67
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,850
我现在确实要吐了
Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.

68
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,420

75
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,820
三维线形网能够形成一张图

中微子如何从线形网聚合物中显形 这一难题了
In showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.

81
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,620
天啊  那我们看物理学宇宙的方式 就彻底改变了
Oh, my god, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.

82
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,390
我就是在做这个
It's what I do.

83
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,620
其实  我们的平斯金-沃罗威茨 废液处理系统
You know, the pishkin-wolowitz liquid waste disposal system

84
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,820
也震动了一些人
Is turning a few heads as well.

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,820
再说一次  没兴趣
Again, ew.

86
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,620
我还想听听 你打算如何增加中微子

Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?

88
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,450
我不喝咖啡

I do. I love me a cup of joe.

90
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,250
那  不一定要喝咖啡
Well, it doesn't have to be coffee.

91
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,390
晚餐好嘛
How about dinner?

92
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,020
我是得吃晚餐

94
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,250
我不在奇怪的餐馆吃饭

95
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,890
受不合格的餐具危害生命

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,450
三尖的是三叉戟

100
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,690
叉子  可以用来吃饭
Forks are for eating,

101
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,290
三叉戟 只能治理七大洋[海神波塞冬的象征物和武器]
Tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

102
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,250
那我打包带到你家吃怎么样
What if I brought food to your place?

103
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,020
这还差不多
That would be acceptable.

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,950
星期一  我吃泰国菜

111
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,550
当然  很明显我有免费的晚餐吃了
Yes. apparently I'm getting a free dinner.

112
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,920
别试了  这东西大概是坏了
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's majorly out of order.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
-看  -不好意思
- See? - sorry.

114
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
没什么
That's okay.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,190
看来得走楼梯了
Guess I'm taking the stairs.

116
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,290

123
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,390
高高瘦瘦的
Tall, thin,

124
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,720
看着像只正在祈祷的大螳螂的那个?
Looks a little like a giant praying mantis?

125

I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.

138
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,450
你喜不喜欢我那个注脚
Did you enjoy the humorous footnote

139
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,890
把镜像对称性形容为
Where I illustrate  mirror-symmetry

140
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,290
光和自己玩网球的比喻
By likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself?

141
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,990
太有意思了
So funny.

142
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,020
我不得不说  一想到你可能把重力引入进去
But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity,

143
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,820
就让我浑身兴奋
I have to tell you, I found it  physically exhilarating.

144
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,050
我的假设就是想有这种效果
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

145
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,320
抱歉  我没带够你朋友的份
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough For your friends.

146
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,990
我以为就我们俩呢
I assumed we were going to be alone.

147
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,150
我们正要走呢
No, we were just going.

148
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,750
去看  对吧
To watch, right?

149
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,450
不  走吧  我们出去了
No, come on, now, we're going out.

150
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,990
别  我们不出声
Oh, come on, we'll be quiet.

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,690
走吧走吧
Let's go, let's go.

152
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,350
你们俩
Okay, you two.

153
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,050
玩的高兴点
Have a nice...

154
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,590
不管这算什么
Whatever this is.

155
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,290
伙计们  听着 我知道这和我没关系
Okay, you guys, look, i know this is none of my business,

156
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,950
不过我忍不住要问
But I just... I have to ask--

157
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,190
谢尔顿的取向是什么
What's sheldon's deal?

158
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,790
你说的取向指的是什么
What do you mean "deal"?

159
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,790
你知道的  就是他的取向嘛
You know, like what's his deal?

160
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,450
喜欢女生  男生  仿真娃娃
Is it girls...? guys...? sock puppets...?

161
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,920
老实说  我们的假设是
Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption

162
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,220
他没有取向
That he has no deal.

163
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,220
得了吧  每个人都有的
Come on, everybody has a deal.

164
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,520
不包括谢尔顿
Not sheldon.

165
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
这些年来  我们列出了很多假设
Over the years, we've formulated many theories

166
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,950
关于他如何繁殖
About how he might reproduce.

167
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,320
我支持有丝分裂
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

168
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,150
什么意思
I'm sorry?

169
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,990
我相信总有一天谢尔顿吃了足够多的泰国菜
I believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount

170
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,220
然后分裂成两个
Of thai food and split into two sheldons.

171
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,190
另一方面  我认为
On the other hand, I think sheldon

172
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,020
谢尔顿处于他这种生物的幼虫阶段
Might be the larval form of his species,

173
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,290
有一天他会结一个茧
And someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later

174
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,650
两个月后带着翅膀和外骨骼破茧而出
With moth wings and an exoskeleton.

175
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,820
谢谢让我做噩梦
Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.

176
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,390
想和我们一起出去么
Hey, do you want to hang out with us?

177
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,250
你们几个去干嘛
What are you guys gonna do?

178
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,850
我妈妈晚上做了鸡胸肉
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

179
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,650
带小洋葱的那种
The one with the little onions? mm...

180
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,920
我还有点事
Yeah, I'm busy, so...

181
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,790
晚安
Good night.

182
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,820
这是她的损失  我们走
Her loss. let's go.

183
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,750
鸡胸肉聚会
Brisket party!

184
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,090
鸡呀嘛鸡  胸呀嘛胸
B-to-the-r-to-the-i-s-k...

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,490
肉呀嘛肉
To-the-e-to-the-t...

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,160
你不吃早饭
Hey, aren't you having breakfast?

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,660
吃呀
Yes.

188
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,820
你是不是又在做营养坐药的试验了
Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?

189
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,390
做那实验可不能穿这裤子
Not in these pants.

190
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,360
昨晚和拉蒙娜过的怎么样
So... how'd it go with ramona last night?

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,060
好极了 她很聪明  有思想
Oh, great. She's smart, insightful

192
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,220
而且她用她特有的方式  那个  崇拜我
And she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.

193
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
你的菠菜蘑菇鸡蛋卷
Here's your spinach mushroom omelet .

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,030
有没有人碰过
Did anyone touch it?

196
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,300
他们都带手套啦 我特别小心
Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.

197
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,830
拉蒙娜指出我每天都在餐厅排队上
Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,900
浪费了20分钟
Standing on cafeteria lines.

199
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,330
这些时间如果能用在攻克
Time which would be better spent

200
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,200
当今的物理学难题该多好啊
Tackling the great physics problems of our day.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,060
拉蒙娜你不用主动攻击那些大的课题
You don't tackle the big issues, ramona.

202
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
你要回避之
You fence with them.

203
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,460
以守为攻是也
En garde. riposte.

204
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
所言极是
Touche.

205
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,090
早上好
Morning.

206
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,260
嗨  莱斯利
Hi, leslie.

207
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,360
谢尔顿
So, sheldon,

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,290
听说你在给史密森尼 傻蛋博物馆整理论文呢
I see you're organizing your papers for the smithsonian museum of dumbassery.

209
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,160
目前没有空缺
There won't be any room

210
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,590
除非他们能把永久馆藏的莱斯利·温克尔请出去
Until they get rid of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit.

211
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,490
精妙
Oh, good one.

212
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,990
你找了个研究生护着你哈
I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you.

213
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,520
今天就不收你保护费了
I'll let you keep your lunch money today.

214
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,420
库珀博士就要取得重大突破了
Okay, dr. cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough.

215
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,490
如果你想待在这
If you're going to stay,

216
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,390
就必须心怀敬意  别出声
You'll have to be respectful and quiet.

217
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,360
等等我
Wait for me.

218
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,690
你解决了中微子那个问题了么
So have you worked out the neutrino issue?

219
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,890
这就好像改写莫扎特的曲子
Well, to paraphrase mozart,

220
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,390
所有的次原子粒子都已经在那了
All the subatomic particles are there.

221
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,560
我要做的就是给它们排个序
I just have to put them in the right order.

222
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,860
你真幽默
You're so witty.

223
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,920
不是么
Aren't i?

224
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,960
嗨  大家好  有快递给
Hey, guys, this package came for...

225
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,560
库珀博士正在工作
Dr. cooper is working.

226
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,890
我马上就会有新的突破啦
Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

227
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,220
好痒
Ooh, it tickles!

228
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,190
不好意思
Sorry.

229
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,760
我的老天
Holy crap on a cracker.

230
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,890
嗨  佩妮
Hey, penny.

231
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,090
嗨  你不会想进去的
Hi. you probably don't want to go in there.

232
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,590
咋了  他们干嘛呢
Why? what are they doing?

233
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,290
那种场景
The only way I could explain it

234
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,920
只可能出现在放着洋娃娃的临床医生的诊室里
Would be in a therapist's office with dolls.

235
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,990
好家伙
Hoo-boy.

236
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,790
库珀博士在工作
Dr. cooper's working.

237
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,990
看得出来
Yeah, I can see that.

238
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,120
谢尔顿  光晕之夜  在库萨帕里家  你来么
Sheldon, halo night, koothrappali's. you coming?

239
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,590
当然  光晕之夜嘛
Oh, yes, it's halo night.

240
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,320
等我擦脚
Let me just dry my tootsies.

241
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,620
你不是要去光晕之夜吧
You're not going to halo night.

242
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,820
是要去
Yes, I am.

243
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
今天周三  周三是光晕之夜
It's wednesday. wednesday's halo night.

244
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,420
不是有个伟大的人曾经说过  为科学别无所求
Didn't a great man once say, "science demands nothing less

245
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,060
为科学执着追求  为科学无条件 奉献一生么
"than the fervent and unconditional dedication of our entire lives"?

246
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,660
是有人说过
He did.

247
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,420
那么那个伟大的人是谁呢
And who was that great man?

248
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,190
是我
Me.

249
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,790
抱歉莱纳德
Sorry, leonard.

250
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,320
搞笑  你真不来啦
Seriously? you're not coming?

251
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,960
你也听到了  我无法反驳自己
You heard her. how can I argue with me?

252
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,590
好吧  再次祝你们开心
Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good...

253
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,820
不管干嘛
Whatever this is.

254
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,860
库珀博士  我不得不说
Dr. cooper, I have to tell you

255
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,520
你的朋友拉你后腿了
Your friends are holding you back.

256
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,960
应该这么想  我在带领他们前进
I prefer to think of it as "i'm pulling them forward."

257
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,820
光晕之夜
Halo night?

258
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,060
像你这样极具天赋的人
A man with your intellectual gifts

259
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,720
是不会把整晚都浪费在打游戏上边的
Doesn't waste an evening playing video games.

260
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,220
他周三确实会
He does on wednesdays.

261
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,590
如果他想得诺贝尔奖就不会
Not if he wants a nobel prize.

262
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,420
他是想得
He does want that.

263
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,320
那像他一样极具天赋的人
Does a man with my intellectual gifts

264
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
周末玩彩蛋射击么
Play paintball on weekends?

265
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,220
你说呢
What do you think?

266
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,260
惨了
Drat.

267
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,190
现在可以继续工作了吧
Now shall we get back to work?

268
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,860
应该可以
I suppose.

269
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,720
今晚有播《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》
Battlestar galactica  comes on tonight.

270
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,760
我也可以等DVD版
I guess I can wait for the dvd.

271
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,260
还是别再看了
And then never ever watch it.

272
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,690
佩妮  佩妮
Penny! penny!

273
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,090
佩妮
Penny!

274
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,560
谢尔顿  亲爱的  我说过
Sheldon, honey, I've told you,

275
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,720
房子很小
It's a small apartment.

276
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,190
只要敲一次门就行
You only have to knock one time.

277
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,360
求你了  我时间不多
Please, please, I don't have a lot of time.

278
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,420
听着  拉蒙娜终于睡着了
Look, ramona finally dozed off,

279
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,120
我要你帮我甩了她
And I need you to help me get rid of her.

280
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,960
怎么甩了她
Get rid of her how?

281
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,260
我不知道
I don't know,

282
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,390
但显然我陷进某种关系里了
But apparently I'm in some kind of relationship,

283
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,460
而你似乎很擅长结束这种关系
And you seem to be an expert at ending them.

284
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,320
什么
Excuse me?

285
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,920
我见证了一个又一个男人从你屋子离开后就一去不回
I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.

286
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,190
首先  不是一个又一个男人
Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.

287
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,260
-库珀博士  -把我藏起来
Dr. cooper?! hide me.

288
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,390
把你藏起来
Hide you?

289
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,520
我正式请求进入避难所
I formally request sanctuary.

290
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,260
你怎么没在工作
Why aren't you working?

291
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,960
她分散我的注意力
She distracted me.

292
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,790
我跟你说了  佩妮  我没闲工夫跟你瞎胡闹
I told you, penny, I don't have time for your nonsense.

293
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,890
我有很重要的事要做
I have important things to do.

294
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,220
老天
Oh, man.

295
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,520
我知道怎么回事
I know what's going on here.

296
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,560
真的吗
Really?

297
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,620
那你能给我解释一下吗
Well, then will you explain it to me?

298
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,890
你爱上库珀博士了
You're in love with dr. cooper.

299
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,660
不  不是的
Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

300
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
别狡辩了
Don't try to deny it.

301
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,220
他是个出色的男人
He's a remarkable man,

302
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,990
但你必须放过他
But you have to let him go.

303
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,860
老天爷  没问题
Oh, gee, okay.

304
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,960
我知道很难放手  但他是全世界的礼物
I know it's hard, but he's a gift to the whole world,

305
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,490
我们不能这么自私
And we can't be selfish.

306
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,660
对  他绝对是瑰宝
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

307
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,520
拉钩保证
Sisters?

308
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,860
当然可以
Uh, sure.

309
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,620
拉钩保证
Sisters.

310
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,920
极品级怪胎
Holy crap on a cracker.

311
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,290
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

312
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,490
你在干嘛
What are you doing?!

313
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,160
这是莫尔斯电码
It's morse code.

314
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,660
干嘛
Why?

315
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,260
这样我们才能隔墙通话
So we can communicate through the wall.

316
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,220
我们不正在隔墙通话嘛
We are communicating through the wall.

317
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,360
对  但通话没有加密
Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.

318
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,220
我不懂莫尔斯电码
I don't know morse code.

319
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,160
很简单
It's very simple.

320
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,490
这是A 这是B  这是C
This is a ... This is b ... this is c...

321
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,020
谢尔顿  我不会在凌晨3点 学莫尔斯电码的
Sheldon, I'm not going to learn morse code at 3:00 in the morning!

322
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,520
好吧
All right.

323
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,520
别进来  别进来  别进来
Don't come in here, don't come in here, don't come in here,

324
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,560
别
Don't... oh!

325
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,090
怎么回事
What's going on?

326
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,620
嘘  拉蒙娜正在沙发上睡觉
Shh! ramona's sleeping on the couch.

327
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,520
我知道  她什么时候回家
I know. when is she going home?

328
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,060
她不回家了  问题就在这
Never. that's the problem.

329
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,290
我要你帮忙
I need your help.

330
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,960
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

331
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,120
我要调用友情条约里的天网条款
I'm invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement.

332
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,090
那个只能在你要我帮你
That only applies if you need me

333
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,890
摧毁你创造的夺取地球的
To help you destroy an artificial intelligence

334
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,660
人工智能机器人时才能用
You've created that's taking over the earth.

335
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,020
行了  别挑剔了
Come on! don't nitpick!

336
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,990
晚安
Good night.

337
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,490
嘘  好吧
Shh. all right.

338
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,060
我调用夺身条款
I'm invoking our body snatchers clause.

339
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,090
夺身条款只能在你要我
The body snatchers clause requires me

340
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,890
帮你摧毁我们知道被外星人
To help you destroy someone we know

341
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,090
附身的人
Who's been replaced with an alien pod.

342
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,720
对  她就在客厅  快上
Yes. she's in the living room. go.

343
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,790
我在这等你
I'll wait here.

344
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,460
谢尔顿  你怎么没睡觉
Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?

345
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,860
现在  动手
Now! do it!

346
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,320
你得知道  你要好好睡觉
You know you need your sleep

347
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
这样你的认知过程
In order for your cognitive processing

348
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,790
才能表现在最佳水平  快走吧
To perform at optimum levels. now come on.

349
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,760
哥斯拉条款
Godzilla clause?

350
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,860
除非她要摧毁东京
Not unless she destroys tokyo.

351
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,160
小人
Rats.

352
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,090
我搞定了
I've got it!

353
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,690
我终于用我的 链性网状结构固化物
I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox

354
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,990
解决了黑洞资讯矛盾
With my theory of string-network condensates!

355
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,720
太不可思议了
It's unbelievable!

356
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,420
这是历史性的改变
It's paradigm-altering.

357
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,260
没有你我根本做不到
And I could not have done it without you.

358
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,520
才怪  我只是给你一点鼓励而已
Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.

359
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,020
远不止这些
It was a lot more than that.

360
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,420
你帮我理清杂乱的费米子
You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions

361
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,490
你还帮我磨锤状趾
And you pumiced my hammer toe.

362
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,590
我该怎么报答你
How can I ever repay you?

363
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,260
你能把它命名为库珀诺维茨基定理吗
Well, would you consider naming it the cooper-nowitzki theorem?

364
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,590
谁是诺维茨基
Who's nowitzki?

365
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,790
我就是诺维茨基啊
I'm nowitzki.

366
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,090
你要我分享这份荣誉
Oh, you want me to share credit?

367
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,060
对
Uh-huh.

368
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,520
滚出去
Get out!

369
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,490
你好
Oh, hey, hi.

370
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,160
我要去死
Oh, bite me!

371
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,860
拉钩保证
Sisters?

372
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,860
打扰一下  库珀博士
Excuse me, dr. cooper.

373
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,490
我是凯西·奥布莱恩
I'm kathy o'brien.

374
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,820
我刚刚读完了你的
I just finished reading your paper

375
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,090
利用链性网状结构固化物
Reconciling the black hole information paradox

376
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,420
解决黑洞资讯矛盾的论文
With your theory of string- network condensates,

377
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,260
让我惊叹得喘不过气来
And it just took my breath away.

378
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,390
等我发表了  我可以送你个人工呼吸器
Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.

379
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,090
我能跟你交流一下吗
Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?

380
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,560
我想想  今天是周四
Let's see. today's thursday.

381
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,520
周四晚  我吃雅阁墨的比萨饼
Thursday nights, I eat pizza from giacomo's.

382
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,020
加香肠  蘑菇  少量橄榄油
Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.

383
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,060
好极了  我会带到你家去
Great. I'll bring it to your place.

384
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,820
我有你的地址
I have the address.

385
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,790
多好的姑娘
What a nice girl.

386
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,060
谢尔顿  你没看到刚刚发生的事吗
Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?

387
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,660
看到了  我有免费比萨吃了
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

388
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,620
看我人气多高
I'm on a roll.

389
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,090
再来一份泰国菜吧
More pad thai, please.

390
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,420
谢尔顿  你已经吃了四份了
Sheldon, you've already had four servings.

391
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,890
你还是吃慢点吧  老兄
You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.

392
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,090
就再吃一口
Just one more bite.

393
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,590
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

394
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,920
谢尔顿  你没事吧
Sheldon, are you okay?

395
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,020
我只是吃撑了
I'm just so... full.

396
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,690
够了  不能再吃泰国菜了
That's it. no more thai food.
