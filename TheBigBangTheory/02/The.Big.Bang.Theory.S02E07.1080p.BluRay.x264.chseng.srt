时间到

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,030
好的  克林贡迷们  放下铅笔
All right, Klingons, pencils down.

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,090
好的  我这有 "pokh"[星际迷航里的克林贡语]
Okay, I have "pokh."

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
有了  有了

"Potl"
"Potl."

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,030
有了  有了

和"kreplach"
And "kreplach."

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,290
等等  "Kreplach"吗
Hold on a second. "Kreplach?"

14
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,120
对
Yeah.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,510
那不是克林贡语  那是依地语  意思是肉馅饺子
That isn't Klingon; it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,560
看来它也是克林贡语中的词语
Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,990
真的吗  给它下个定义
Really? Define it.

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,730
"Kreplach":  美味的克林贡饺子
"Kreplach": A hearty Klingon... dumpling.

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,090
裁判怎么裁决
Judge's ruling?

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,960
不予采纳
Bilurrrbe.

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,760
大伙  我要看一下你们的电视
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.

22
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,930
你的怎么了
What's wrong with your TV?

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,090
我也不知道  刚刚没影了
I don't know. It just died.

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,430
里面全是雪花
I'm getting a bunch of static.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,590
你付你的有线电视费了吗
Did you pay your cable bill?

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,090
你这口气跟有线电视公司一样
Ugh, you sound just like the cable company.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,090
好吧  大家安静
All right, so, shh!

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,860

Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America's Next Top Model.

29
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,590
抱歉  佩妮  但我们要
Excuse me, Penny, but we're...

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,590
别  别  别告诉她
No, no, don't tell her.

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,660
正在玩克林贡语拼字游戏
playing Klingon Boggle.

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,390
哦
Aw...

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,760
你"哦"什么
What do you mean, "Aw"?

34
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,890
难道她不知道我们是书呆子吗
Like she didn't know we were nerds?

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
好吧  如果你一定要看的话
All right, if you must watch,

36
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,690
那就请你静音  只看字幕
then mute it with closed captions, please.

37
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,030
随你
Fine.

38
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,090
好了  拼字斗士们  开始吧
All right, Boggle warriors... kapla'!

39
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,430
看看这些姑娘
Look at those women.

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,760
真是光彩照人啊
They're gorgeous.

41
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,830
"Worf"  不错  名词  当专有名词就太可惜了
Oh! "Worf," nice! Too bad that's a proper noun.

42
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,430
看那位  她就是未来的沃罗威茨夫人
Oh, look, the's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

43
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,430
不对  等等  那位才是
No, wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

44
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,830
头上戴着
With her head in the lap of...

45
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,690
真是太巧了  她才是未来的沃罗威茨夫人
Oh, what a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,560
对  她们都可以搬去同你和你妈妈一起住
Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother.

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,190
现任的沃罗威茨夫人
The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

48
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,330
"qochbe'"是用嘴发音  还是用喉咙发音
Is "qochbe'" spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?

49
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,990
为什么沃罗威茨夫人在哭呢
Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,160
那是阿娜伊斯
That's Anais.

51
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,430
房子里其她女孩都不喜欢她
None of the other girls in the house like her.

52
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,390
房子  什么房子
House? What house?

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,090
她们都居住在同一所房子里
They all live in a house together.

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
房子在哪
A house, where?

55
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,890
我不知道  洛杉矶的某个地方吧
I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,060
等一下
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,930
你是说我只需开车就能到
You're telling me that I'm within driving distance

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,890
这些胸怀大志的超模们的住所吗
of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,590
对  我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,360
她们住在一起  一同沐浴  还
And they live together and shower together and...

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,930
裸体枕头大战
have naked pillow fights?

62
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,630
你要去哪
Hey, wh-where are you going?

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,590
去付我的有线电视费
To pay my cable bill.

64
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,890
好的  放下铅笔
All right, pencils down!

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,100
我这有"lokh" "makh"和"cherrrkh"
I have "lokh," "makh," and "cherrrkh."

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,640
你们有吗
Anybody got those?

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,290
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第07集

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,060
我错过什么了吗  她们把吉塞尔踢出去了吗
Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,000
还没  不过她在水下拍的照片  真是丢死人了
Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,460
很不幸  吉塞尔·沃罗威茨夫人对氯过敏
Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine.

71
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,400
对她来说是好事  我喜欢出水芙蓉的大眼模特
Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,000
谢尔顿  食物买来了
Sheldon, the food's here.

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,200
到屋子了
Ooh, there's the house.

74
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,600
定格  快定格
Freeze frame, freeze frame.

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,260
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

76
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,500
标记星辰位置和地理特征
Marking the star positions and physical landmarks

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,100
那样我们就能找到超模的屋子啦
so we can find the house of the supermodels.

78
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,260
为什么
Why?

79
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,930
这不是明摆着吗
Isn't it obvious?

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,060
她们每周都会踢出一个漂亮的女孩
Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl,

81
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,200
让她自尊受损  感觉在这里不受欢迎
making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem.

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,930
也可以叫未来的霍华德·沃罗威茨夫人
A.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,930

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,530
-还有额外的面包吗  -我问了
-Extra breading? -I asked.

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,460
-他们怎么说  -没有  -你抗议了吗
-What did they say? -No. -Did you protest?

89
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,030
-是的  -吵架了吗  -没
-Yes. -Vociferously? -No.

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,330
那你怎么现在才来
Well, then what took you so long?

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,660
你就吃吧
Just eat.

92
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
大伙  我错过什么了吗
Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,700
吉塞尔现在命悬一线
Giselle's hanging by a thread.

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,960
太好了  我讨厌她
Oh, good, I hate her.

95
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,700
那我们大喜之日就不邀请你了
Then you're not invited to our wedding.

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,700
给你
Here you go.

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,860
谢谢
Thank you.

98
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,430
咱们还要看
Oh, do we have to suffer through this

99
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,130
这个暗箱操作严重的伪真人秀节目吗
transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
对
Yes.

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,630
咱俩有固定的电视节目表
You and I have a standing TV schedule,

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,230
那是我们多次争论和妥协的结果
which is the result of extensive debate and compromise.

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,630
除非是插播新闻  否则任何变更
Any alterations except for breaking news

104
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,060
都要在一周室友大会上提前获得批准
have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.

105
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,500
写在议程里吧
Put it on the agenda.

106
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,260
但你必须先提案  才能写到议程里
But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.

107
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,100
我可以提案呀  但你不会喜欢的
Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.

108
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,060
好吧  你就嘲笑议会程序吧
Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure.

109
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,160
至少能把声音关掉吧
At least put it on mute.

110
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,400
吉赛尔根本不会被踢掉
Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off.

111
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,960
穿得是越来越清凉了啊
It's totally going to be Summer.

112
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,660
咋啦
What?

113
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,630
谢尔顿的洋葱圈  快放回去
Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back!

114
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,330
不过是个洋葱圈嘛
It's one onion ring.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
在他发现前赶快放回去
Just put it back before he comes!

116
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,130
错错错
No, no, no!

117
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,900
我觉得原来不是放在那的
No, I don't think that's where it was.

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
他来了  大家不要承认啊
Okay, here he comes.  Deny, deny, people.

119
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,060
都别吭气
Wall of silence.

120
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,430
谁动了我的
Who touched my...

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,800
佩妮  佩妮干的
Penny! Penny did it.

122
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,260
你为什么要这么对我
Why would you do that?

123
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,330
不知道  我饿了
I don't know. I was hungry?

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,700
有什么大不了的
What's the big deal?

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,260
没有人可以动我盘子里的食物
The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.

126
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,130
好吧  我不知道  对不起了
All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

127
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,630
我也对不起了  但你二振了
Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.

128
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,300
什么
What?

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,730
你有两振了
You have two strikes.

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,530
三振出局
Three strikes and you're out.

131
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,260
这是个体育方面的暗喻
It's a sports metaphor.

132
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,130
体育方面的暗喻
A sports metaphor?

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,030
是的  棒球
Yes, baseball.

134
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,960
好吧  我加入
All right, yeah. I-I'll play along.

135
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,100
我什么时候一振的
What was my first strike?

136
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
三月十八号
March 18th.

137
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,060
你违反了我设立的禁止转发搞笑邮件的规定
You violated my rule about forwarding email humor.

138
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,560
我有吗
I did?

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,800
那只想吃"芝士汉包"的猫的图片
The photo of the cat who wants to "has cheezeburger"?

140
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,760
拜托  每个人都喜欢搞笑猫
Oh, come on. Everybody loves "LOL cats."

141
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,260
多可爱啊  它们是猫嘛所以不会拼写
They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.

142
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,330
我信任你才给你我的邮箱
I trusted you with my email address,

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,060
你发网络老古董给我  这就背叛了我对你的信任
and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality:

144
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,400
一振
strike one.

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,130
动了我的食物  二振
Touching my food: strike two.

146
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,260
别担心  只在你的档案里保存一年
Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.

147
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,000
你也能早点把它们从你的档案里去掉  可就得去上他的课
You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.

148
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,960
拜托  我就碰了一个洋葱圈
Come on, I touched one onion ring.

149
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,360
没错  但你又把它放回来了
Yeah, and then you put it back,

150
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,330
从而污染了其它洋葱圈
compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.

151
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,600
亲爱的  你以后还想不想搭我的车了
Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?

152
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,530
听着佩妮  我也想对你宽容一些
Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you,

153
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
但你现在已经是我们这个小团体的永久成员了
but since you've become a permanent member of our social group,

154
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,900
我就得告诉你一些大家都遵循的规矩
I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.

155
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,730
恭喜了  你正式成为我们中的一员
Congratulations. You're officially one of us.

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,360
新成员  新成员
One of us, one of us.

157
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,030
太激动了
Well, what a thrill.

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
你坐在我的位子上了
You're sitting in my spot.

159
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,330
天呐  别跟我开玩笑了
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

160
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,460
莱纳德  她坐在我的位置上呢
Leonard, she's in my spot.

161
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,630
事情是这样的
Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing.

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,630
你走了以后  我还要和他住在一起
After you leave, I still have to live with him.

163
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,730
我不管  我就坐这了
I don't care. I'm taking a stand.

164
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,530
这是个暗喻[taking a stand  明确立场]
Metaphorically.

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,700
那好吧  三振出局
All right, that's it. Strike three.

166
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
噢  三振
Ooh, strike three.

167
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,660
我被驱逐了
I'm banished?

168
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,160
什么东西啊
What the hell kind of crap is that?

169
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,900
别担心  我会和他谈谈的
Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.

170
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,260
没错  你谈吧
Yeah, you do that.

171
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,260
弱弱地问一句  你愿意来听他的课么
Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class?

172
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,860
你可以在网上听
You can do it online!

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
根据我们的三角测量法
So based on our triangulation,

174
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,910
我们锁定了超模的所在地
we've narrowed down the location of the Top Model house

175
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,610
在好莱坞山周围三平方英里内
to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,780
或者在北卡罗来纳的杜伦
Or possibly Durham, Noh Carolina.

177
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,740
我们找到的时候你想和我们一起去么
When we find it, you want to go with us?

178
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,710
去做什么
To do what?

179
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,540
和漂亮姑娘开派对啊
Party with the pretty girls, dude!

180
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,980
你疯了么
Are you insane?

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
你可去不成
You're not going to party with them.

182
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,440
你连接近那个地方都做不到
You're not even going to get anywhere near that place.

183
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,640
关于月球  当年他们也是对阿姆斯特朗[登月第一人]也是这么说的
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.

184
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,640
没人对阿姆斯特朗说过这样的话
No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong.

185
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,640
为了送一个人上月球
The entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure

186
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,110
整个国家做出了十年的努力
to put a man on the moon.

187
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,610
我亲爱的美国兄弟们  不出今年
Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out,

188
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,640
我们就可以把沃罗威茨送到一个超级模特身边去
we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.

189
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,140
之后会有很多人认为这事从来没发生过
And a large number of people will believe it never happened.

190
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,980
让我想想
Okay, let me guess.

191
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,980
莱纳德要为乳糖不耐受人准备的配豆腐乳的油炸玉米粉饼
A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,380
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,980
不要杏仁的大虾凯撒沙拉
Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,740
是给极易过敏只在重大节日进行犹太洁食的霍华德的
for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,110
给我们突然回到印度饮食习惯的拉杰的是
And for our suddenly "back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,

196
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,780
专给爱吃肉的人准备的披萨不放肉
the meatlover's pizza, no meat.

197
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,310
马上就来
Coming right up.

198
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,510
等下
Wait. Excuse me.

199
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,940
你忘了我的烧烤培根芝士汉堡
You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

200
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,410
烤肉酱  培根  芝士单放
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,610
我没告诉你么
Oh, I didn't tell you?

202
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,310
你被芝士蛋糕工厂驱逐了
You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.

203
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,710
为什么
Why?

204
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,940
因为你三振了呀
Well, you have three strikes.

205
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,780
进门一振  坐下二振
One: coming in. Two: sitting down.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,380
三振是因为我不喜欢你的态度
And three: I don't like your attitude.

207
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,940
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

208
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,240
这不仅违反了加州法律
Not only is it a violation of California state law,

209
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,280
而且明目张胆地违背了芝士蛋糕工厂的规定
it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.

210
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,910
不会  现在有新的规定了
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:

211
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,210
日本人与谢尔顿不准进入
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

212
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,710
我打赌这种牌子一定能在帕萨迪纳大卖
I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.

213
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,710
佩妮  我能和你说句话么
Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?

214
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,280
事情是这样的
Well, here's the thing.

215
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,140
我和谢尔顿谈过了 他也觉得自己过分
Um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible

216
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,980
他也认为他有点不可理喻  有点过火了
and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.

217
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,580
真的吗  那太好了
Really? Well, that's great.

218
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
是的  跟他道个歉  好吗
Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?

219
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,480
什么  我干嘛要向那个疯子道歉
What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.

220
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,780
别这样  其实很简单
Oh, come on. It's easy.

221
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,010
他还会亲自指导你怎么道歉
He'll even tell you what to say.

222
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,180
莱纳德  你还没开窍吗
Leard, don't you get it?

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
如果你们一味让他这样神经兮兮
If you guys keep going along with his insanity,

224
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,390
会助长他的气焰
you're just encouraging him.

225
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,650
才没有 我们是  卑躬屈膝
We're not encouraging. It's more like... knuckling under.

226
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,820
我喜欢和你们一起
Look, I like hanging out with you guys,

227
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,180
但我绝不会为莫须有的罪名道歉
but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.

228
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,550
事实上  严格来说  你真的有做
Well, actually, technically, you did do it.

229
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
那是一振  莱纳德
That's strike one, Leonard.

230
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,650
这是你的油炸玉米粉饼
There you go: quesadilla.

231
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,220
沙拉
Salad.

232
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,820
还有你的披萨
There's your pizza.

233
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,780
在谢尔顿和本餐厅经理经过
And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion

234
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,850
热烈讨论后
with my manager

235
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,450
一份烧烤汁加上熏肉奶酪分开放的
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

236
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,180
烤肉芝士汉堡送上
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

237
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,580
谢谢
Thank you.

238
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,220
别客气  尽情吃
Go ahead. Eat it.

239
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,330
有种就吃
I dare you

240
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,540
就是这里  找到了 我找到了全美超模
That's it. There's the house. I foundAmerica's top models!

241
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,580
真的吗
Are you sure?

242
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,740
看啊  房顶上
Look, on the roof.

243
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,310
阿娜伊斯和吉赛尔在晒日光浴
Anais and Giselle are sunbathing.

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,680
还是欧式的
European-style.

245
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,980
单从google的卫星地图  你就能把她们认出吗
You can recognize people on Google Earth?

246
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,480
当然不是
Of course not.

247
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,480
一个在北美防空联合司令部的哥们派了架间谍机去监视
I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

248
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,080
北美防空联合司令部  你还动用了军用飞机
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

249
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,240
它被设定任务 去西伯利亚核反应堆周边巡逻
It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

250
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,480
我也最多借来用一个小时
I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

251
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,480
好了  他在哪
Okay, where is he?

252
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,040
谢尔顿吗  我载他去了漫画店  怎么了
Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?

253
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,310
这  试试上网
Here. Try and go online.

254
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,010
-无线上网有问题吗  -你试试啊
Problem with the WiFi? Just try.

255
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
你好  乱抓汉堡的人
Greetings, hamburger toucher.

256
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,110
或许你在讶异
You are probably wondering

257
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,610
为什么你不能上网和朋友去聊一下
why you cannot IM with your little friends

258
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,380
你的生活是多么如此这般美妙
about how much you "heart" various things.

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,140
这段录像是在警告你
This recorded message is alerting you

260
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,680
你偷用我们的无线上网账号的日子
that I am putting an end

261
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,080
已经一去不复返
to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi.

262
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,340
如果你想补救现状
If you want to remedy the situation,

263
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,410
你就自个儿打电话给电讯公司
you can contact the phone company,

264
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,980
自己开个无线账号  自己付钱  或者你可以跟我道歉
set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.

265
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,310
看
Well?

266
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,580
早说了  卑躬屈膝
I reiterate: knuckle under.

267
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
不不不  我要宣战了
No, no, no, no, no. It is on.

268
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,440
我要给你那位朋友点颜色瞧瞧
I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.

269
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,510
佩妮  没人想要跟谢尔顿 对着干
Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon.

270
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,240
这人是从超级恶人实验室 事故里逃出来的
The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.

271
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,880
我不管  我以前还是牛仔呢
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.

272
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,940
不用一分钟  我就可以把他五花大绑还阉了
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

273
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,340
别这样对一个书呆子嘛
No need to neuter the nerd.

274
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,980
我能帮你上网
I can get you back online.

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,440
看  问题解决了
There, see? Problem solved.

276
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,580
好啦[依地语  犹太人使用的国际语]
Voil?

277
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,480
你好啊  小虫子
SHELDON: Hello, puny insects.

278
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,840
作为和我对着干的惩罚
As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will,

279
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,780
你们每人都额外增加一振
everyone is awarded one additional strike.

280
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,780
多亏你啊  霍华德
Thanks a lot, Howard.

281
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,240
你在哪里啰嗦什么
What are you complaining about?

282
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,710
我还要去接受他的教育
I'm the one who has to take the class again.

283
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,380
你好
Hello.

284
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,510
要去洗衣服吗
Time to do your laundry, huh?

285
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,510
周六晚嘛
It's Saturday night.

286
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,480
周六是洗衣之夜
Saturday is laundry night.

287
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,310
我知道
I know.

288
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,080
每个周六的8点15分
Every Saturday at 8:15.

289
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,380
老少咸宜
Easy to anticipate.

290
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,610
你这是什么意思
What are you implying?

291
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,610
我在说你是一个有生活习惯的人
I'm implying that you're a creature of habit.

292
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,410
如果因为某些事  周六晚上8点15分
And if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry

293
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,980
不能洗衣服
on Saturday at 8:15,

294
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,340
你会觉得
you might find it...

295
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,740
不爽
unpleasant.

296
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,180
甘拜下风吧
Knuckle under? My ass.

297
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,040
不是吧  所有的机器都有人用
Oh, no, are all the machines taken?

298
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,940
你该怎么办呢
What are you gonna do?

299
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,080
没问题
No problem.

300
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,780
换一个晚上再洗好了
I'll just do my laundry another night.

301
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,910
换一个晚上
Another night?

302
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,010
好吧  尽管试试
Well, I guess you can try,

303
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,740
但你内心深处
but deep inside your heart,

304
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,910
你知道洗衣之夜永远是周六晚上
you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.

305
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,980
女人  你在和一个智慧比你高的多的人较劲
Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.

306
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,240
让你那高人一等的智慧见鬼去吧
Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.

307
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,510
谢尔顿  谢尔顿
Sheldon. Sheldon!

308
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,180
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

309
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,940
怎么啦
Yes?

310
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,540
我的衣服都去哪儿了
Where are my clothes?

311
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,440
-你的衣服  -对  我把它们放在滚筒里洗
Your clothes? Yes, I left them in the washers

312
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,040
后来我再下去拿的时候它们就不见了
and when I went down to get them, they were gone.

313
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,610
真的吗
Really?

314
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,110
你没见那块牌子上写"不要远离在洗的衣物"么
Despite the sign that says "Do not leave laundry unattended"?

315
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,080
谢尔顿  我的衣服在哪儿
Sheldon, where are my clothes?

316
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,380
好像我是记得看到过一些女式内衣什么的
You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments.

317
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,740
在哪儿呢
Where was that?

318
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,340
哦对
Oh, yes...

319
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,280
就是没多久之前
Earlier this evening,

320
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,280
我碰巧在眺望窗外的景色
I happened to gaze out the window

321
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,910
居然看到了一副罩罩
and a brassiere caught my eye.

322
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,580
你看看那个是不是呢
Do those look familiar?

323
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,840
你他娘的怎么把我衣服弄到电话线上去了
How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?

324
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,410
当你领悟到物理学的真谛之后  佩妮
When you understand the laws of physics, Penny,

325
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,180
一切皆有可能
anything is possible.

326
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,740
我能不能再加一句  木哈哈
And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.

327
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,510
拿回来
Get them down.

328
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,780
-道歉  -绝不
Apologize. Never.

329
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,880
那你就去准备一根长棍子
Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick

330
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,310
然后开始玩"挑裤衩"吧
and play panty pinata.

331
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,980
等等  谢尔顿  我们做得过头了
Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?

332
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,340
我干了一些蠢事
I've done some stupid things.

333
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,640
你也干了一些蠢事
You've done some stupid things.

334
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,280
我们就算扯平  大家平安度日  怎么样啊
How about we just call it even and move on with our lives?

335
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,940
我才没做蠢事
I've done no stupid things.

336
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,710
我已经作出让步了  你也应该有所表示
Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.

337
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,280
我有表示的
I am meeting you halfway.

338
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,480
我非常愿意承认  你做了一些蠢事
I'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things.

339
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,080
你们又开始说话了啊  太好了
Hey, you guys are talking again. Good.

340
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,340
又咋了
What happened?

341
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,980
莱纳德  记得我说我跟他较上了吗
Leonard, remember when I said it was on?

342
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,140
现在看来我要跟他没完了
Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

343
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,380
不是吧
Oh, not junior rodeo.

344
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,910
你干啥了
What did you do?

345
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,680
是她逼我的  莱纳德
I had no choice, Leonard.

346
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,680
她毁了我的洗衣之夜
She ruined laundry night.

347
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,410
木哈哈
Mwuh-ha-ha.

348
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,340
电话线不会把我电死的  对吧
Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?

349
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,110
不会  你是不是该收手了
No. Look, this has to stop.

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,180
不不不  这才刚开始呢
Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.

351
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,980
好吧  我实在是不想这么干  不过
All right, I really didn't want to do this, but...

352
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,680
给
here.

353
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,510
这是什么
What's this?

354
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,710
谢尔顿的致命弱点[超人剧集里的物质]
Sheldon's Kryptonite.

355
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,680
我的天
Oh, my God.

356
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,880
绝对不能告诉他是我给你的
He can never know that I gave that to you.

357
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,980
我是说过要给他点颜色瞧瞧
Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but...

358
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,340
但这也太
but this?

359
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,510
用这个办法能大大缩短你们的战争耗时
It'll shorten the war by five years

360
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,840
从而拯救千百万人民
and save millions of lives.

361
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,540
停下  对了  就是这里
Oh, pause it. That's it. Confirmed.

362
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,840
我们找到超模们的地址了
We now have the address of the Top Model house.

363
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,380
上帝保佑你  谷歌街景注册商标
God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.

364
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,380
你们两个
Okay, for the record,

365
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,280
这么做也太恶心了吧
what you're doing is really creepy.

366
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,940
告诉你  如果使用互联网
You know what? If it's "creepy"

367
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,840
还有军用卫星和机器飞艇
to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft

368
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,140
来定位一幢装满了火辣模特的房子
to find a house full of gorgeous young models

369
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,180
好让我不时去访问一下她们能叫"恶心"的话
so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly,

370
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,280
就好吧  就算我"恶心"好了
then fine, I'm "creepy."

371
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,640
喂
Hello.

372
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,880
你好  好的  稍等一下  我去叫他
Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him.

373
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,980
谢尔顿  你的电话
Sheldon, it's for you.

374
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
-谁打来的  -你妈妈
Who is it? Your mother.

375
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,980
好的
Oh, good.

376
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,340
妈妈  你好吗
Hi, Mom. How are you?

377
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,140
但  妈妈
But, Mom...

378
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,610
她老是坐我的专座
she keeps sitting in my spot.

379
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,540
还碰我的食物
And-and she touched my food.

380
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,540
是的  我是拿了她衣服  不过是她先挑拨我的
Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it...

381
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,140
这太不公平了
No, that's not fair.

382
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,710
为什么我要去道歉
Why should I have to apologize?

383
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,140
我认为这点小事
Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing

384
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,180
耶稣是不会来关心的
Jesus concerns himself with.

385
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,610
好吧我错了
No, you're right.

386
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,140
我不可能知道耶稣在想什么
I don't really know what Jesus thinks about.

387
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,840
好吧  再见
All right, good-bye.

388
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,410
是你告发我的吗
Did you tell on me?

389
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,880
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

390
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,440
我已经被两振了
I already have two strikes.

391
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,840
佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny.

392
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,640
佩妮
Penny.

393
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,710
我非常非常抱歉  我错了
I am very, very sorry for what I have done.

394
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,940
这是你的衣服
Here's your laundry.

395
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,680
我把你被振的次数清零了
I rescind your strikes

396
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,610
同样还取消对你的驱逐令
and you are no longer banished.

397
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,040
我能随便坐哪儿吗
Can I sit wherever I want?

398
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,210
算了  算了
Never mind, never mind.

399
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,880
那个不重要
That's, that's not important.

400
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,810
谢尔顿  你的气量很大
Sheldon, this was big of you.

401
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,440
谢谢  我非常感谢你
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

402
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,680
谢谢
Thank you.

403
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,180
晚安  谢尔顿
Good night, Sheldon.

404
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,640
佩妮
Penny...

405
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,880
怎么
Yes?

406
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,840
你够狠
Well played.

407
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,240
谢谢
