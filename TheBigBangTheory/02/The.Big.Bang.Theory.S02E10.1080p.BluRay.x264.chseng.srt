1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,630
我什么都没看到  谢尔顿
I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,500
你是医生我听你的  但确实 老有烦人的声音在我耳边响
Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
没错
Me, too.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,900
是一种高频的口哨声吗
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,900
不  是一种时刻不停的
No, it's more of a relentless,

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,530
自以为是的唠叨
narcissistic drone.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,370
没有任何炎症  谢尔顿
Yup, there's no inflammation at all, Sheldon.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,670
那我肯定得肿瘤了
Then it must be a tumor.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,270
我深表怀疑
I Seriously doubt it.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,270
也许是以前小时候常把头塞进马桶冲水
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,500
造成的永久性细菌感染
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,230
真的会这样吗  我以前经常这么干的
Is that possible? I used to get those all the time.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,970
甚至在教堂里
Even in church.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,930
如果是因为这个的话  我倒有个办法
Well if it is from a swirly, there something I can do.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,800
圈  圈  点  点
Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot,

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,900
虱子不再烦扰你[美国儿歌]
now you have a cootie shot!

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,830
我去睡觉了
I'm going to bed

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
好的  我马上就来
Okay, I'll be right in.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,930
她不光是在嘲笑我  而且
It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,170
把打预防针的流程也搞错了
the correct procedure for a cootie shot.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,000
你知道斯蒂芬妮到这里来不是为了
Do you understand that Stephanie's not here

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,970
帮你治疗你那些臆想的毛病吧?
to treat your imaginary ailments?

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,830
怎么可能是臆想 我老是听见一种高于中央C的八度音
How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C?

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,900
这是臆想吗
Is that imaginary?

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,200
我看不是
I don't think so.

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,100
晚安
Good night.

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,670
莱纳德  还有件事
Leonard,there's one more thing.

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,830
根据我们的合租协议第一章第三段
Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,370
我要召开一个紧急会议
I'm calling an emergency meeting.

30
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,430
你不是吧
No, you're not.

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,420
莱纳德提议不要开会
Leonard moves the meeting not occur.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,230
有人同意么  没有  提议不予采纳
Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails.

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,170
在会议的开头  我想祝贺你
I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,930
和斯蒂芬妮医生恋情有了进展
on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,330
谢谢
Thank you.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,430
那也就是说  我们必须讨论
That being said, we have to discuss

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,230
对于"同居"附加条例的执行问题
the implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,570
因为你们两人现在
whichas been activated now that

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,430
已经住在一起了
the two of you are living together.

40
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,890
我们没有啊
We're not living together.

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,590
我有不同意见
I beg to disagree

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,910
某女性被认定为
"A girlfriend shall be deemed

43
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,010
跟莱纳德  前引号  同居  后引号
quote living with un-quote Leonard

44
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,830
的时间条件是  第一  连续十晚
when she has stayed over for A: ten consecutive nights,

45
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,330
或第二  三周之内超过九晚
or B:  more than nine nights in three week period,

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,850
或第三  一个月之内的所有周末
or C: all the weekends of a given month

47
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,670
再加上三个非周末
plus three weeknights.

48
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,630
这太荒唐了
That's absurd.

49
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,030
你自己都签名了  看  莱  莱  莱
You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,930
我签名的原因是因为 我觉得这些条例永远都用不上的
Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen!

51
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,430
我还签了一条
I initialed another clause

52
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,200
上面说如果我有超能力的话  就让你做我搭档
naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

53
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,870
是啊  没错
Hmm, yes, you did.

54
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,970
我们再来温故一下需要执行哪些条例
Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated:

55
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,200
在冰箱里  我们不能再使用 两个单人层和一个公用层了
In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf,

56
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,630
现在我们三个人每人使用一层 然后冰箱门变作公用
the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,630
下一条  房间清扫工作 应从每周两次增加为每周三次
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,500
以解决日益增加的死皮细胞
to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells.

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,070
第三  厕所使用时间表  我了解到
Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand

60
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,970
女人对厕所的用法有所不同  所以我们应该讨论一下
women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
我去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,730
你至少也得把这带走吧
At least take this with you.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,730
别忘了让斯蒂芬妮签名  这里  这里  这里
Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here...

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
还有  这里
and... here.

65
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,800
这一条规定  从现在起她不能
This states that she does not now

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,070
也不准计划演奏打击乐器或者铜管乐器
nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,970
肯定是肿瘤 压迫听觉神经了
Sure sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第10集

69
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,520
绝对不行
No, absolutely not.

70
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,810
这又没什么
It's not a big deal.

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,850
我们有卫生手套的
We have latex gloves.

72
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,920
我不管你出现了什么症状
I don't care what the symptoms are,

73
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,050
我女朋友是不会帮你做前列腺检查的
my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,450
谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,350
早上好  斯蒂芬妮医生
Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

76
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,390
我想莱纳德昨晚肯定让你性福了吧
I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,890
谢尔顿  这种问题不能随便问的
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

78
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,990
那我怎么总听到你在问啊
I heard you ask it over and over.

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,090
我只问一次怎么就错了
How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?

80
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,920
他非常棒
He did very nicely.

81
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,690
看见没  她不生气
See? She's not offended.

82
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,620
而且你也得到结果了
And now you finally have an answer.

83
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,150
没咖啡了  需要咖啡
Out of coffee. Need coffee.

84
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,120
你好
Oh, hello.

85
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,620
斯蒂芬妮  是吗
Hi! Stephanie, right?

86
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,090
是  你...你是
Uh-huh. And-And- And you are?

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,220
佩妮  我就住对门
Penny, I live across the hall.

88
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,350
我听说了你很多事情
I've heard a lot about you.

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,490
是吗
Really? Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,820
怎么没人跟我提起你啊
I haven't heard a thing about you.

91
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,250
莱纳德
Leonard?

92
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,490
为什么你从来都没跟我说起过
Why haven't I heard a thing

93
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,650
这个住在你对门的
about this woman who lives across the hall

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,120
喜欢早上跑这儿来的女人  还穿着内衣
and comes into your apartment in the morning...in her underwear?

95
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,350
她听说过你是因为
She's heard about you because we're, you know,

96
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,650
你是我女朋友  而你没听说过她则是因为
involved and you haven't heard about her because...

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,350
我从没跟她上过床  我发誓
I never slept with her, I swear!

98
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,520
不过话说回来  这倒并不是因为莱纳德不想
In Leonard's defense, it wasn't for lack of trying.

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,450
谢谢你  谢尔顿
Thank you, Sheldon.

100
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,790
别客气  莱纳德
You're welcome, Leonard.

101
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,190
我的意思是
Look, I'm just saying, um...

102
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,580
佩妮是我们众多邻居中的一位
Penny is one of our many neighbors, you know,

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,250
在我们这幢楼里  邻居们进进出出  很随便的  不讲究穿着
and in our building, neighbors come and go, it's very casual, no dress code.

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,280
实际上  有好几天早上  我都是穿着睡衣
In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor

105
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,940
荡到三楼瓦塔比蒂安太太家里跟她一起吃麦片的
in my pajamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

106
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,310
真的吗
Really?

107
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,500
我怎么从来都没被瓦塔比蒂安太太
I have never once been invited

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,490
邀请去共进麦片的
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

109
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,590
她看你不爽
She doesn't like you.

110
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,550
你不是要去切除什么胆囊么
You have a gall bladder to remove and I have

111
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,650
我要去洗澡了  而佩妮要穿衣服了
to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so...

112
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,720
很高兴能见到你
Well, it was very nice meeting you.

113
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,320
我也很高兴终于见到你了
Nice to finally meet you, too.

114
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
我们今天晚上见?
And I'll see you tonight?

115
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,990
好的  再见
Okay, bye-bye.

116
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,550
我到底做了什么事情  招惹到了瓦塔比蒂安太太
What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?

117
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,620
那就是斯蒂芬妮啊
So, that's Stephanie, huh?

118
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,520
为什么我感觉我被做了前列腺检查
Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?

119
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,420
她人挺好的
You know, she seems very nice.

120
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,420
没错  她太棒了
Oh, she is. She's terrific.

121
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,250
真的是一位好室友
And she's proving to be a valuable roommate.

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,790
室友?  你们住一起了?
Roommate? You guys are living together?

123
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,120
想嬉皮士一样
Like hippies.

124
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,750
我们没同居
We're not living together.

125
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,420
你还想看看那些条款吗
Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?

126
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,020
我们没同居
We're not living together.

127
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,250
你确定吗
Are you sure?

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,090
我怎么可能不确定
How could I not be sure?

129
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,920
我们试试就知道了
Well, let's find out.

130
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,050
你觉得如果一个女人和我同居的话
Don't you think if a woman was living with me

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,450
我会意识不到么
I'd be the first one to know about it?

132
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,750
亲爱的  你肯定是那个最后知道的
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it.

133
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,720
很漂亮的衣服嘛
Hmm, cute dresses.

134
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,120
我打赌你穿这个会很好看
I bet this looks great on you!

135
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,190
我们没有同居
We're not living together.

136
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,450
好吧
Okay, hmm...

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,290
香氛蜡烛  毛毛拖鞋
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers,

138
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,090
碎花床单
Ooh! Floral bed sheets?

139
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,020
我们没有同居
We're not living together.

140
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,950
好吧  我继续
Okay, moving on.

141
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,920
迪斯尼乐园里这两位是谁呀
Now, who are these guys at Disney World?

142
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,890
那个大狗叫高飞
Uh, the big dog is Goofy,

143
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,920
那两个戴米奇耳朵的大人我就不知道了
but the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea.

144
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,950
我们没有同居
We're not living together!

145
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,590
还不承认嘛
You're going to go down swinging, huh?

146
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,150
好吧  看看你的护肤乳液
All right, well, we got your body lotion,

147
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,290
你的瑞丽杂志  你的首饰盒
your InStyle Magazine, your jewelry box.

148
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,750
我们没有
We're not--

149
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,950
我的蝙蝠侠信号灯去哪了
Where's my Bat Signal?

150
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,390
你有一个蝙蝠侠信号灯
You have a Bat Signal?

151
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:07,020
我是有过  之前就放这了
I did. It was right here.

152
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,490
一定是她  天呐  我们是同居了
She must've-- Oh, my God, we're living together.

153
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,150
真的吗  你是怎么发现的
Really? What was your first clue?

154
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,990
新裤子
New pants?

155
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,250
是啊  斯蒂芬妮买给我的
Yeah, Sthanie got them for me.

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,590
不错嘛  棉的
Nice. Cotton?

157
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,250
事实上  我觉得更像是羊毛和火红蚁的混合物
Actually, I think it's more of wool, fire ant blend.

158
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,320
这么说你的女朋友替你买衣服啦
So, the girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?

159
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,890
很亲密嘛
Sounds serious.

160
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,220
没错
It is actually.

161
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,690
事实上  我也想了很多
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought

162
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,920
我觉得我们是时候搬到一起住了
and I decided it was time for us to live together.

163
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,990
莱纳德  大错特错
Ba Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

164
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,290
外面的女人多的就像自助餐厅里的食物
There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just

165
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,790
你却站在角落里吃着同样的芥末蛋
standing in the corner eating the same deviled egg

166
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,520
日复一日
over and over again.

167
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,750
至少我有鸡蛋吃  你有什么
At least I have an egg. What do you have?

168
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,690
一打随意取用的潜在性伴侣
A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners.

169
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,310
看到那个金发美女了吗
See the blonde over there?

170
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,790
我能去泡她你就不行
I can hit on her and you can't.

171
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,790
去泡啊
So, go hit on her.

172
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,650
她不是我喜欢的类型
She's not my type.

173
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,370
真遗憾  她刚才还偷看你来着呢
Too bad, 'cause she was checking you out before.

174
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,060
她有嘛
She was?

175
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,370
当然没有  看看她
Of course not. Look at her.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,190
我不关心你们怎么想
I don't care what you guys think.

177
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,000
斯蒂芬妮和我住在一起很开心
Stephanie and I are very happy living together.

178
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,650
我愿意给你们20块钱
I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now

179
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
你们谁能跟我换换裤子呀
to trade pants with me.

180
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,290
谢尔顿  你跟这干嘛呢
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

181
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,820
等下
Hang on.

182
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,790
高压130低压80  有点高
130 over 80. A little high.

183
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,320
可能是紧张的缘故
We can attribute that to the stress

184
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,620
因为我得悄悄溜过保安室
of sneaking past the security desk.

185
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,090
你哪来的听诊器呀
Where did you get the stethoscope

186
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,350
还有这个血压袖带
and the blood pressure cuff?

187
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,290
我阿姨玛丽昂给我的12岁生日礼物
My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.

188
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,590
她觉得如果我挂了理论物理
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics

189
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,150
得有个谋生的手艺
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

190
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,850
顺便说一下  那个血压袖带
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
叫做血压计
is called a sphygmomanometer.

192
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,490
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,520
他们在医学院没有教过你吗
Didn't they teach you that in medical school?

194
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,990
我有点忙  谢尔顿
I'm kinda busy here, Sheldon.

195
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,320
我了解
I understand.

196
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,390
我就是需要你授权这些检查
All I need is for you to authorize these tests.

197
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,890
心脏负荷检查  全身磁共振成像
A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI,

198
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,550
肌电图  全血细胞计数  葡萄糖基线
anlectromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose.

199
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,150
上消化道
Upper GI?

200
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,290
还有腹腔镜检查
Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy.

201
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,250
上次我打嗝了  感觉像是我的隔膜
Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm

202
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,920
在向我示意
was just going through the motions.

203
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,790
回家吧  谢尔顿
Go home, Sheldon.

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,520
至少给我做个上消化道检查吧
Can I at least have the upper GI?

205
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,690
我都已经喝了钡水了
I already drank the barium!

206
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,920
太好了  你有衣服柔顺剂嘛
Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?

207
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,520
有啊
Yeah, sure.

208
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,390
你洗什么呢  洗鳄鱼呐
What are you washing? A crocodile?

209
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,350
不是  是斯蒂芬妮买给我的裤子
No, the pants that Stephanie got me.

210
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,920
亲爱的  这种裤子不能机洗的
Oh, sweetie, you can't machinwash these.

211
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,990
洗了就毁了
They'll be ruined.

212
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,420
-真的吗  -没错
-Are you sure? -Absolutely.

213
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,080
不要吧  你早点告诉我就好了
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

214
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,300
你们有什么状况么
Are you guys having problems?

215
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
我们都很好啊
No, everything's fine.

216
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,500
真的么
Really?

217
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,430
是啊  很好啊
Yeah. It's wonderful.

218
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,570
好吧  可能住在一起这件事
Okay, maybe this whole living together

219
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,540
发生得太快了  但没有问题的  挺好的
happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.

220
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,680
好吧莱纳德  亲爱的你知道
Okay, Leonard, honey, you know,

221
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,570
如果你对于你们的关系感到不自在了
if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going,

222
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,800
你是可以讲出来的
you're allowed to say something.

223
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,870
真的么  听起来不大对劲
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

224
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,030
相信我  你的感受和她的一样重要
Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.

225
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,570
这个听起来也不对劲
No that doesn't sound right either.

226
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,430
就直接告诉她你想要
Just tell her you need the relationship to move

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,270
慢慢来
at a pace that you both are comfortable with.

228
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,930
好吧  我可以这么和她说
Yeah, I could say something like that to her.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,970
我这就去说
I'll go do that.

230
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,130
谢了
Thank you.

231
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,270
没事
Sure.

232
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,230
你很擅长这个嘛
You have a really good grasp on this.

233
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,400
你和她谈谈是不是更好
Maybe you could talk to her?

234
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,170
你开玩笑呢吧
You're kidding, right?

235
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,070
没有  不过没关系
No, but that's okay.

236
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,570
我去和她谈
I'll go talk to her.

237
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,610
你想和我一起去嘛
Want to come with?

238
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,260
快去
Go!

239
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,420
不是吧
Oh, no.

240
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,220
怎么咧
Whaa??

241
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,290
你说对了  你嗓子发炎了
You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

242
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,820
我是说  我从来没见过更糟糕的了
I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

243
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,220
我就知道
I knew it!

244
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,980
我该怎么办
What do I do?!

245
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,980
你必须马上停止说话
You're going to need to stop talking immediately.

246
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,650
要多久
For how-- Dut-dut-dut.

247
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,820
现在开始
Immediately.

248
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,450
亲爱的
Hey. Oh, hi, honey.

249
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,350
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

250
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,650
出什么事了
What's going on?

251
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,880
我刚给他来了个谢尔顿切除手术
I just performed a "Sheldonectomy."

252
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,250
小心点  如果没痊愈  下次会更厉害
Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.

253
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
知道了
Gotcha.

254
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,150
听着  我们得谈谈
Listen, we need to talk.

255
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,080
我们谈谈吧 还是我们得谈谈
Do we need to talk or "do we need to talk"?

256
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,680
你说什么呢
I don't know what that means.

257
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,580
好吧  你为什么不直接告诉我 你想要告诉我什么
Okay, why don't you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?

258
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,780
好的  那个  就是
Okay, um, well, look, it's just that...

259
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,720
你我的进展太快了
things between you and me have been going pretty quick.

260
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,180
然后捏
And...?

261
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,320
我有点怕怕
It's just a little scary.

262
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,220
又惊又喜那种对吧
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

263
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,880
当然
Sure...

264
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,050
怕怕什么时候不是又惊又喜呢
When is scary not good?

265
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,550
但是  我也有感受的对吧
But... okay, um, I have feelings, right?

266
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,750
好的  那么我表述我的感觉
Okay, and it's perfectly okay

267
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,750
应该没有关系对吧
to express those feelings, right?

268
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,080
当然  亲爱的你为什么不 告诉我你的感受呢
Of course honey why don't you tell me what it is you're feeling?

269
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,150
好的  我就是觉得我们得
Okay, well, I ju... I think it's important to remember

270
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,080
按照我们的步调前进
that we move at a pace that is our speed

271
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,020
囧  我背下来的
and-- Oh, shoot, I had it!

272
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,420
好吧  这样如何
Okay, how about this?

273
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,650
让我说说我的感觉如何
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

274
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,680
怎么了
What's that?

275
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,050
真的假的  现在吗
Really? Right now?

276
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,880
为什么不
Why not?

277
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,950
刚吃了饭的  饭后不是不能剧烈运动吗
I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

278
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,550
是不能游泳吧
I think that's for swimming.

279
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,580
好吧
Oh, okay.

280
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
我就希望我不会抽筋就行了
I just hope I don't get cramps.

281
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,750
我把你的衣服放到烘干机里了
Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.

282
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,980
谢谢
Thank you.

283
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,180
-你的裤子毁了  -太好了
-Your pants are ruined. -Good.

284
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,680
你和斯蒂芬妮谈的如何
So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?

285
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,480
某种意义上讲  谈得超好
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

286
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,220
你告诉她你想慢点来啦
So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?

287
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,820
没有讲得这么明确
Not specifically,

288
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,780
不过我的确告诉她了我的感受
but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.

289
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,750
很好嘛  然后呢
Good, good. And then what?

290
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,250
然后啊  主题就变了
And then, uh, the subject got changed somehow.

291
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
你们上床啦  对吧
You had sex, didn't you?

292
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,950
上了一小下
Um... little bit.

293
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,020
什么
What?

294
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,750
没什么
Nothing.

295
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,650
好吧  听起来进展顺利
Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.

296
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,950
是啊  都很好
Yeah, it's all good.

297
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,150
所有问题都会化解
Everything's going to work out.

298
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,250
不管是怎么化解的
One way or another.

299
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,420
拜托  莱纳德
come on, Leonard,

300
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,950
你有权利试着 让事情按照你喜欢的方式来
You are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.

301
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,380
-真的吗  -是的
-Really? -Yes!

302
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,180
你不一定总是要顺着女人的意思
You don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.

303
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,020
什么
What?

304
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,080
没什么  就是在重新思考我的整个人生
Nothing. Just... rethinking my whole life.

305
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,380
好吧  事情是这样的
Okay, here's the thing.

306
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,020
我害怕如果我要她搬出去  她会甩了我
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,680
那你就得冒这个险
Well, it's a chance you have to take.

308
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,320
我是说  如果注定要这样  躲也躲不过
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

309
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,720
真会安慰人
Very comforting.

310
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,020
好吧  我怎么和她说
Okay, so what do I say to her?

311
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,380
我不知道
I don't know.

312
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,820
我的意思是别的女人想要和你慢慢来 她们是怎么说的
I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?

313
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,680
我真的很喜欢你 但我想看看和马克会怎样
I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?

314
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,120
是  那倒是可以让你们的关系慢下来
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

315
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,800
抱歉  我打断你了
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.

316
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,830
你刚才说什么来着
What were you saying?

317
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,770
对  恩
Oh, right, yeah, um...

318
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,630
斯蒂芬妮  是这样的
So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

319
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,900
我真的很喜欢你
I really like you.

320
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,170
噢  天哪  你要说那番话了
Oh, God, here comes the speech.

321
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,300
什么话
What speech?

322
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,030
我真的很喜欢你
"I really like you,

323
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,800
但我们或许相处的时间应该再少一点
"but maybe we should spend a little less time together

324
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,870
因为我想要有一点私人空间 但我会周二打电话给你的
"'cause I need my space but I'll call you on Tuesday"

325
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,310
接着你再也不会打电话给我了 所以只能我打给你  但你不会回我
and then you never call me so I call you,but you don't call me back

326
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,800
接着当我某天在咖啡馆遇见你
and then when I run into you at the coffee shop,

327
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,200
你假装你的语音信箱
you pretend like you've been having problems

328
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,370
好像坏了  但我知道你是在撒谎
with your voice mail and I know that you're lying,

329
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,830
但我假装不在乎 即使在心里我已经想死你了
but I pretend like I don't care even though I'm dying inside!

330
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,770
不是的
No!

331
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,000
不  不是的  我不会那样说的
No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that.

332
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,700
我刚才是想说
I was just going to say...

333
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,870
我是真的很喜欢你
I really like you.

334
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,300
噢  太好了
Oh, good!

335
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,500
因为我也真的很喜欢你
'Cause I really like you, too.

336
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,570
棒极了[同义:太糟了]
Terrific.

337
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,830
嘿
Hey.

338
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,770
-嘿  -嘿
- Hey.- Hey.

339
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,470
毛衣挺不错的嘛
nice sweater.

340
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,270
恩  斯蒂芬妮给我买的  这衣服挺有趣的
Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.

341
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,170
上面有一只大鸟诶  老兄
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

342
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,930
是  是的  这就是它有趣的地方嘛
Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part.

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,100
我们还把我的卧室换了新窗帘
We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom,

344
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,500
还有一个新床罩  和一床羽绒被
and a dust ruffle, and a duvet,

345
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,330
而我甚至都不知道羽绒被是什么东西
and I don't even know what a duvet is,

346
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
但我敢肯定不会是我想要的
but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one,

347
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,670
但我每次和她说搬出去住的事情
but every time I talk to her about moving out,

348
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,200
她就哭起来然后和我做爱
she cries and we have sex.

349
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,270
你真幸运  和我在一起  通常会是另一种结果
You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.

350
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,570
你知道吗  如果你不忍心当面说 为什么不发短信跟她说呢
You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?

351
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,830
不觉得这有点像懦夫的行为吗
Isn't that kind of cowardly?

352
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,770
哦  是的  但总比被欺骗好吧
Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

353
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,770
是的 但是另一方面你正穿着一件有鸟的毛衣
It's true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.

354
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,430
同意
Sold.

355
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:29,500
我想这会使我们的关系更好 如果你搬回你的地方去住
"I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place."

356
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,370
看  搞定了
There. It's done.

357
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,130
你真棒
Good for you.

358
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,770
是的  我真棒   我再也不能享受到性爱了
Yeah, good for me. I'll never have sex again.

359
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,770
我错了  回头见
I was wrong.See ya.

360
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,640
佩妮
Penny.

361
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,610
佩妮
Penny.

362
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,380
佩妮
Penny.

363
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,180
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

364
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,840
我喉咙发炎了
COMPUTER: I have an inflamed larynx.

365
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
什么事啊
Okay?

366
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,710
我们的药草茶喝完了  你有吗
COMPUTER: We're out of herbal tea. Do you have any?

367
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,510
好的  让我找找啊
Okay, let me check.

368
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,610
有肛门也不错
COMPUTER: Some hiney would be nice, too.

369
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,810
肛门[肛门的俚语 较粗俗 但也很流行]
Hiney?

370
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,040
是蜂蜜
COMPUTER: Honey.
