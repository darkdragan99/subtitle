1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,450
知道了吧 你吃的这个 不算是真的酸奶酪
so you see what you eating is not technically yogurt,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,090
因为里面没有足够的 活的嗜酸培养菌
because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,600
只不过是冰牛奶里加了点 角叉胶 增加粘稠度
It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,710
喔 真有意思哈
Oh,that's very interesting.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,710
它也不真是粉红色 也没有天然浆果粒
It's also not pink and has no berries.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,190
嗯 可这也没有回答我的问题呐
Yeah,but it doesn't really answer my question.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,730
你问的啥问题?
What was your question again?

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,910
你要来点儿不?
Do you want some?

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,880
对对 不用了
Right. No.

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,240
- 我受不了乳糖的 - 对哦
- I'm lactose intolerant. - Right.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,730
- 吃了会放屁的 - 好吧 明白了
- So,gas. - Yeah,got it.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,570
那么... 晚安了
Well... good night.

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,720
你这是做什么呢?
What are you doing?

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,390
哦 那边有阵风
Oh,there's a draft.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
我没觉得有风啊
I didn't feel a draft.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,950
那我们还是去... 你的...
Why don't we just go into,uh,your...

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,850
我说 也许我们不该那么着急
Yeah,you know what,maybe we should slow things down a little.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,700
不 我不是说要去你公寓 去急着干嘛干嘛
No,no,I didn't mean to go into your apartment to go fast.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,720
当然了 我知道
No,I know.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,620
我知道你不是那意思 只是... 这才是咱俩第一次约会
I know what you meant,it's just... this is only our first date.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,020
嗯 好啊 没问题
Yeah,okay,sure,no problem.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,890
那我们就先想想 下次要去哪儿 准备啥时候到那儿
Why don't we just figure out where we're going and when we want to get there,

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,670
这样距离除以时间 就知道速度了呗
and then rate of speed equals distance over time.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
问题解决
Solve for R.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,260
我们也可以到时候再想嘛
Or we could just wing it.

26
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,900
那没准也行
That might work,too.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,000
- 晚安 莱纳德- 晚安
- Good night,Leonard. - Good night.

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,270
他来了 快上屏保!
He's coming-- screensaver!

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,400
嘿 莱纳德约会怎么样哇?
Oh,hey,Leonard. How was your date?

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,470
要你管
Bite me.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,050
谢尔顿 你怎么能傻坐着 眼睁睁看他们监视我呢?
Sheldon,how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
他们油菜啊 莱纳德
They were clever,Leonard.

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,630
他们完全明白 我对你那些破事儿 一点兴趣没有
They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,250
你还该谢谢我们呢
You should thank us.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,980
要是后来人想弄明白 你和佩妮的恋情为啥会土崩瓦解
When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,280
这玩意儿就是黑匣子呐!
this right here is the black box.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,930
你胡说什么 约会挺好的
What are you talking about? The date went fine.

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,940
拜托 她都说了 想要慢慢来
Dude,she said she wants to slow things down.

39
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,060
好吧 她是说了 想要慢慢来
Okay,so she said she wants to slow things down.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,030
意思差不多就是 "今天的晚餐我非常喜欢
It's like saying,"I'm really enjoying this meal.

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,410
我得慢慢来 好好回味一下"
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,780
才怪 她的意思是 "这鱼真难吃死了
No,it's like,"This fish tastes bad,

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,030
我得慢慢来 吐光了它"
so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out."

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,190
- 这臭鱼说的就是你! - 我才不是这臭鱼呢
- You being the fish. - I'm not the fish.

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,430
真的? 你俩定了下一次约会吗?
Oh,really? Did you make a second date?

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,330
这倒没有... 我们说好了 到时候再想
Well,no,we sort of decided to wing it.

47
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,450
得了吧 连我都觉得这太逊了
Oh,even I know that's lame.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,670
行啊 咱就说说你的假设
Okay,all right,let's assume your hypothesis.

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,140
我们一起去吃饭 有说有笑 有吻有抱
We went to dinner,we talked,we laughed,we kissed.

50
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
这还能错到哪儿去啊?
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,190
你好好想想 莱纳德
Think back,Leonard.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,320
再小的事情都能让女人爆发
The littlest things can set women off.

53
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,200
比方说 "嘿 这服务生真辣 我打赌 肯定能让她跟咱回家"
Like,"Hey,the waitress is hot,I bet we could get her to come home with us."

54
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,020
或者 "你妈妈有多重呐?
Or,"How much does your mom weigh?

55
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,410
我想知道我搭上的是啥样的妞儿"
I want to know what I'm getting into."

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,830
这种话我才不会说
I didn't say anything like that.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
很好 因为这么说不管用
Good,'cause they don't work.

58
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,440
她们也不关心 你是不是盯着她们 呼吸加速
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

59
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,510
挺惨的 在我们家 这就像是家族传统
Sadly,that's my home run swing.

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,820
我说 一切都挺好的
Look,everything went fine.

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,120
连事先准备的一些开场白都没用到呢
I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters.

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,970
走廊对面那个女孩 就是喜欢我嘛
That woman across the hall is into me.

63
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,790
咱还是看带子吧
Let's go to the tape.

64
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,890
你瞧她临别一吻的时候 那反应
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss.

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,410
呼吸平稳 瞳孔没有放大 胸口也没啥起伏
No change in respiration,pupils un-dilated,no flushing of the chest.

66
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,330
这特写镜头拍的真赞
Nice close-up,by the way.

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,990
有意思嘿 她的下巴很紧 也没有用舌头
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched: no tongue access.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,790
对于寻偶期的人类来说 这可不是啥好消息
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,430
这怎么就不是好消息了
That's not a bad sign.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,720
得了吧 还不如说你们是两只鬣蜥 只是喉部没有垂肉罢了
Please,you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,960
最糟的就是 这会儿你不在她家 而在这里!
And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there.

72
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,120
我不在她家 因为我也决定慢慢来 这个...
I'm not there because I'm taking things slow,which,

73
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,230
跟你们比起来 都快接近星际速度了
by the way,compared to you guys,approaches warp speed.

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,670
快把摄像头给我撤了
And take down that camera.

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,000
他心里没牵没挂的时候 真有意思多了
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,380
给他点时间吧
Give him time.

77
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,790
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第01集

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,870
你好啊 佩妮
Oh,hi,Penny.

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,940
顺便说句 2号机器的热水不足 别深色浅色混着洗
FYI,the hot water is inadequate on machine two,so colors only,

80
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,850
4号机器呢 洗衣程序中 还是会提前放出织物柔顺剂
and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle,

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,620
所以你那些精致的衣服 还是别用那台了
so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.

82
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,610
谢了
Thanks.

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,590
老天爷啊...
Oh,good Lord...

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,210
你还不如把衣服拿到河边 搁在石头上猛捶一阵
why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,130
谢尔顿 我问你个问题行不?
Sheldon,can I ask you a question?

86
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,600
我当然最好你别问 不过也不会阻止你
I would prefer that you not,but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

87
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,660
那... 我就当你同意了...
All right,I heard yes,so...

88
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,460
我想问问你
Okay,here's my question.

89
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,580
莱纳德以前有没有 跟正常的女孩子约会过?
Has Leonard ever dated,you know,a regular girl?

90
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,960
我想你指的 应该不是消化功能正常吧
Well,I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity.

91
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,200
要是那样的话 我想这问题问的不合适
Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.

92
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,150
我是说 他有没有跟 没那么大学问的女孩子谈过?
No,I meant,has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

93
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:46,560
话说几年前 他确实跟一个 学法国文学的女博士有过一段儿
Well,a few years ago,he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French literature.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,570
这还不算有大学问?
How is that not a brainiac?

95
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,640
理由一 她是法国人
Well,for one thing,she was French.

96
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,090
理由二 她读的是文学
For another,it was literature.

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,610
那你觉得...
So...

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,390
如果我和莱纳德继续好下去 他会不会有一天觉得我很没劲啊?
do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating,he'll eventually get bored with me?

99
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,890
- 那得看情况 - 什么情况?
- That depends. - On what?

100
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,550
- 你懂量子物理吗? - 不懂
- Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? - No.

101
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,420
- 你会说克林贡语(《星际迷航》影片中的外星语)吗? - 不会
- Do you speak Klingon? - No.

102
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,590
- 你会耍牌吗? - 行了 我说...
- You know any card tricks? - Okay,you know what...

103
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,740
我明白了
I get it.

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,230
莱纳德和一个服务员兼二流演员 没有共同语言
Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress-slash-actress

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
而且她还骗他说 上完了社区大学 心里正发慌呢
who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.

106
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,460
你为什么撒谎?
Why would you lie about that?

107
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,590
他总是在说这大学怎样 那个研究生院怎么样 我就...
Well,he was going on and on about this college and that grad school,and I...

108
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,130
我不想让他觉得我很傻很衰嘛
I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser.

109
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,920
你觉得"很傻很衰"的反义词 是"社区大学毕业生"?
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"?

110
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,870
很多成功人士 都是从社区大学毕业的
You know,there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,400
没错 可你哪个都挨不上边
Yeah,but you are neither.

112
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,420
对 好吧 你得替我保密
Right. Okay,look,this is between you and me.

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,950
啥也不要告诉莱纳德
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

114
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,680
- 你要我保守秘密? - 是的
- You're asking me to keep a secret? - Yeah.

115
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,320
那真对不起了 你应该在说出秘密前 表达出要我保密的意思
Well,I'm sorry,but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret,

116
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,650
我好选择 到底要不要替你保密
so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping.

117
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,690
你事后再说 这怎么行呢
You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.

118
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,640
什么?
What?

119
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,060
保守秘密是一项艰巨复杂的任务
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor.

120
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,520
不但要注意说的话
One has to be concerned not only about what one says,

121
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,700
还得注意面部表情 习惯性反应
but about facial expressions,autonomic reflexes.

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,010
我说谎的时候 因为紧张产生的壁虱(tick) 比莱姆关节炎研究设备产生的还多
When I try to deceive,I myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility.

123
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,630
这是笑话啊
It's a joke.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,870
同音词嘛 "tick"是指
It relies on the homonymic relationship between "tick,"

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,830
吸血寄生虫（壁虱） 而"tic"是无意识的肌肉痉挛
the bloodsucking arachnid,and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction.

126
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,120
我自己编的
I made it up myself.

127
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,680
听着 如果莱纳德发现我说谎 我一定羞愧自尽了
Okay,look,if Leonard finds out that I lied,I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,900
生理学上讲是不可能的
Physiologically impossible.

129
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,750
哦 谢尔顿 拜托
Oh,Sheldon,please.

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,140
我是以朋友的名义请求你
Look,I am asking you as a friend.

131
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,200
照你这么说 朋友就要无条件的保守秘密?
So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?

132
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,900
是啊
Well,yeah.

133
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,270
有意思
Interesting.

134
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,070
再一个问题 或许应该这样问
One more question,and perhaps I should have led with this.

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,780
我们什么时候成朋友了?
When did we become friends?

136
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,690
也就是说 要不被总部守护先知选中 我就成不了绿灯侠(漫画人物)
i.e.,I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa,

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,870
但如果给我足够的启动资金和 足够的科研设备 我就能成为蝙蝠侠
but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility,I could be Batman.

138
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,890
- 你能成为蝙蝠侠? - 当然 我就是蝙蝠侠 看见没?
- You could be Batman? - Sure. I'm Batman. See?

139
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,860
- 嗨 伙计们 - 嗨 佩妮
- Hi,guys. - Hi,Penny.

140
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,960
佩妮 你周五晚上有空的话 我们去看电影吧
Penny,if you're not doing anything Friday night,I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

141
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,940
呃 我周五晚上要轮班
Oh,um,you know,I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.

142
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,580
好吧 周六呢?
Okay,what about Saturday?

143
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,730
说不准 经理还没公布排班表呢
You know,I'm not sure; the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet.

144
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,860
- 出来了 我再告诉你? - 很好
- How about I let you know? - Great.

145
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,840
那你知道了就告诉我 好的 那...
So you just let me know when you know. Okay,so...

146
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,890
天呐 我就是那条臭鱼
Oh,God,I am the bad fish.

147
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,100
我哪做错了?
What did I do wrong?

148
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,240
你为什么问我?
Why are you asking me?

149
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,580
你和佩妮的事儿 除了你已经告诉我的 我啥也不知道
I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you have provided me,

150
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,990
我也没有本事学到
nor do I have any method of learning such things.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
- 这话什么意思? - 没什么
- What does that mean? - Nothing.

152
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,490
你说的倒像是 我和佩妮背地里通了气
You seem to be implying an informational back-channel

153
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,810
很明显 这是没有的事
between me and Penny where obviously none exists.

154
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,850
没 我没觉得
No,I didn't.

155
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,610
我想你要注意你的表达了 先生
I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things,sir.

156
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,540
你怎么回事?
What's going on with you?

157
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,470
这问题我也得问问你吧
I might ask you the same question.

158
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,390
那些跟我无关的事儿 你何必非要把我扯进去?
Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me,

159
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,520
都是你和佩妮之间的事 我跟她连话都不怎么说的
but exist between you and Penny,a person to whom I barely speak?

160
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,870
你脸怎么了?
What's wrong with your face?

161
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,170
我脸这样 没啥原因
There's no reason to bring my looks into this.

162
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,650
- 祝你今天过的愉快 莱纳德- 什么?
- Good day,Leonard. - What

163
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,920
我说 "祝你今天过的愉快"
I said,"Good day."

164
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,840
过的愉快?
Good day?

165
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,590
今天还为您供应 新鲜的阿拉斯加大马哈鱼
Also today,we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,190
配上烧汁和糯米饭
and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

167
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,960
今天的汤是...
Our soup of the day is...

168
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,760
你必须将我从我的誓言中解放出来
You must release me from my oath.

169
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,630
谢尔顿 我在工作
Sheldon,I'm working.

170
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,530
你们花几分钟决定一下吧
Why don't you take a minute to decide?

171
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,490
我不能保守你的秘密了 佩妮
I can't keep your secret,Penny.

172
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,150
我就像构象空间里 基于能量的内源蛋白 要折叠起来了 (fold 也有失败的意思)
I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein in conformational space.

173
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,270
就像是文艺复兴时期的三联画 (教堂祭坛上的饰物 两翼可向内折叠)
Like a Renaissance tryptich.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,210
还有廉价的西装
Like a cheap suit.

175
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,440
你保守个小秘密 咋就这么难呢?
Look,why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?

176
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,520
我天生就保守不住!
I'm constitutionally incapable.

177
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,400
所以我上次申请那项高端政府研究奖学金 证明开不出来
That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship

178
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,770
项目里的超级对撞机 位于密歇根州 特拉弗斯城东南12.5英里的
at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station

179
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,340
一个空设的农学院地下
12.5 miles southeast of Traverse City,Michigan.

180
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,970
我没告诉过你啊
Which you did not hear about from me.

181
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,710
你就别老记着我说过...
Look,just forget I told you about me...

182
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,000
社区大学没毕业 好吗?
not graduating from community college,okay?

183
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,610
别老记着? 这能忘得掉吗?
Forget? You want me to forget?

184
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,090
我这脑子 啥东西忘得掉啊!
This mind does not forget.

185
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,440
从我妈给我断奶后 我就没忘掉过一件事
I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

186
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,800
- 那天是周二 下着毛毛雨 - 好了...
- It was a drizzly Tuesday. - Okay...

187
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,370
你答应过我要保守秘密
Look,you promised me you would keep my secret,

188
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,650
那你就想个办法别漏嘴
so you're just gonna have to figure out a way to do it.

189
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,110
莱纳德我要搬出去
Leonard,I'm moving out.

190
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,220
什么叫"要搬出去"? 为什么?
What do you mean you're moving out? Why?

191
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,140
不一定非要有理由嘛
There doesn't have to be a reason.

192
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
是啊 总该有吧
Yeah,there kinda does.

193
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,240
不一定非得有
Not necessarily.

194
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,120
这是Munchausen三难推理的典型例子
This is a classic example of Munchausen's Trilemma.

195
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,330
要么就是 这个前提通过一系列 不断弱化的次前提 已经得到阐述
Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression,

196
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,710
要么就是 能从所谓偶然的公理陈述中 找到答案
or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements,

197
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,150
也有可能是终极循环
or it's ultimately circular,

198
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
也就是说 因为我要搬出去 所以我要搬出去
i.e.I'm moving out because I'm moving out.

199
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,710
我还是不懂
I'm still confused.

200
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,070
莱纳德我已经说得够明白的了
Leonard,I don't see how I could have made it any simpler.

201
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,170
嘿 伙计们 还好吗?(蹩脚法语)
Hey,qu'est que s'up?

202
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,270
我们刚去看了塑化人体标本展
We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers.

203
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,500
那些个没皮的小妞儿 真是辣哟!
And some of those skinless chicks were Hot!

204
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,320
抱歉 我得去收拾了
If you'll excuse me,I'm going to pack.

205
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,380
他对我单纯的恋尸癖 反应还真大
That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.

206
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,800
霍华德 不关你事 他说他要搬出去
It's not you,Howard. He says he's moving out.

207
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,690
你对他干了啥?
What did you do?

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,320
你改了电视机的对比度和亮度?
Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?

209
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,920
没啊
No.

210
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,650
你在他面前扒了创可贴?
Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him?

211
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,630
没
No.

212
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,150
你买了三无番茄酱? 忘了洗水池?
Did you buy generic ketchup,forget to rinse the sink,

213
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,130
还是隔着厕所门同他讲话?
talk to him through the bathroom door?

214
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,250
调了恒温器? 煮菜放了芫荽叶? "t"那音总是忘了发?
Adjust the thermostat,cook with cilantro,pronounce the "t" in often?

215
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,750
没有
No.

216
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,590
你是不是拿火车开玩笑了?
Did you make fun of trains?

217
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,820
没有 我啥都没干 他疯了
No,I didn't do anything. He's just gone insane.

218
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,880
也是 这天迟早会来的
Well,we all knew this day was coming.

219
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,180
你动作还真快
Well,that was fast.

220
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,280
这是我早准备好的避难行囊
It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag.

221
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,420
国土安全部推荐的
It's recommended by the Department of Homeland Security.

222
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,810
还有莎拉·康纳 ("终结者"女主人公)
And Sarah Connor.

223
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,260
你打算住哪儿?
Where are you going to live?

224
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,150
在我找到寓所之前 我先在朋友家挤挤
Until I find a permanent place,I will stay with friends.

225
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,420
回见
Bye.

226
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,640
呃... 你不能住我那儿
Well... you can't stay with me.

227
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,540
我的公寓小得可怜
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

228
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,910
广纳宾客不正是"向人致敬"的一部分吗?
Excuse me,but isn't hosting guests an aspect of "manushya yajna,"

229
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,000
"向人致敬"不是印度五大宗教戒规之一吗?
one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

230
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,000
我讨厌火车
I hate trains.

231
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,580
别开玩笑了 你可喜欢火车了
Don't be ridiculous,you love trains.

232
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,490
啊 没错 来吧
Yes,I do. Come on.

233
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,590
回见 莱纳德
See you later,Leonard.

234
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,780
还真管用
This could work.

235
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,760
这栋楼有年头了
This is a very old building.

236
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,900
造了六十年了 以前是手表厂
60 years. It used to be a watch factory.

237
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,660
怎么了?
What?

238
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,020
你不担心残留在发光表盘里的镭吗?
Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?

239
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,040
你干嘛要提!
Not until now!

240
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,630
我竟然没带盖格计数器 (用于测量放射性物质)
I can't believe I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

241
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,810
就在床头 我居然没拿
I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.

242
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,400
那么... 谢尔顿 要是你觉得住着不舒服
Well,if you're not comfortable staying here,Sheldon...

243
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,120
我开玩笑的 我带来了
I'm kidding,I packed it.

244
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,570
是个笑话
It was a joke.

245
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,520
我就是要破坏你的语境期待
I was subverting the conversational expectations.

246
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,500
那叫啥来着 "出其不意"
I believe they call that the,uh,ol' switcharoo.

247
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,930
好极了
Terrific.

248
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,780
那女的是艾维雅·瑞儿（印度当红影星）吗?
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

249
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,570
是的 她是个很棒的演员吧
Yes,isn't she an amazing actress?

250
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,180
我倒觉得她是可怜虫心中的玛杜瑞·迪克西特 (印度90年代知名影星 后结婚生子)
Actually,I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

251
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,430
你敢再说一遍!
How dare you!

252
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
艾维雅·瑞儿是我的女神
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

253
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,230
相比之下 玛杜瑞·迪克西特 就是得麻风病的妓女
By comparison,Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

254
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,930
对不起 我没想到会冒犯你
Sorry,I didn't mean to offend you.

255
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,190
显然你不了解印度电影
Obviously,you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.

256
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,570
谁啊?
Who is it?

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,110
脱衣舞娘来喽!
Stripper-Gram!

258
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,960
交给你了
Tag,you're It.

259
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,120
你就不能把他塞进牛皮纸袋里 烧了算了?
Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?

260
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,120
我从来没睡过气垫床
I've never slept on an air mattress before.

261
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,490
腰部都没东西撑着
No lumbar support whatsoever.

262
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,650
你大概是想睡公园的长椅上是吧
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench.

263
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,200
我认为 你没有办法把长椅弄到这儿来
I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.

264
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,870
要换一下吗?
Do you want to switch?

265
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,230
不用了 这样挺好
No,that's fine.

266
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
睡在充气城堡上可舒服呢
I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.

267
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,310
下床来 我和你换
Get out of bed. We're switching.

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,490
- 我没逼着你换 - 快下床!
- Now,only if you want to. - Just get in the bed!

269
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,760
这是怎么了?
What's going on?

270
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,330
你们两个臭小子 闹什么闹?
Are you boys roughhousing?

271
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,020
老妈 我们只是在聊天!
We're just talking,Ma!

272
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,570
要是你们再不给我安生点
If you don't settle down right now,

273
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,570
看我以后还让不让你去朋友家过夜!
I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers!

274
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,410
老天啊 老妈 我都27了!
For God's sake,Ma,I'm 27 years old!

275
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,890
明天又不上学!
And it's not even a school night!

276
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,240
舒服了吧?
Comfy now?

277
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,490
那张哈莉·贝瑞(好莱坞女星 曾出演猫女)的海报让我有点紧张
That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving.

278
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,140
别看就是了
So don't look at it.

279
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,240
她是我第四爱的猫女郎
She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.

280
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,070
不是吧
No kidding.

281
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,800
对 前三个是朱莉·纽曼 米切尔·菲佛尔 和伊尔特·基特
Yeah,Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt,and then her.

282
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,520
李·梅里韦瑟呢?
What about Lee Merriweather?

283
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,370
噢 我把她忘了
Oh,I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

284
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,200
好吧 终于搞定了
Well,I'm glad that's settled.

285
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,340
那哈莉·贝瑞只能排第五了
That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman.

286
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,380
朱莉·纽曼  米切尔·菲佛尔 伊尔特·基特  李·梅里韦瑟...
It's Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt,Lee Merriweather--

287
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,680
求求你了 睡觉吧
Please,I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

288
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,110
我在努力嘛 都在数猫女郎了
I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

289
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,000
她在X战警里演的变种人倒是不赖
She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies,though.

290
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,970
噢 我求求你了
Oh,for God's sake.

291
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,280
X战警里我最喜欢的不是她
She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

292
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,540
要排序的话应该是:金钢狼 雷射眼
In order that would be: Wolverine,Cyclops--

293
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,100
噢 等等 我忘了X教授
Oh,wait,I forgot Professor X.

294
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,470
X教授 金钢狼 雷射眼 冰人 然后是暴风女 天使 还有野兽
Professor X,Wolverine,Cyclops,Iceman,then Storm,Angel,the Beast--

295
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,510
不对 等等 还有蓝魔人
No,wait,Nightcrawler.

296
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,720
X教授 蓝魔人 金钢狼 雷射眼 冰人 暴风女 天使...
Professor X,Nightcrawler,Wolverine,Cyclops,Iceman,then Storm,Angel...

297
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,330
来了!
I'm coming!

298
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,120
是他 我的老-伙-计
There he is. There my old buddy bud bud.

299
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,470
他是怎么了?
What's with him?

300
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,980
Koothrappali把他扔给了我 他睡不着觉
Koothrappali dumped him on me,and he couldn't get to sleep,

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,800
所以我给他倒了杯温牛奶 里面放了一把我妈的安眠药
so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's Valium in it...

302
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,500
可他还是不肯住嘴 得了 还给你吧
but he still wouldn't shut up,so tag,you're It.

303
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,200
我回...来了
I'm ba-a-a-ack.

304
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,400
我还是不知道你为啥要走
I still don't know why you left.

305
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,690
不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

306
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,010
为什么?
Why not?

307
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,120
我答应过佩妮
I promised Penny.

308
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,700
你答应她什么了?
You promised Penny what?

309
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,970
我答应她保密啊
I wouldn't tell you the secret.

310
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,450
什么秘密? 快告诉我
What secret? Tell me the secret.

311
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,990
老妈在车里抽烟
Mom smokes in the car.

312
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,100
耶稣觉得没问题 不过不能告诉老爸
Jesus is okay with it but we can't tell Dad.

313
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,150
不是这个 另一个秘密
Not that secret. The other secret.

314
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160
- 我是蝙蝠侠 嘘! - 我靠! 谢尔顿!
- I'm Batman-- Shh! - Damn it! Sheldon!

315
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,470
你说 佩妮跟你说了个秘密 什么秘密?
You said Penny told you a secret. What's the secret?

316
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,500
好吧 我告诉你 不过你不能告诉莱纳德
Okay,I'll tell you,but you can't tell Leonard.

317
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,710
我保证
I promise.

318
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,480
佩妮说她是社区大学毕业 其实没这回事
Penny lied about graduating from community college

319
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,570
因为她怕自己不够聪明 配不上莱纳德
'cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.

320
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,300
不是我做错什么了? 是她的问题?
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?

321
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,600
我喝了杯牛奶 味道真好玩儿
I drank milk that tasted funny.

322
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,490
佩妮觉得我太聪明 这也太搞笑了
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous.

323
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,110
我明白
I know.

324
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,770
你的大部分工作 都不是原创的
Most of your work is extremely derivative.

325
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,700
别担心 这就不是秘密了
And don't worry,that's not a secret.

326
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,620
谁都知道
Everybody knows.

327
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,630
听着 我已经知道我们之间的问题了 我也有了解决方案
Listen,I know what's been bothering you about us,and I have the answer.

328
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,570
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

329
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,280
好的 首先 这不是谢尔顿的错
Okay,first,I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault.

330
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,250
他已经很努力地替你保密了
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

331
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,200
要不是霍华德给他灌了安眠药 他是不会自掘坟墓的
If Howard hadn't drugged him,he would've taken it to his grave.

332
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,250
他告诉你了?
He told you?

333
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,820
是的 不过这没关系
Yes,but it's okay.

334
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,870
既然我们都知道问题何在 要解决岂不是很容易
Now that we know what the problem is there's a simple solution.

335
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,270
帕萨迪纳城市学院?(托福分数线最低的学校之一)
Pasadena City College?

336
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,190
"给你知识 给你乐趣"
A place for fun,a place for knowledge.

337
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,750
看见没? 这男的在玩沙包球 那女的会成为律师助手
See,this man here is playing hackey-sack,and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

338
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,280
噢 我明白了
Oh,I get it.

339
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,500
莱纳德·霍夫施塔特博士没法和一个 没有名牌大学文凭的女孩子谈恋爱
Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.

340
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,130
嗯... 其实这也不是个名校
Well,it's really not that fancy.

341
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,800
只是城市学院而已
It's just a city college.

342
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,530
没错 不过要和你约会 总得有个学位什么的是吧?
Right,but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?

343
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,270
这对我而言一点都不重要
That doesn't matter to me at all.

344
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,950
所以如果我不聪明也没关系
So it's fine with you if I'm not smart.

345
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,840
绝对没关系
Absolutely.

346
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,910
好吧 这次我知道我错在哪儿了
Okay,this time,I know where I went wrong.

347
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,400
你能拿我怎么样啊?!
Bite me!
