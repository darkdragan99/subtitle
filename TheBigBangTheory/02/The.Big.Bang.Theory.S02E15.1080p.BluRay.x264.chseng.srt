1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,570
* I don't ever want to feel *

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,670
* Like I did that day *

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,540
* Take me to the place I love *

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,000
* Take me all the way *

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,400
* I don't ever want to feel *

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,940
* Like I did that day *

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,940
* Take me to the place I lo... *

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,040
伙计们  拜托
Fellas, please.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,300
佩妮  别这样
Penny, come on.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,040
我们刚润好嗓子
We were just finding our sound.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,670
确实
You found it.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,100
听起来就像被割草机碾过的猫叫
It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,870
我真的很忙
I'm really very busy.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,240
有没有办法延期
Is there any way that we can put this off

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,300
好让我有时间准备
until I have more time to prepare?

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,940
当然
Of course.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,540
但你知道我害怕
But, uh, you understand my trepidation.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
怎么回事
What's that about?

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,840
没头绪
Not a clue.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,040
不能推迟到春季吗
Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,600
或者明年夏天
Maybe next summer?

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,670
这个很容易推断
This should be fairly easy to deduce.

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,870
他用左耳听电话
He's holding the phone to his left ear.

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,770
耳朵受同侧脑半球控制  他在用理性
Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
而不是感性的大脑半球  表明
rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,500
他与来电方无私人感情
he has no personal relationship with the caller.

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,500
不  我没发现有这么久了
No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,870
当然  我看也没别的选择了 只好硬着头皮上了
Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,970
他提到的是他以前做过的事
He's referring to an activity he has done before.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,070
令人不爽  还得反复做
It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,370
这就说明是某种
This suggests some sort of

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,640
侵入性医学检查  很可能是结肠镜检查
invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,270
没别的选择吗
Aren't there any other options?

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,640
空间不大
There's not a lot of room.

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,900
会很不舒服的
It's gonna be uncomfortable.

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,070
没错  没错
Yes, yes.

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,240
绝对是结肠镜检查
I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,300
好的  拜
Okay, bye.

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,100
我母亲要来了
My mother's coming to visit.

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,070
怎么样  你说对了
How about that, you were right.

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第15集

42
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,190
电梯故障了
It's out of order.

43
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,500
知道  我看到提示了
Yes, I can read the sign.

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,140
我在思考其含义
I'm just pondering the implications.

45
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,580
含义就是电梯坏了
I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,580
再说一次  我看到提示了
Again, I can read the sign.

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,910
但提示和带子上都积了一层灰
But the sign and the tape are coated with a layer of dust,

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,540
表明电梯不能用
which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional

49
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,080
有好长时间了
for a significant amount of time.

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,110
这就说明要么这楼的 24到36户人家  我假设的
Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume,

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,480
基于邮箱的个数
24 to 36 residents of this building,

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,080
和典型的城市人口密度得出的
based on the number of mailboxes

53
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,740
都特别懒散
and given typical urban population density

54
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,140
要么都同时产生功能性错觉
or a shared delusion of functionality.

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,980
你一定是莱纳德的母亲
You must be Leonard's mother.

56
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,380
我不确定我一定是  但没错
Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,780
我是佩妮  他的邻居
Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbor.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,480
贝芙莉·霍夫斯塔德博士
Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

59
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,180
很高兴认识你
Oh, nice to meet you.

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,340
你喜欢握手  有趣
Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.

61
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,480
跟我来吧
Uh, why don't you come with me.

62
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,240
-我带你去他公寓  -好的
I'll walk you to the apartment. Oh, all right.

63
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,410
路上可以寒暄寒暄吗
Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,740
当然  我想可以
Yeah, sure, I guess.

65
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,240
好的  你先说
All right, you start.

66
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,080
好的
Okay.

67
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,410
我总是很好奇
You know, I've always been curious.

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
莱纳德小时候什么样子
What was Leonard like when he was little?

69
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,340
我猜你是说年幼时
Oh, I think you mean young.

70
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,710
他一直很小[个子矮小]
He's always been little.

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,710
好的
Right, okay.

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,140
他年幼时什么样子
What was he like when he was young?

73
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,140
你得说得更具体些
You'll have to be more specific.

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
好的  大约5  6岁时
Um, okay, like, five or six.

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
5岁
Five.

76
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,110
在那个年纪  他正陷于
Oh, well, at that age, he was well enmeshed

77
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,080
被弗洛伊德称之为
in what Freud would call the phallic stage

78
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,880
性心理发展的阴茎期
of psychosexual development.

79
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,040
当然是过气的理论  但这孩子的确
An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend

80
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,080
醒着的大部分时间都紧紧地抓着"小弟弟"
most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
莱纳德提过你以前是精神病医生
Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.

82
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,440
是我的学位之一
Well, that is one of my degrees.

83
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,480
我的主修是神经系统学
My primary field is neuroscience.

84
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,510
我是个演员
Well, I'm an actress.

85
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,840
为什么
Why?

86
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,410
什么为什么
What do you mean why?

87
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,980
有研究表明很多从事
Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,840
演艺事业的人都受外界认同的煎熬
the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,810
我不知道那是什么意思
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,410
就是说只有别人看重你时 你才看重自己
Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you,

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,280
一般是童年情感需要得不到满足的结果
which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.

92
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,840
我有个很棒的童年
Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.

93
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,910
和我说说
Tell me about it.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,240
我知道我爸爸想要个男孩
I know my dad wanted a boy.

95
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,480
我就拼命让自己变成运动能手
I-I just, I tried being good at sports,

96
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,980
但我讨厌脏兮兮的
but I hated getting dirty!

97
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,040
之后  我猜  你进入青春期
And then, I'm assuming, you entered adolescence.

98
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,580
在我戴上少女乳罩前  他一直称我为强击手
He called me Slugger until I got my first training bra.

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,610
之后就不再和我一起打球
And then he just stopped playing catch with me.

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,980
我也不再是强击手了
I wasn't Slugger anymore.

101
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,080
你母亲来了
Your mother's here!

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,780
如果你想和那女孩性交
If you want to have intercourse with that girl,

103
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,710
查一下她父亲用哪种古龙水就行
find out what kind of cologne her fathore.

104
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,410
妈妈  很高兴见到您
Good to see you, Mother.

105
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,610
妈妈  您的茶沏好了
Here's your tea, Mother.

106
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,940
-乌龙茶  -是的
- Oolong? - Yes.

107
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,380
-散装的  不是茶包  -是的
- Loose, not bagged? - Yes.

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,780
-泡了三分钟  -是的
- Steeped three minutes? - Yes.

109
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,210
-百分之二的牛奶  -是的
- Two-percent milk? - Yes.

110
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,640
-分别加热  -是的
- Warmed separately? - Yes.

111
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,940
-一勺糖  -是的
- One teaspoon sugar? - Yes.

112
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,940
-粗糖  -是的
- Raw sugar? - Yes.

113
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,880
已经凉了
It's cold.

114
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,810
我重头再来
I'll start again.

115
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,980
我也觉得他有问题
I have the same problem with him.

116
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,610
我的理论是他不够专注
My theory is that his lack of focus

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,910
因为性欲过剩
stems from an over-developed sex drive.

118
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,080
我真不知道他是从哪遗传的
Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that.

119
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,180
在我和他父亲圆满的婚姻之余
Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage,

120
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,580
我们只为了生育下一代 而进行性行为
his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,380
这种安排太有效率了
That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,780
我们也这么认为
Yes, we think so.

123
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,210
我们都因此发表了论文
We've both done papers on it.

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,780
我的论文是从神经系统科学的角度写的
Mine from the neuroscientific point of view

125
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,910
他父亲是从人类学的角度
and his from an anthropological.

126
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,110
当然  只有我的论文值得一读
Mine, of course, was the onlyne worth reading.

127
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,610
必然的
Of course.

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,940
我很有兴趣拜读您的性生活
I would very much like to read about your sex life.

129
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,610
我放在网上了  你也可以
Well, it's all online or you can order it

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,710
从普林斯顿大学出版社订购
from the Princeton University Press.

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,780
母亲  请喝茶
Here's your tea, Mother.

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,480
你们在聊什么呢
So, what are you guys talking about?

133
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,110
你父母性行为的频率
The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.

134
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,040
一流
Swell.

135
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,540
如果你三生有幸  她可能
If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you

136
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,010
会给你看演讲的幻灯片
the PowerPoint presentation.

137
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,810
不好意思  存在我另一台笔记本里
I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.

138
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,140
那么  母亲
So, Mother...

139
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,640
有什么新鲜事么
what's new?

140
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,210
你要说得具体点
You'll have to be more specific.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,510
好吧
All right.

142
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,140
您有什么新鲜事么
Uh, what's new with you?

143
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,840
我目前 出现了一些奇妙的更年期症状
Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.

144
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,380
能谈谈不这么私人的吗
Maybe something less personal.

145
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,680
你叔叔弗洛德死了
Your Uncle Floyd died.

146
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,280
天啊
Oh, my God.

147
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,310
发生什么事了
What happened?

148
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,780
他的心跳停止了
His heart stopped beating.

149
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,040
我得去排尿了
I have to urinate.

150
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,940
真是个超赞的女人
What a remarkable woman.

151
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,010
我也觉得你们会很投缘
Yeah, I-I thought you guys might hit it off.

152
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,110
我真嫉妒你的童年生活
I envy you your childhood.

153
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,540
真不想告诉你  我童年唯一的美好回忆
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories

154
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,510
都是和我叔叔弗洛德在一起的
I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

155
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,110
你记错了吧
You're clearly misremembering.

156
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,210
你母亲聪明绝顶
Your mother is brilliant,

157
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,310
具有高超的分析力和洞察力
analytical, insightful.

158
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,010
我打赌就算你不肯吃汤菜
And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because

159
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,180
她也不会用圣经打你
you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,440
谢尔顿  你对你母亲的评价有失偏颇
Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit.

161
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,310
她是个有爱心的人
She's warm, she's loving,

162
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,180
她不会在你脑袋上贴上电极
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head

163
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
当你学着上厕所时测量你的脑电波
to measure your brain waves while potty training.

164
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,610
你很幸运
You were lucky.

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
我小的时候  如果想做脑电图扫描
When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,

166
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,980
我不得不自己贴电极
I had to attach my own electrodes.

167
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,710
霍夫斯塔德博士
So, Dr. Hofstadter,

168
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,140
莱纳德很少谈及
Leonard rarely talks about

169
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,040
他成就颇高的姐姐和弟弟
his incredibly successful brother and sister.

170
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,710
拜托  霍华德  别提这个了
Please, don't go there, Howard.

171
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,280
我了解到
I understand that,

172
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,680
不像莱纳德  他们 都是各自领域的权威人物
unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.

173
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,780
你个烂人
Boy, you suck.

174
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
莱纳德的弟弟迈克尔
Well, Leonard's younger brother, Michael,

175
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,610
是哈佛的法学终身教授
is a tenured law professor at Harvard,

176
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,880
他的姐姐刚刚成功地
and his sister just successfully grew

177
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,940
在一只青春期的长臂猿体内植入人类胰脏
a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.

178
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,380
她很快就能治愈糖尿病了
So, she's close to curing diabetes?

179
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
在一只十几岁的长臂猿体内植入胰脏还有别的原因么
Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

180
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,610
你一定很为他们骄傲吧
Wow, you must be very proud.

181
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,610
为什么
Why?

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,140
又不是我的成就
They're not my accomplishments.

183
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,380
我得去排尿了
I have to urinate.

184
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,710
你为什么这么做
Why are you doing this?

185
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,880
你知道游戏规则
You know the rules.

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,610
你带母亲来上班  就等着受罪吧
You brought your mom to work-- you must suffer.

187
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,380
莱纳德  我不知道
Leonard, I had no idea

188
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,880
你兄妹的成就都比你高这么多
your siblings were so much more successful than you.

189
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,510
你就像是霍夫斯塔德家族里的怪物查查比[星战里的马脸怪物]
Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.

190
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,340
我觉得[模仿查查比的牙买加口音] 你看起来好悲哀
Oh, meesa think yousa lookin' so so sad.

191
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,340
我的朋友不该嘲笑我
You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize

192
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,240
应该懂得我有多难  尽力帮我
that this is difficult and try to help me through it.

193
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,780
我觉得嘲笑你更有趣
Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.

194
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,810
下一次  看你还带不带妈妈来上班
Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work.

195
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,840
如何
Okee-day?

196
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,340
很快嘛
That was fast.

197
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,010
中间的坑被人占了
Oh, the middle stall was occupied.

198
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,540
我得一会再去
I'll have to try again later.

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,880
非常能理解
That's totally understandable.

200
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,910
排空膀胱  就好像搞房地产
In bladder voiding, as in real estate,

201
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,710
地点最重要
it's location, location, location.

202
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,110
说到哪了
So, where were we?

203
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,280
霍华德还和老妈住在一起   而拉杰不喝醉 就不会和女人说话
Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk.

204
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,940
说吧
Go.

205
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,410
很吸引人
That's fascinating.

206
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,340
选择性缄默症非常稀有
Selective mutism is quite rare.

207
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,840
另一方面  一个成年犹太男性
On the other hand, an adult Jewish male

208
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,340
和母亲同住已经普遍到
living with his mother is so common

209
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,440
近似于社会学的陈词滥调了
it borders on sociological cliché.

210
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,240
只是暂时的  我有付房租
It's just temporary; I pay rent.

211
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,880
他现在的房间就是以前放婴儿床的
He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.

212
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,580
无论是选择性缄默症
You know, both selective mutism

213
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
还是无法离开母亲独自生活
and an inability to separate from one's mother

214
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,340
都可能是源于对女性的病理性恐惧
can stem from a pathological fear of women.

215
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,910
这或许可以解释为何
It might explain why

216
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,610
你们俩建立一段同性恋代替性婚姻关系
the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage

217
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,440
来满足自己对亲密关系的饥渴
to satisfy your need for intimacy.

218
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,540
你说什么
Say what?

219
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,480
那不是等于我说的嘛
That's basically what I just said.

220
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,940
你带你"老公"一起工作
You brought your husband to work.

221
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,410
你知道游戏规则
You know the rules.

222
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,110
我觉得你们现在看起来也很悲哀  对吧
Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.

223
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,140
莱纳德  已经1点了
Leonard, it's 1:00.

224
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,380
1点不是要带我参观你的实验室吗
Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00?

225
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,740
别急  妈妈
There's no hurry, Mother.

226
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,480
再说一点他们之间的"地下恋情"
Tell them more about their secret love for each other.

227
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,280
但已经1点了
But it's 1:00.

228
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,640
你应该在1点带我去参观你的实验室
You were going to show me your laboratory at 1:00.

229
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,740
她的理由无懈可击
Her reasoning is unassailable.

230
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,780
已经1点了
It is 1:00.

231
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,410
好吧  咱们走
Fine. Let's go.

232
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,180
你肯定会觉得我的工作很有趣
I think you'll find my work pretty interesting.

233
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,340
我正在尝试复制意大利人从碘化钠晶体里
I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal

234
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,110
找到的暗物质信号
found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.

235
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,940
没有原创性研究
So, no original research?

236
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,480
没有
No.

237
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,840
那我去看还有什么意义
Well, what's the point of my seeing it?

238
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,710
我直接看意大利人的报导不就行了
I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.

239
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,040
强烈声明
Just for the record,

240
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,180
我们没有什么同性恋代替性关系
we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.

241
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,910
你刚怎么不跟她说
Well, then why didn't you say that to her?

242
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,220
为什么这老是我的责任
Why is it always my responsibility?

243
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,160
并非老是你的责任
It's not always your responsibility.

244
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,260
我保证  这和你上周在漫画书店干的事情没两样
I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.

245
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,820
难以置信你会提起这件事
I can't believe you're bringing that up.

246
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,720
才不是我提的  是你才对
I didn't bring it up. You did.

247
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,990
我们以后再说
We'll talk about this later.

248
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,760
你老这么糊弄我  从来没这么做过
You always say that, but we never do.

249
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,420
你们居然去漫画书店不带上我
You went to the comic book store without me.

250
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,020
你有酒吗
You got alcohol?

251
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,350
-你老妈还没走  -没错
Your mom still here? Yep.

252
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,020
进来吧
Come on in.

253
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,980
等等  她不会来这儿找你吧
Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?

254
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,150
别担心  她拖了谢尔顿去医院做脑扫描
Relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.

255
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,150
天啊  怎么了
Oh, my God. What happened?

256
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,980
没什么  老妈喜欢观察大脑
Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains

257
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,920
谢尔顿则想做脑扫描
and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.

258
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,420
一个愿打  一个愿挨
Geez, what a fun couple.

259
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,180
她只在这儿呆了一天半
She's only been here a day and a half

260
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,020
我已经开始认真考虑把酒精中毒
and I'm seriously considering alcoholism

261
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
作为我下半生的事业
as a new career path.

262
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,280
我昨天只和她聊了5分钟
Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday

263
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,550
就一直处于半醉状态
and I've been half bombed ever since.

264
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,520
你不能让她进驻你的大脑
You can't let her get into your head.

265
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,120
我的大脑  那你的呢
My head, what about yours?

266
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,280
已经太迟了
It's too late for me.

267
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,720
我的大脑就是她的避暑山庄
My head is her summer house.

268
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,480
可她并没有错
She was right, you know.

269
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,550
外界对我的认同都写在脸上了
The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.

270
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,050
已经被她洗脑了  你好  老妈
Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.

271
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,480
你知道我整个早上去哪了吗
I mean, do you know where I was all morning?

272
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,250
和50个金发美女抢试镜
Auditioning with 50 other blondes

273
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,850
为了一个愚蠢的抗抑郁药广告
for some stupid antidepressant commercial.

274
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,450
为了什么
And for what?

275
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,620
就为了最终得到我爸的认可
So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?

276
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
你抢到那个角色了吗
Did you get the part?

277
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,450
没有  他们说我太活泼了
No, they said I was too perky.

278
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,120
你想谈谈没有亲情的生活
You want to talk about not getting love from a parent.

279
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,980
你知道我的小时候
You know what I used to do when I was little

280
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,550
想获得人体接触做了什么吗
to have some sensation of human contact?

281
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,080
知道  你死抓着"小弟弟"不放
Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go.

282
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,280
你老妈告诉我的
Your mother told me.

283
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,550
不出所料
Of course she did.

284
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,220
但我想说的不是这个
Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say.

285
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,780
我10岁时 造了一个"拥抱机"
When I was ten years old, i built a hugging machine.

286
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,950
"拥抱机"
A hugging machine?

287
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,520
对  我找了个裁缝用的假人
Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin,

288
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,320
在里面塞一条电热毯
I stuffed it with an electric blanket

289
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,280
就能有温度  还装了两只无线电控制的手臂
so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms

290
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,420
能抱我  拍我的背
that would hug me and pat my back.

291
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,450
好悲哀
Oh, that is so sad.

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,550
-你知道最悲哀的是什么吗  -什么
You know what the saddest part was? What?

293
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,450
我爸爸常把它借过去
My father used to borrow it.

294
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,680
你的扫描资料会对我的研究非常有帮助
Your scan data will be very helpful to my research.

295
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,480
你有一颗非比寻常的大脑
You have a remarkable brain.

296
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,250
必须的
I know.

297
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,180
虽然我不喜欢我的右额叶
Although I've always hated

298
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,620
在X光片上的效果
how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.

299
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
男人抱怨最多的
Common complaint among men.

300
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,750
总嫌东西不够大
Nothing's ever big enough.

301
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,520
除非是个肿瘤
Except when they get a tumor.

302
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,620
你就不会听到这种抱怨了
Then you never hear the end of it.

303
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,780
希望改日能看看你的脑扫描
I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.

304
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,120
我会发个链接给你
Oh, I'll send you a link,

305
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,280
但就生理学来说  我的脑扫描相当无趣
but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.

306
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,280
真难以置信
Oh, I can't believe that.

307
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,720
你不愿接受经验实据
Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence

308
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,680
说明一种奉承之举
suggests an attempt at flattery.

309
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,350
我抱歉
My apologies.

310
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,180
我和你儿子住在一起太久了
I've been living with your son too long.

311
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,380
染了些坏习惯
Gotten into some bad habits.

312
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,180
可以理解
Understandable.

313
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,620
-能给你沏杯茶吗  -我怀疑你的能力
Can I make you a cup of tea? I doubt it,

314
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,620
不过有机会的人只有你了
but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.

315
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,520
和你呆在一起很舒服
I feel very comfortable around you.

316
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,980
我也有同感
I feel very comfortable around you, too.

317
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,380
令人吃惊
It's surprising

318
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,320
因为我通常跟任何人在一起都觉得
because I generally don't feel comfortable around,

319
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,720
不舒服
well, anyone.

320
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,650
我也是
Nor I.

321
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,850
像我们这么独特的两个人
What are the odds that two individuals

322
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,550
通过像你儿子这样的庸人
as unique as ourselves would be connected

323
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,250
而联系上的几率有多大
by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?

324
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,050
那是个修辞学观点呢
Is that a rhetorical point

325
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,180
还是你想算算
or would you like to do the math?

326
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,720
我想算一算
I'd like to do the math.

327
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,280
我也想
I'd like that, too.

328
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,030
好了  这次
Okay, now this time, Uh-huh.

329
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,700
你要舔掉我脖子的盐
you're gonna lick the salt...off my neck...

330
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,060
喝一杯
...do the shot...

331
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,000
再咬一口酸橙
...and then bite the lime.

332
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,430
抱歉  "舔"后的我都没听到
I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after "lick."

333
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,660
脖子  酒  酸橙
Neck, shot, lime.

334
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,360
好了  酒  酸橙
Okay, shot, lime.

335
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,960
对
Right.

336
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,730
酸橙在哪
Where's the lime?

337
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,300
我们一起吃
Oh, okay, we're sharing.

338
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,900
你觉得怎样
So, what do you think?

339
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,700
我被深深吸引了
I'm very tempted.

340
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,630
我只是不确定和我儿子的室友 是否合适
I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.

341
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,730
通常  我也会有同感
Normally, I'd feel the same way.

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,630
不过从我们身上的一切来看
But based on everything I've observed about us,

343
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,460
我无法自持地推测我们俩会很适合
I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.

344
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,030
确实  我也这样觉得
True. I've had a similar observation.

345
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,100
绝对是我和我老公都没做过的事
It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.

346
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,760
第一次尝试时我也很犹豫
I was hesitant the first time I tried it,

347
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,660
但我体验了一次未曾料到的
but I experienced an unanticipated

348
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,230
大量的安多芬[能产生快感]释放
and remarkable release of endorphins.

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,430
非常令人满意
It's quite satisfying.

350
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,130
我明白你的用意
I see what you're doing.

351
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,830
你很想对我做神经学研究
You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.

352
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,830
你完全看穿我了  不是吗
You see right through me, don't you?

353
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,400
只能在电脑断层扫描仪上
Only when you're in a CAT scanner.

354
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,730
梦想就要成真了
This is actually gonna happen.

355
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,060
亲爱的  嘘  嘘  嘘
Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

356
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,430
你嘘嘘  我开心  我想说
You shush, I'm happy. I want to talk about it.

357
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,160
你知道我妈会说什么吗
You know what my mother would say about this?

358
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,430
她会说  你爸爸不爱你
She would say because you were not loved by your father

359
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,930
我妈妈也不爱我
and I was not loved by my mother,

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,600
做爱是我们弥补儿时没有得到的 亲密关系的方法
that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.

361
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,600
你为什么现在要提这个
Why would you bring that up right now?

362
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,230
我不知道
I don't know.

363
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,330
前戏吗
Foreplay?

364
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,360
也就是说 你不是在和我做爱
So you're saying you're not having sex with me,

365
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,200
是和你妈做爱吗
you're having sex with your mother?

366
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,500
我想说"不是"
I'm gonna go with "no."

367
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,100
这是我听过最恶心的事了
That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.

368
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,060
得了吧  你不也是想和你爸爸做爱  我都没意见
Come on, you're trying to have sex with your father, and I'm okay with that.

369
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
滚出去
Get out!

370
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,430
她说"嘘"  我就应该闭嘴
She said shush. I should have shushed.

371
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,220
* Ooh, all night, all night *

372
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,820
* Oh, every night *

373
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,390
* Hold tight * * Hold tight *

374
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,920
* You hold tight * * Hold tight *

375
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,820
* Baby, hold tight *

376
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,390
* Anyway you want it, that's the way you need it *

377
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,420
好了  妈妈
All right, Mother.

378
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,020
一路顺风
Um, have a nice flight.

379
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,650
那又不是我能控制的
That's not really in my control, is it?

380
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,250
早上好
Oh, good morning.

381
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,550
早上好
Morning.

382
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,790
我刚想过来和你谈谈
Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.

383
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,820
没必要
You don't have to.

384
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,520
永远
Ever.

385
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,620
明白
Gotcha.

386
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,650
再见  妈妈
Good-bye, Mother.

387
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,020
再见  伦纳德
Good-bye, Leonard.

388
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,420
强击手   我们继续 上次没说完的话题吧
So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?

389
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,220
我妈妈完全可以说
I mean, my mom could've just said,

390
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,150
鲍勃  想开点  她只是个小姑娘
"Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on."

391
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,350
但她没有
But she didn't.

392
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,790
-一个字也没说  -很有趣
- Not one word. - Interesting.

393
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,220
你能不能乘飞机去新泽西做个脑部扫描
Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss

394
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,890
顺便谈谈你和父母的关系吗
your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?

395
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,250
-会有帮助吗  -对我有帮助
- Would it help? -Well, it would help me.
