1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,250
拉杰是宫保鸡丁
Let's see, Raj was the Kung Pao Chicken.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,910
我是饺子
I'm the dumplings.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,510
没错
Yes, you are.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,650
太恶心了  霍华德
Creepy, howard.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,450
恶心得可爱还是纯粹的恶心
Creepy good or creepy bad?

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,650
谁点的鲜虾加龙虾酱
Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,750
那是我的
That would be me.

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,810
朝这里看  你这个肮脏的小美味
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,480
我这话可不光是对着食物说哦
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,610
坐一边去
Sit over there.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,810
坐一边去
Sit over there.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,610
婴儿纸巾
Baby wipe?

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,850
你干嘛用
Why do you have...

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,810
-别问  -别  别问
No, don't ask! no, don't, don't!

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,010
我来告诉你为什么
I'll tell you why.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,980
我必须消毒我的手
I had to sanitize my hands

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,080
因为大学把 厕所里擦手的纸巾
Because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,280
换成了吹风机
With hot air blowers.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,480
我怎么感觉吹风机更卫生
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,050
别问啊
Really, don't.  why...?

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,010
吹风机可以说是细菌 和瘟疫的发源地
Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,450
老实说  用吹风机的话
Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

23
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,780
还不如让一只得了瘟疫的长臂猿打喷嚏打到我手干
If they just had a plague-infested gibbon

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,150
来得卫生呢
Sneeze my hands dry.

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,050
伙计们  我有一个天大的
Hey, guys, I just got the most amazing

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,610
好消息
News...

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,680
天呐  拉杰  你如果不喝醉的话
Gosh, raj, do you think you'll ever be able

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,750
是不是永远都不能在我面前说话
To talk in front of me without being drunk?

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,610
好吧  那我 就自己一个人去吃了
Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,080
佩妮  你不需要这样的
Penny, you don't have to do that.

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,050
没事  考虑到他不说话 他说的话  还有他
Oh, it's okay, between him not talking, him talking and him...

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,850
我最好还是离开吧
I'm better off alone.

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,650
再见  你这个可怜的怪人
Good-bye, you poor, strange little man.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,690
她太贴心了
She's so considerate.

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,280
你有什么大新闻
So what's your news?

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,710
还记得那个我定位的
Remember that little planetary object

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,780
比凯伯带天体更远的那颗行星吗
I spotted beyond the kuiper belt?

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,580
哦对  2008-NQ SUB-17
Oh, yeah, 2008-nq sub-17.

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,010
或者用我的叫法  宝莱坞星
Or as I call it, planet bollywood.

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,510
由于我的发现
Anyway, because of

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
《人物》杂志把我提名为
My discovery, people magazine is naming me

42
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,680
30岁以下的30大焦点人物之一了
One of their 30 under 30 to watch.

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,510
拉杰  祝贺你
Raj... congratulations.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,650
太棒了
That's incredible.

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,250
不好意思
Excuse me,

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,310
30岁以下的什么30大人物的什么焦点
30 what under 30  what to watch what?

47
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,410
30岁以下的30名值得关注的梦想家
30 visionaries under 30 years of age to watch

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,610
因为他们对自己领域的一些传统臆断提出了挑战
As they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,150
让我猜百万次我都不会想到是这样
If I had a million guesses, I never would have gotten that.

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,110
真是相当酷的  他们让我和一个
It's pretty cool. they've got me in

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,280
在研究印度尼西亚饥荒问题的人一起入选
With a guy who's doing something about hunger in indonesia,

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,150
还有一位精神治疗师  他在用海豚
And a psychotherapist who's using dolphins

53
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,550
来感化囚犯
To rehabilitate prisoners,

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,910
还有爱伦·佩基
And ellen page,

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,450
他是那部独立电影《朱诺》里的明星
Star of the charming independent film, juno.

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,980
我绝对想上她
Oh, I'd so do her.

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,980
你连海豚都想上
You'd do the dolphins.

58
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,810
你在用的那个我设计的望远摄像机的固定架
Do I get an honorable mention for designing

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,080
在采访中你会不会提到
The telescope camera mounting bracket you used?

60
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,650
不好意思
Sorry, it's not part

61
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,310
这和我所要叙述的温馨故事无关
Of my heartwarming and personal narrative

62
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,650
我是一个从新德里来的傻男孩
In which a humble boy from new delhi overcame

63
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,150
我克服了贫困和歧视
Poverty and prejudice

64
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,210
不远万里来到了美国寻找梦想
And journeyed to america to reach for the stars.

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,250
贫困吗  你老爸是个妇科医生
Poverty?  your father's a gynecologist.

66
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,980
他开的是宾利
He drives a bentley.

67
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,350
那是租的
It's a lease.

68
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,010
我有点搞不懂
I'm confused.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,750
是不是由什么行业审查委员会
Was there some sort of peer review committee

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,950
来决定选那些人
To determine which scientists would be included?

71
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,710
行业审查  这是《人物》杂志
Peer review?  it's people magazine.

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,850
人们选择了我
People picked me.

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,250
什么人
What people?

74
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,850
《人物》里的那些人啊
The people from people.

75
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,980
那这些到底是什么人
Yeah, but exactly who are these people?

76
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,250
他们有什么凭据吗
What are their credentials?

77
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,680
为什么他们有资格评选
How are they qualified?

78
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,350
偶然发现了一块在太阳系里
What makes accidentally  noticing a hunk of rock

79
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,180
慢悠悠地飘了几十亿年的
That's been traipsing around the solar system

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,450
大石头为什么就比其他
For billions of years more noteworthy

81
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,050
30岁以下科学家的成就 更加杰出呢
Than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under 30?

82
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,810
天呐  我想爱伦·佩基的朋友们 不会这样损她的
Boy, I'll bet ellen page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.

83
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,550
这下你感到自豪了吗
Are you proud of yourself?

84
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,880
总的来说  是的
In general, yes.

85
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,410
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第04集

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,610
哦  漏掉的中微子原来在这儿
Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,350
你就像一个不稳定的电荷一样躲躲藏藏的
You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge,

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,250
是吗  你这个亚原子魔鬼
Weren't you, you little sub-atomic dickens?

89
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,610
谢尔顿
Hey, sheldon.

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,810
看啊
Hey, look,

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,110
我找到了那个中微子
Look, I found  my missing neutrino.

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,810
太好了  我们可以把他从牛奶盒上拿下来了
Oh good, we can take it off the milk carton.

93
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,750
走吧  我们去和拉杰道歉
Come on, we're going to apologize to raj

94
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,850
请他去吃晚饭
And invite him out to dinner.

95
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,850
道什么歉
Apologize for what?

96
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,310
他昨天带了一个好消息来
He came over last night with some pretty good news

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,210
但我们都很不热情
And we weren't very supportive.

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,810
我感觉你像是要说什么
I sense you're trying  to tell me something.

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,880
你昨天相当欠扁
You were a colossal asshat.

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,250
没有吧
No, I beg to differ.

101
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,880
在我们3个人之间  我是最热情的一个
Of the three of us, I was by far  the most supportive.

102
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,710
是吗  来说说
Really? do tell.

103
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,850
如果拉杰的朋友们把门槛降低的话
How will raj ever reach true greatness

104
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,550
他怎么能找到科学的真谛呢
If his friends lower the bar for him?

105
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,380
我11岁的时候
When I was 11,

106
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,880
我妹妹给我爸买了一个
My sister bought our father

107
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,310
写着"世界上最好的爸爸"字样的咖啡杯
A "world's greatest dad" coffee mug

108
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,110
老实说  他一生就这么晃荡下去了
And, frankly, the man coasted until the day he died.

109
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,680
那么这么说吧
Okay, let's try it this way.

110
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,910
如果这个什么《人物》杂志 是拉杰能得到的最高成就呢
What if this people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve?

111
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,110
这我到没想到
I had not considered that.

112
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,650
走吧
Come on.

113
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,680
我总是忘了普通人是有极限的
I often forget other people have limitations.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,150
真是悲哀
It's so sad.

115
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,910
他能感到悲哀
He can feel sadness?

116
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,180
不太能
Not really.

117
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,310
我们管这个叫自以为是
It's what you and I would call condescension.

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,910
我们进去的时候 得让他觉得我们为他高兴
Now when we go in there, let's show raj that we're happy for him.

119
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,180
看是我不觉得啊
But I'm not.

120
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,910
那就装得高兴
Well, then fake it.

121
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,910
你看我
Look at me.

122
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,150
我可以完全不去想 如果没有我的电子望远镜
I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,610
他永远也不能发现 那块愚蠢的宇宙垃圾
He never would have found that stupid, little clump of cosmic schmutz.

124
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,280
我很牛吧
But I'm bigger than that.

125
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,380
好了
Fine.

126
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,450
那你让我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

127
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,350
笑
Smile.

128
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,580
太可怕了
Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

129
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,450
我们是去看库萨帕里 不是去干掉蝙蝠侠
We're here to see koothrappali, not kill batman.

130
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,910
笑不露齿
Try less teeth.

131
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,550
差不多了
Close enough. come on.

132
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,080
嗨  拉杰
Hey, raj.

133
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,480
怎么了
Hey, guys.   what's up?

134
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,480
我们今天晚上想请你吃饭
We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.

135
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,050
庆祝一下你的大器早成
To celebrate your "30 under 30" thing.

136
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,450
对吧  谢尔顿
Right, sheldon?

137
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,380
你们太好了
That's very nice of you.

138
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,410
我很乐意去
I would like that.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,080

144
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,710
沃罗威茨先生
Mr. wolowitz.

145
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,810
孩子们  我有个问题要问你们
Boys, I've got a question for you

146
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,050
这个房间里
Who in this room

147
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,550
谁发现了颗星星[恒星]
Discovered a star?

148
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,410
事实上  2009-NQ SUB-17只是颗行星
Actually, 2008-nq sub-17 is a planetary body.

149
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,380
我不是在说你  是说我呢
I'm not talking about you,  I'm talking about me.

150
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,480
你  我来自异国他乡的青年朋友
You, my exotic young friend,

151
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,610
就是我的明星
Are my star.

152
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
但他不是你发掘出来的
But you didn't discover him.

153
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,850
你以前都不会留意到他
You merely noticed he was here,

154
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,710
就跟他也没怎么留意过2008-NQ SUB-17
Much like he did with 2008-nq sub-17.

155
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,710
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

156
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,850
不好意思
Oh, sorry.

157
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,210
孩子  我们真该给你换个好点的办公室
Boy, we've got to get you into a better office.

158
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,350
能配得上你的名气
Something more suited to your status.

159
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,010
真的不用麻烦了
Really, you don't have to go to any trouble.

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,010
我把你安排到冯·哥图尔以前的办公室怎么样
How about if I put you in von gerlich's old office?

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,510
我更喜欢菲什宾的  更宽敞一点
I'd rather have fishbein's. it's bigger.

162
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,310
等等  自打菲什宾穿浴袍出现在办公室那天
Wait a minute, I called dibs on fishbein's office

163
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,780
我就申请他的办公室了
The day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.

164
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,350
能给他换办公室  就不能
He gets a new office, I can't even get

165
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,550
-在男厕所放点擦手巾  -谢尔顿
-Paper towels in the men's room? -sheldon.

166
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,250
该死  真难为我了
Damn, this is hard.

167
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,980
让我问问你们
Let me ask you something.

168
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,750
你们觉得咱们的工作为的是什么
What do you think the business of this place is?

169
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,710
科学
Science

170
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,380
-是钱  -告诉过你吧
-Money. -told you.

171
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,310
这孩子的照片上了《人物》周刊
And this boy's picture in people magazine

172
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,710
能给我们带来多少钱
Is gonna raise us a pile of money taller than...

173
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,280
堆起来比你高
Well, taller than you.

174
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,680
我有个硕士文凭的
I have a master's degree.

175
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,310
谁没有啊
Who doesn't?

176
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,680
库萨帕里博士  你有没有
Dr. koothrappali, have you ever had lunch

177
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,210
在院长的餐厅吃过午饭呢
In the president's dining room?

178
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,750
我都不知道还有专门给院长的餐厅
I didn't even know there was a president's dining room.

179
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,580
和食堂的食物种类一样  就是更新鲜一点
It's the same food as the cafeteria, only fresh.

180
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,750
走吧  小同志
Come on, little buddy.

181
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,850
好滴  老同志
Okay, big buddy.

182
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,050
大家晚上见
See you tonight, guys.

183
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,350
你不用笑了
You can stop smiling now.

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,250
用过美妙的午餐之后
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch,

185
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,350
他们就催我去《人物》周刊拍照
I was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot...

186
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,610
孩子们你们去过专业拍照的地方么
Have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?

187
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,650
没啊
Uh-uh.  no.

188
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,010
很神奇的哦
It's fantastic.

189
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,950
很明显 镜头对我很有爱  我也很上镜
Apparently, the camera loves me and i, it.

190
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,150
我站在星空的背景前面 拍照  我摆了个这样的姿势
They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.

191
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,850
他们要PS一个超新星进去
They're going to digitally add a supernova.

192
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,780
他们觉得这样能完美诠释 我辉煌的天赋
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.

193
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,310
没错  就像一个炽热的大火球
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas

194
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,680
分崩离析
That collapses upon itself.

195
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,080
抱歉
Excuse me.

196
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,010
是我的助理特雷弗打来的
Oh, it's my assistant, trevor.

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,650
我是库萨帕里
Go for koothrappali.

198
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,680
还给他配个助理
they gave him an assistant

199
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,710
我想要根笔 还得拿着剪线钳去银行
If I want a new pen, i have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

200
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,810
咱们已经尽到所有该尽的社会责任了吧
Have we at this point met our social obligations?

201
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
还没
Not yet.

202
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,610
好吧  先安排到我的日程里
Okay, just put it on  my calendar,

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,510
同时帮我想个我出席不了的理由
But start thinking of a reason why I can't go.

204
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,210
哦了么  我挂了
All righty? koothrappali out.

205
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680
上帝保佑那孩子
God bless that boy.

206
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,650
没有他我非忙死不可
I don't know what I'd do without him.

207
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,880
你今天下午才有的助理啊
You just got him this afternoon.

208
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,250
没错  但我觉得我是得有个仆人
Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.

209
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,880
仆人
A lackey?

210
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,610
不好意思  是不是法律不允许啊
Oh, I'm sorry. is that politically incorrect?

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,750
在印度  我们称其为贱民
In india, we just call them untouchables.

212
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,880
现在
Now?

213
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,050
快了
Almost.

214
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,610
说到贱民  我给你们带来了好消息
Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys.

215
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,410
这周六《人物》杂志要举行个招待会
People magazine is having a reception this saturday

216
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,450
我设法让你们也被邀请了
And I managed to get you invited.

217
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,780
切  谢了
Oh, gee, thanks.

218
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,250
不客气
Oh, you're welcome.

219
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,910
当然我没法让你们去贵宾席
Of course, I couldn't get you into the vip section

220
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,380
因为那是设给贵宾的
Because, you know, that's for vips

221
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,710
你们只是  普通人
And you guys are just, you know... p's.

222
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,710
在巴布亚新几内亚有一个部落
There's a tribe in papua new guinea

223
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,980
当一个猎人向其他部民
Where, when a hunter flaunts his success

224
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,350
炫耀他的成功时
To the rest of the village,

225
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,710
他们宰了他  并敲打他的皮做的鼓
They kill him and drive away evil spirits

226
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,380
以驱逐他邪恶的灵魂
With a drum made of his skin.

227
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,480
当然是迷信而无道理的
Superstitious nonsense, of course,

228
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,780
但某人可以明白他们的用意
But one can see their point.

229
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,850
给你  拉杰
Here you go, raj.

230
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,750
你或许想慢慢享用这杯
You might want to drink this one slowly.

231
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,050
那就周六晚上了  这么说定了
Okay. so, saturday night, can I count on my posse?

232
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,410
我很乐意去  拉杰  但我去不了
Gee, I'd love to, raj,  but I can't make it.

233
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,980
好的  莱纳德
Oh, okay. leonard?

234
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,250
不行  我要  不行
No, I could... no.

235
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,550
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

236
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,580
我能去  但我不想去
I can make it. but I won't.

237
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,450
你们在说什么
What are you guys talking about?

238
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,550
周六有场为我的杂志文章举行的招待会
There's a reception for my magazine article on saturday.

239
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,780
而你们这些家伙不准备去
And you guys aren't going?

240
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,210
真不敢相信
I can't believe you.

241
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,080
拉杰要庆祝他的惊人成就
Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment

242
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,410
而你们甚至都不去支持他
And you're not even going to be there to support him?

243
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,850
惊人成就应该是
A tremendous accomplishment would be

244
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,550
如果他发现一个行星体
If the planetary body he discovered

245
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,810
正急速撞向地球  他用意念摧毁了它
Were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind.

246
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,310
那太酷了
That would be cool.

247
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,250
我得去那个招待会
I'd go to that reception.

248
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,150
拜托  这很重大
Come on, this is huge.

249
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,750
拉杰上了《人物》杂志
Raj is gonna be in people magazine,

250
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,080
他甚至不用搞大斯皮尔斯姐妹中的一个的肚子
And he didn't even have to knock up one of the spears sisters.

251
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,180
你愿意和我一起去吗
Would you like to go with me?

252
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,280
我当然愿意
Of course I would.

253
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,310
我很荣幸
I would be honored.

254
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,850
真的  酷
Really? cool.

255
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,210
替你们脸红
Shame on you guys.

256
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,950
看看  我约到佩妮了
Look at that, I got a date with penny.

257
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,380
不敢相信那花了你一整年的时间
I can't believe it took you a whole year.

258
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,950
现在呢
Now?

259
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,010
就是现在
Now.

260
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,280
嘿  伙计
Hey, buddy,

261
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,580
我要上《人物》杂志了
I'm going to be in people magazine.

262
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,450
上封面的时候再打给我
Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

263
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,450
[查理·西恩 《好汉两个半》男主角 ]

264
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,740
看看你
look at you

265
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,590
我像正午的阳光般闪耀  不是吗
I know. I'm resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?

266
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,850
先说香槟 喝得有点早  不是吗
Uh, yeah. starting with the champagne a little early, aren't you?

267
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,880
豪华轿车里的  他们派了辆豪华轿车
It was in the limo. they sent a limo.

268
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,210
我坐的是豪华轿车  我真喜欢说"豪华轿车"
I have a limo. I just love saying "limo."

269
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,180
你做准备的时候喝点这个
Sip on this while you're getting ready.

270
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,350
我准备好了
Oh, I'm ready.

271
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,050
你就穿这个
That's what you're wearing?

272
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,780
对呀  怎么了  有什么不好吗
Um, yeah. why, what's wrong with it?

273
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,380
没什么  只是我本来期望的更
Nothing. I was just hoping for something a little more,

274
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,980
疯狂些
You know, ridonkulous.

275
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,610
是啊  今晚的疯狂就
Mm, yeah. well, this is all the donkulous

276
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,280
这个样子了
You're gonna get tonight.

277
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,310
好好  让我们摇摆吧
Okey-dokey,  let's roll.

278
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,950
好了  狂欢时刻开始
All right, it's time to raise the roof!

279
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,710
嘿  莱纳德
Hey, leonard.

280
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,880
-嘿  -哥们
Hey. dude.

281
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,050
你看起来很不错
You look very nice.

282
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,110
谢谢
Thank you.

283
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,050
走吧
Come on.

284
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,450
-晚安  莱纳德  -晚安
Good night, leonard. good night.

285
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,080
莱纳德  看到楼下我那辆豪华轿车了吗
Hey, leonard, do you see my limo downstairs?

286
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,450
看到了
Yeah.

287
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,910
比我爷爷小时候的房子还大
It's bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.

288
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,080
好极了
Terrific.

289
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,610
食物也更多
It has more food, too.

290
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,410
好了  走吧  走吧
All right, come on. come on.

291
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,410
嘿
Hey.

292
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,750
嘿  好消息
Hey, good news.

293
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,580
你不用再为佩妮闷闷不乐了
You don't have to sulk about penny anymore.

294
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,250
有成千上百个克罗地亚女人
Look, there are hundreds of croatian women

295
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,010
正等着你去找她们
Just waiting for you to contact them.

296
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,110
为了绿卡什么都行.com
Anything-for-a-greencard.com?

297
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,850
我可以借你我的用户名
I'll lend you my user name.

298
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,450
"富有的大鸡鸡"
It's "wealthy big penis."

299
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,650
开玩笑吧
You're joking.

300
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,280
你得让她们容易明白
You gotta make it easy for 'em.

301
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,850
她们刚开始学英语
They're just learning english.

302
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,280
算了
Pass.

303
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,780
你就在这儿郁闷着
So you're just gonna sit around here and mope

304
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,710
而佩妮在和快易买的阿普博士约会
While penny is out with dr. apu from the kwik-e mart?

305
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,850
那不是个约会  那是种族主义
It's not a date, and that's racist.

306
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,480
不可能是种族主义
It can't be racist.

307
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,680
他是《辛普森一家》中的可爱角色
He's a beloved character on the simpsons.

308
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,150
我们开饭吧  我好上床睡觉
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

309
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,510
运气好的话 今晚我就会死于睡眠呼吸暂停
With any luck, tonight will be the night my sleep apnea kills me.

310
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,010
你还记得
Did you remember to ask

311
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,180
－西兰花要切丁  不要切丝  -是的
For the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded? yes.

312
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,750
即使菜单上强调是"切丝"
Even though the menu description specifies "shredded"?

313
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,280
-是的  -黑米  不要白米饭
Yes. brown rice, not white?

314
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,010
-是的  -你去韩国杂货铺
Yes. did you stop at the korean grocery

315
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,650
-买了上等的芥末酱  -是的
And get the good hot mustard? yes.

316
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,230
你从市场上买了低盐酱油吗
Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?

317
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,710
-是的  -谢谢 -不用
-Yes.  -Thank you.-You are welcome

318
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,380
你怎么去了那么久
What took you so long?

319
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,480
就坐下吃吧
Just sit down and eat.

320
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,950
好的
Fine.

321
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,910
行了  是切丝的  你想要我怎么样
All right, it's shredded. what do you want me to do?

322
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,680
我想让你拿餐之前检查一下
I want you to check before you accept the order.

323
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,780
抱歉
Sorry.

324
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,180
你是不是担心库萨帕里
Were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali

325
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,710
会和佩妮上床  所以才分神的
Might have intercourse with penny tonight?

326
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,350
他不会和佩妮上床的
He's not going to have intercourse with penny.

327
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,480
那鸡肉的事就没有借口
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

328
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,980
库萨帕里的境况让我想起了
You know, this situation with koothrappali brings to mind

329
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,510
我小时候的一件事
A story from my childhood.

330
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,080
太好了  又是关于狭长地带的事
Oh, goody, more tales from the panhandle.

331
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,210
那是德克萨斯的西北部  我来自德克萨斯东部
That's northwest texas. I'm from east texas,

332
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,880
高尔夫之地  越南捕虾者的故乡
The gulf region, home to many vietnamese shrimpers.

333
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,550
捕虾者是你故事里的主角吗
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

334
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,180
不是
No.

335
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,550
不管怎样
Anyway,

336
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,050
我八岁时
When I was eight,

337
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,050
一辆蒙哥马利区的送货车从我们家小猫阿吉身上辗过
A montgomery ward delivery van ran over our family cat lucky.

338
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,150
阿吉吗
Lucky?

339
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,380
对  阿吉
Yes, lucky.

340
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,250
他不太会用反讽  不用管
He's irony-impaired. just move on.

341
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,610
好的  有一只叫阿吉的死猫  接着讲
Okay, dead cat named lucky. continue.

342
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,580
当其他人哀悼阿吉时  我想到的是它的提早离世
While others mourned lucky, I realized his untimely demise

343
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,010
给我提供了一个换掉他的机会
Provided me with the opportunity to replace him

344
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,010
找一个更符合我个人口味的宠物
With something more suited to my pet needs

345
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,250
一个忠实的伴侣
A faithful companion

346
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,880
这样我晚上睡觉时就能抱着它
That I could snuggle with at night,

347
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,780
而且还能阻止心灵捕手的杀害
Yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.

348
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,680
那你不想要小狗
So not a puppy?

349
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,610
当然  我不要步行的
Please, nothing so pedestrian.

350
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,480
我想要个狮身鹰首兽
I wanted a griffin.

351
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,150
狮身鹰首兽吗
A griffin?

352
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,080
对  一半是鹰  一半是狮子
Yes, half eagle, half lion.

353
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,250
还是一半是神话
And mythological.

354
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,410
毫不相关
Irrelevant.

355
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,180
我在研究DNA重组技术
I was studying recombinant dna technology,

356
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,980
我相信我能造出来一个
And I was confidant I could create one,

357
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,480
但我爸妈不愿意
But my parents were unwilling

358
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,150
找实验必须的老鹰的卵和狮子的精子
To secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

359
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,150
当然了  当我妹妹想要时 她能在游泳课上得到
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.

360
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
谢尔顿  不是我们不喜欢关于狮子精子的故事
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story,

361
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,350
只是  你到底想说什么
But... what's your point?

362
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,450
我想说的是如果库萨帕里得到了
My point is if koothrappali is moving on

363
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,050
不应该属于他的名誉而过上了新生活
To a new life of shallow undeserved fame,

364
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,780
也许是时候造一个更好的同伴了
Perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.

365
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,210
你还想培植一个新朋友
You want to breed a new friend?

366
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,080
是个选择  不过谁有那闲工夫
That's one option,  but who has the time?

367
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,810
不过想想这个  日本人
But consider this-- the japanese,

368
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,910
他们正在做一些关于
They're doing some wonderful work

369
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,210
人工智能的研究
With artificial intelligence.

370
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,380
现在  你把这项研究和来自迪斯尼
Now, you combine that with some animatronics

371
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,380
幻想者的那些电子动物们结合
From the imagineers over at disney,

372
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,150
咱们就能和通晓多国语言的
Next thing you know, we're playing halo

373
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,380
亚伯拉罕·林肯玩《光环》了[视频游戏]
With a multilingual abraham lincoln.

374
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,150
谢尔顿  别会错意了  不过你真是疯了
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but you're insane.

375
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,010
可能像你说的那样吧
That may well be,

376
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,850
不过事实是结识新人
But the fact is it wouldn't kill us

377
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,350
它也不会杀了我们
To meet some new people.

378
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,250
我正式声明  它可能会因结识新人而杀了我们
For the record, it could kill us to meet new people.

379
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,350
他们可能是杀人凶手  或者未知病原体的携带者
They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

380
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,250
而且我没疯  我妈带我做过检查了
And I'm not insane. my mother had me tested.

381
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,280
如果我们真有了个新朋友
If we do get a new friend,

382
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,110
他应该是一个我们信得过的人
He should be a guy you can trust.

383
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,080
他应该支持你
A guy who has your back.

384
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,680
而且他应该有很多钱
And he should have a lot of money

385
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,450
居住在海滩旁边的一所酷宅
And live in a cool place down by the beach

386
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,610
我们可以在那举办聚会
Where we could throw parties.

387
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,050
他应该像我们那样热爱科技
He should share our love of technology.

388
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,410
他还应该认识很多的女人
And he should know a lot of women.

389
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,210
那就是说  钱  女人  科技
Let's see, money, women, technology.

390
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,930
好的  同意 我们的新朋友会是钢铁侠
Okay, we're agreed. Our new friend is going to be iron man.

391
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
欢迎光临拉杰的泰姬陵
Welcome to the raj mahal.

392
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,030
很不错  晚安  拉杰
It's very nice. good night, raj.

393
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,230
-别走  等等  今晚尚未结束  -今晚结束了
-No, no, wait. the evening's not over. -yes, it is.

394
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,060
没有  放上罗·凯利的歌  再做些面部吸吮
No, it's time to put on some r. kelly and suck face.

395
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,400
哇  今晚结束了吗
Oh, wow, is the evening over?

396
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,930
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait!

397
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,930
这是我爸妈从印度打来的
That's my mommy and daddy calling from India.

398
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,560
我想让你见见他们
I want you to meet my parents.

399
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,160
等等  见见他们
Wait. meet them?

400
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,460
嗨  爸妈  很高兴见到你们
Hello, mommy, daddy. good to see you.

401
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,530
你们怎么样  我没喝醉
How are you? I'm not drunk.

402
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,630
你为什么这么说
Why would you say that?

403
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,200
就是想找找话题
Just making conversation.

404
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,000
爸妈  我想让你们见见我的新马子  佩妮
Mommy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, penny.

405
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,100
我不是你的马子  也没有什么骡子
I'm not your squeeze. there is no squeezing.

406
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,730
我看不到她  把她放到摄像头里
I can't see her. center her in the frame.

407
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,160
好了  可爱吧
Here you go. cute, huh?

408
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,360
她不是印度人
She's not indian.

409
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,000
不是又怎么了  儿子只是在播种种子而已
So she's not indian. the boy is just sowing some wild oats.

410
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,400
不对  不对
No, no, no,

411
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,060
没有什么播种  马子还有面部吸吮
There's no sowing, no squeezing and no sucking face.

412
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,030
他要是把她肚子搞大了呢
What if he gets her pregnant?

413
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,560
你想让这个小可爱 当你孙子孙女们的妈妈吗
Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren?

414
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,560
你有什么权利 挑选谁和我生孩子
What right do you have to pick with whom I can have children with?

415
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,900
好吧  拉杰  我知道你身在美国
Look, rajesh, I understand you're in america.

416
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,700
你想试试"当地的佳肴"
You want to try the "local cuisine."

417
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,700
相信我  你可不想顿顿吃
Trust me. you don't want it for a steady diet.

418
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,100
现在听我说
Now you listen to me.

419
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,500
我不是小孩了
I am no longer a child

420
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,330
你们不应该这么跟我说话
And I will not be spoken to like one.

421
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,560
先失陪一下  我要去吐了
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go throw up.

422
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,760
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

423
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,260
不知道
I don't know.

424
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,060
可能是当地佳肴的缘故
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

425
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,960
好吧  很高兴见到你们
Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

426
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,630
我这就把你们放到这边
I'm just gonna set you on down over here.

427
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,400
我要走了  合十礼
And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

428
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,960
还有就是  有我做儿媳  你们应该感到幸运
And fyi, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.

429
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,960
她很传统  我喜欢
She is fusty. I like that.

430
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,780
拉杰  你在干什么
Raj, what are you doing?

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,730
不行  纸条不行
No, no notes.

432
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,030
有什么要说的  当我面说
If you have something to say to me, say it.

433
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,490
对不起
Sorry.

434
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,260
没关系的  小可怜
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
