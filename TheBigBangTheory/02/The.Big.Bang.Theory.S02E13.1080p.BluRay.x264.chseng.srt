1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,860
先生们 我告诉你们哟
Gentlemen,I put it to you:

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,890
最难吃西米布丁也好过其他口味优质布丁
the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavor.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,360
首先 明眼人都知道这话错的 因为最好的布丁是巧克力口味
First off,that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,420
其次 西米的有机结构使布丁 黏糊糊摇晃晃 有潜在致命危险
Secondly,the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,790
是从植物里提取...
It is extracted from the plant...

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,990
嘿 我在考虑留点胡子
Hey,I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,210
不是吧?
No kidding?

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,220
傅满洲那样的? 八字胡 又尖又长?
Fu Manchu,a handlebar,pencil?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,660
- 是从植物中提取 - 还没想好呢
- It's extracted from the plant. - I'm not sure yet.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,200
乔治·克鲁尼现在也留胡子呢
You know,George Clooney has one now.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,990
真的? 我看到过他在拉夫斯超市买龙舌兰酒
Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,130
你以为他们会有仆人跑腿买酒吗?
You'd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,640
好啦 太残忍了
All right,this is cruel.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,430
我们还是让他说完 不然人家要爆头了
We'd better let him finish before his head explodes.

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,550
好吧 谢尔顿 为啥西...
All right,Sheldon,why is tap...

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,090
西米由食用木薯根茎提取而成
Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta!

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,640
由于富含高浓度的氰化物
Due to a high concentration of cyanide,

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,240
其本身有毒性 如加工不当即食用会致命
it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly!

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,880
现在爽了吧?
Feel better now?

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,310
同时可可豆也是巴西的 从中能提取巧克力 做最好的布丁
It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the coa bean,from which we get chocolate,the best pudding.

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,210
求你们别再耍我了!
And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore!

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,360
嘿 霍夫施塔特
Hey,Hofstadter.

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,130
嘿 Kripke
Hey,Kripke.

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,780
听说你最新的反质子衰变实验了
Heard about your latest anti-proton decay experiment.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,120
收集两万数据 却没啥有用的结果
20,000 data runs and no statistically significant results.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,720
灰常了得
Very impressive.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,610
蠢货一个
What a jerk.

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,120
别气馁 莱纳德 没用的结果也是结果
Don't feel bad,Leonard. Negative results are still results.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,570
- 就算两万又算啥 - 行啦!
- Even 20,000 of them. - All right!

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,020
求你们别在给我打气了
Please don't cheer me up anymore.

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,340
别呀 不要让他打击到你 Kripke哪根葱
Come on. Don't let him get to you. It's Kripke.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,330
对呀 大蠢蛋一个
Yeah,he's a ginormous knob.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,670
所以他孤单用餐 而不能坐到这酷酷的桌子来
That's why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table.

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,620
说得对呀
For shizzle.

35
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,920
确实啊 Kripke确实缺乏 咱固有的那种基本社交技巧
It's true Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted.

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,130
但他还操控着新的开放科学网格计算机
But he also controls the new open science grid computer

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,220
而我需要它来模拟宇宙早期的结构形态
that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,770
看你有没有那命用上吧
Well,good luck getting time on it.

39
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,210
他可只让他的朋友使用
The only people he lets use it are his friends.

40
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,480
那 解决办法很简单嘛
Well,then,the solution is simple.

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,320
我去和他做朋友
I shall befriend him.

42
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,780
Kripke!
Kripke!

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,460
啥事?
Yeah?

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,860
你觉得我们交个朋友如何?
What would you say to the idea of you and I becoming friends?

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,970
我觉得木有啥兴趣哟
I would say I have no interest in becoming your friend.

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,190
当真?
Really?

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,410
你个里里外外不受欢迎的家伙 目光还真是相当短浅呀
That seems rather shortsighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable.

48
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,060
不如重新考虑下吧?
Why don't you take some time to reconsider?

49
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,390
行呀 我去想想
Yeah,I'll do that.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,100
看来咱这开局不错啊
Well,I think we're off to a terrific start.

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,220
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第13集

52
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,610
好了
There you go.

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,010
现在所有沃尔伍兹发来的邮件 都会直接进入垃圾箱
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,010
多谢 其实骚扰邮件倒没啥 他穿浴衣的度假照比较雷人
Thanks. I mean,the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.

55
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,150
是呀 我也收到了 那可不是浴衣 是晒痕
Yeah,I got the same one,and that's not a bathing suit. It's a tan line.

56
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,870
你好 我是谢尔顿·库珀
Hello,this is Sheldon Cooper.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,420
这是给贝瑞·克里帕奇的留言
I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,020
贝瑞 很高兴在食堂与你邂逅
Barry,it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria.

59
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,400
我注意到你买了推荐沙拉
I saw that you purchased the chef's salad.

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,860
显然 你不知道推荐沙拉是 食堂的杂碎肉骗人把戏
Apparently,you did not know that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat.

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,240
不过呢 我希望你用餐愉快
Nevertheless,I hope you enjoyed it.

62
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,230
我在追踪待定友谊的发展状况 期待你来电给它定位哟
I'm following up on our pending friendship and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status.

63
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,920
我是谢尔顿·库珀
Sheldon Cooper.

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,210
胆小发明家又咋了?
What's up with Ichabod?

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,660
他在交友呢
Uh,he's trying to make a new friend.

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
真的? 不错嘛
Oh,really? Well,good for him.

67
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,270
除非他像杰佩托做出皮诺曹 不然没戏的
Well,unless he makes one out of wood like Geppetto,I don't think it's gonna happen.

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,350
那你们咋成为朋友的?
How did you guys become friends?

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,420
大学公告板上的一张传单
There was a flyer on the bulletin board at the university:

70
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,120
"招募室友 吹口哨的勿扰"
"Roommate wanted.Whistlers need not apply."

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,120
你就搬进去了?
And you moved in anyway?

72
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,970
我以为他说着玩的
I assumed he was joking.

73
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,960
你绝对想不到有多少量子物理学家 都有反复无常的一面
You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.

74
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,500
霍华德和拉吉呢? 我是说他咋和他们好上的?
What about Howard and Raj? I mean,how did he become friends with them?

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,580
不知道 碳原子是如何构成苯环的?
I don't know. How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?

76
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,450
价电子亲近
Proximity and valence electrons.

77
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,440
是呀 你这样说也是哈
Well,sure,when you put it that way.

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,890
但相处的也不错是吧
But it all worked out,right?

79
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,330
差不多吧 尽管我很怀念口哨
I suppose. I do miss whistling,though.

80
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,780
不是吧?
Oh,come on. Really?

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,290
警告一次
First warning.

82
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,910
佩妮 佩妮 佩妮
Penny? Penny? Penny?

83
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,330
给你的
This is for you.

84
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,170
你好 谢尔顿
Hello,Sheldon.

85
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,470
这是啥?
What is this?

86
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,900
我设计的调查表
It's a questionnaire I devised.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,940
我和一位同事交友遇到点困难
I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work

88
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,170
所以我想做些小调查 更好的了解 为什么我目前的朋友们喜欢我
so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,740
嗯 这个问题值得考虑
Yes,well,that is a good question.

90
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,510
但你确定这是最好的办法了?
But is this really the best way to figure it out?

91
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,870
问得好 社会学家很大程度是忽悠
I agree. The social sciences are largely hokum.

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,410
但又不能插一个电极到你的大脑 探测你对我友谊问题的反应
But short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship,

93
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,180
就这方法还凑合了
this is the best I can do.

94
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,790
好 "问题1: 按吸引力程度给 谢尔顿·库珀以下各方面排序
Okay,"Question one: "Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper "in order of appeal:"

95
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,940
聪明 洁癖 有趣 Java程序编写?"
Intelligence;ruthless attention to hygiene;playfulness; JAVA applet writing"?

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,250
也许头一个问题答案过分明显
I know,I may have started out with a fairly obvious one;

97
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,940
谁不知道我最吸引人的特质之一 有趣
an aspect of my most appealing trait: playfulness.

98
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,020
你直接把它排到1号吧
Why don't you just go ahead and rank that number one?

99
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,770
恐怕剩下的我不能指导你了
I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest.

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
用不了三个小时就可以完成
It should take you no more than three hours.

101
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,550
等下 这玩意儿有多少个问题呀?
Well,wait. How many questions are on this thing?

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,980
区区211个
Only 211.

103
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,870
别担心 为了照顾你 这份高中毕业就能读懂
Don't worry. In deference to you,I kept them all at a high school graduate reading level.

104
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,730
还得谢你 哥们儿
Thanks,pal.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,420
客气啥...姐们儿
You got it... buddy.

106
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
谢尔顿 亲爱的 你有没有考虑过 通过让人开心来交友啊?
Sheldon,honey,did you ever consider making friends by being,I don't know,pleasant?

107
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,990
那当然是一个发人深思的假设
Well,that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis.

108
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,790
我看你论文写这题目好了
May I suggest it as the topic for your essay?

109
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,350
你的调查问卷 十分让人失望呀
Your questionnaire,very disappointing.

110
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,180
我逢题必答呀 谢尔顿
I answered every question,Sheldon.

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,040
你选择题很有规律嘛
You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern:

112
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,890
A B B A C A B B A C
A- B-A-C.A- B-A-C.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,090
你发现了哈
Oh,you picked up on that,huh?

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,320
我怎么会发现不了?
How could I not?

115
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,730
行行好 超过200个问题
Come on. There's over 200 questions.

116
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
看有些问题吧
And look at some of these things.

117
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,150
"谢尔顿之于友谊如同太空梭之于什么?"
"Sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank?"

118
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,680
这里有些适合的答案呀
There are a number of acceptable answers.

119
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
例如 C近地运输机
For example,Near-Earth transport."

120
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,420
但绝对不是B鳄梨种植工
But certainly not Avocado rancher."

121
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,750
你在论文里还说等到赛昂人接管地球 我在交友方面会更有运气
And your essay suggesting that I'd have better luck making friends if I wait till the Cylons take over?

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,820
请别
Please.

123
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,870
等等 那篇我可是认真写的
Now hold on. I put some real work into that.

124
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,470
是呀 可比沃尔伍兹好多了
Yes,well,it's better than what Wolowitz did.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,980
他画了一个大阴囊的发情浣熊
He drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum.

126
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,510
还真有点可爱哟
It's kinda cute.

127
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,610
只要不看它那玩意儿
Until you get to the scrotum.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,310
我怎么会有希望建立新的友情关系?
What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that

129
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,680
现存的朋友们都舍不得用 他们漫长生命的少许小时来帮助我
my current friends apparently could not take a few hours out of their lives to help me?

130
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,560
谢尔顿 我没打算为大蛋蛋浣熊说话
Sheldon,I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.

131
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,940
我看不出你能做到
Well,I don't see how you could.

132
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,860
我想说的是 或许你不能把 这些当作纯粹智力习题来对待
What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.

133
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,590
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

134
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,180
还记得你怎么在网上学游泳吗?
Well,remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the Internet?

135
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,920
我是学过游泳
Ididlearn how to swim.

136
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,110
在地板上学的
On the floor.

137
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,910
技巧是相通的
The skills are transferable.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,570
我只是不想到水里去
I just have no interest in going in the water.

139
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,160
那你为啥要学游泳呀?
Then why learn how to swim?

140
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,820
冰盖在融化呀 莱纳德
The ice caps are melting,Leonard.

141
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,860
未来 游泳是不可避免的
In the future,swimming isn't going to be optional.

142
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,790
但你给了我灵感
But you do bring up an interesting point.

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,740
我用不着做新的研究
I don't have to break new ground here.

144
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,160
肯定很多研究结果是现存的
I'm sure much of the research already exists.

145
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,960
不 不 我想说的是 如果你想学如何交友
No,no,my point is,if you want to learn how to make friends,

146
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,140
到咖啡店或者博物馆去
then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum.

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,290
认识些人 和他们交流
Meet people. Talk to them.

148
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,330
了解下人家的生活
Take an interest intheirlives.

149
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,050
疯了呗
That's insane on the face of it.

150
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,130
- 走吧 - 我们去哪儿?
- Come on. - Where are we going?

151
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,410
你载我去卖场
You're driving me to the mall.

152
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,090
我要去买本现存交友领域的理论大全
I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend-making.

153
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,050
你干嘛不直接躺地上 游过去呢?
Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?

154
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,260
<如何面对至爱的离去>
Coping with the Death of a Loved One.

155
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,670
- 节哀顺变 - 感谢你
- My condolences. - Thank you.

156
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,680
- 家人还是朋友? - 家人
- Family or friend? - Family.

157
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,250
太遗憾了
Too bad.

158
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,870
如果是朋友 我刚好可以填补空缺
If it had been a friend,I'm available to fill the void.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,810
没关系 她满身卫生球味道
It's just as well. She smelled like mothballs.

160
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,290
好吧 要是你在这嗅人玩 我去买点热脆饼
Okay,if you're gonna start sniffing people,I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

161
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,980
劳驾
Excuse me.

162
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,080
有交友的书吗?
Do you have any books about making friends?

163
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,420
嗯 有 但都是写给小孩子的
Um,yeah,but they're all for little kids.

164
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,640
我想技巧可以推断 道理相通嘛
I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,150
可能吧 就在木火车那边
I guess. They're right over there by the wooden train set.

166
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,460
我爱火车
I love trains.

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,240
你当然喜欢了
I bet you do.

168
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,220
哎 呀 还真粘
Oh,my,that's awfully sticky.

169
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,880
好了 我来瞧瞧哈...
All right,let's see...

170

<兔子波尼有两个爸爸了>
Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now.

171
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,950
估计是同志兔子的故事
That's probably about homosexual rabbits.

172
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,950
<沙鼠杰瑞和恶霸在公车上>
Gerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus.

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,490
读过了 没啥用
Read it. Not helpful.

174
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,960
哦 有了
Oh,here we go.

175
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,650
<动物园的新成员鹦鹉斯图>
Stu the Cockatoo Is New at the Zoo.

"Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne,Indiana

177
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,560
居住于印第安纳州 韦恩堡
"with her husband and best friend,Mark,and their cockatoo Stu."

178
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,840
没有点交友专家的样子 你说是吧?
Hardly makes her an expert in making friends,wouldn't you agree?

179
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,370
我不喜欢鸟类 它们多吓人
I don't like birds. They scare me.

180
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,510
我也是诶
Me,too.

181
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,900
很多人都意识不到
Most people don't see it.

182
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,040
你读啥呢?
What are you reading?

183
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,300
<好奇的乔治>
Curious George.

184
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,390
哦 猴子我可喜欢
Oh,I do like monkeys.

185
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,190
好奇乔治就是猴子
Curious George is a monkey.

186
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,650
算是人格化的 但没错
Somewhat anthropomorphized,but yes.

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,340
或许 啥时候咱俩去看个猴子呗 你觉得好不?
Say,maybe sometime you and I could go see monkeys together. Would you like that?

188
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,820
好哇
Okay.

189
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,080
谢尔顿 你干嘛呢?
Sheldon,what are you doing?

190
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,210
我和这小女孩交朋友呢 你叫什么名字?
I'm making friends with this little girl. What's your name?

191
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,230
瑞贝卡
Rebecca.

192
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,470
嗨 瑞贝卡 我是你的新朋友谢尔顿
Hi,Rebecca. I'm your new friend,Sheldon.

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,920
不 别搞了 走吧
No,you're not. Let's go.

194
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,030
- 我俩聊得正投机呢 - 别抬头 上面有摄像头
- We were really hitting it off. - Don't look up. There's cameras.

195
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,460
我想知道哈 在"你有多了解谢尔顿"那项
********the "How well do you know Sheldon" section,

196
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,540
他最喜欢的氨基酸 你们填的啥?
what did you put for his favorite amino acid?

197
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,550
- 赖氨酸 - 赖氨酸
- Lysine. - Lysine.

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,340
完了 我本来写了赖氨酸 又改了
Damn it,I had lysine and changed it.

199
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,400
太好了 时间刚刚好
Oh,good,you're just in time.

200
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,320
我想我解开了交友解题步骤
I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.

201
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,800
谢尔顿 交友哪有解题步骤啊
Sheldon,there is no algorithm for making friends.

202
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,550
得了 听他讲完 要是真有啥发现
Well,hear him out. If he's really onto something,

203
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,060
咱就在动漫大会上弄个展台 赚他一笔
we could open a booth at Comic-Con.Make a fortune.

204
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,960
是这样 我最初和Kripke搭话就跟
See,my initial approach to Kripke had the same deficiencies

205
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,750
鹦鹉斯图刚到公园时一样有着缺陷
as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo when he was new at the zoo.

206
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,580
鹦鹉斯图?
Stu the Cockatoo?

207
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,330
没错 他是动物园新成员
Yes. He's new at the zoo.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,650
超赞的书
It's a terrific book.

209
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,260
我摘录它的精华制作了流程图来指导我
I've distilled its essence into a simple flow chart that will guide me through the process.

210
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,150
有没有考虑过出门时把他装进大木箱里?
Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you're out of the apartment?

211
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,640
你好 Kripke? 我是谢尔顿·库珀
Hello,Kripke? Sheldon Cooper here.

212
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,660
我想到哈 你没回我的电话
It occurred to me that you hadn't returned any of my calls

213
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,410
是因为我没为发展友情提出实际建议
because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship.

214
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,810
或许咱俩该一起吃个饭
Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together.

215
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,180
了解
I see.

216
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,340
那有没有时间喝个热饮?
Well,then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage?

217
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,640
最受欢迎的有茶 咖啡 可可
Popular choices include tea,coffee,cocoa.

218
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,490
了解了解 别 先别挂
I see. No,no,no,wait. Don't hang up yet.

219
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,520
那娱乐娱乐怎么样呢?
What about a recreational activity?

220
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,970
我们肯定有共同爱好
I bet we share some common interests.

221
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,600
说说你有啥兴趣爱好
Tell me an interest of yours.

222
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,170
真的呀? 骑真马?
Really? On actual horses?

223
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,710
再说个兴趣爱好
Tell me another interest of yours.

224
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,050
抱歉 不到逼不得已 我才不下水游泳
I'm sorry. I have no desire to get in the water till I absolutely have to.

225
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,330
再说个兴趣爱好
Tell me another interest of yours.

226
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,280
哦这问题要无限循环下去了
Uh-oh,he's stuck in an infinite loop.

227
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,470
我来搞定
I can fix it.

228
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,670
有意思 但口技不是个人娱乐项目吗?
Interesting,but isn't ventriloquism by definition a solo activity?

229
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,870
再说个兴趣爱好
Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.

230
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,560
你喜不喜欢猴子呀?
Is there any chance you like monkeys?

231
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,600
你咋回事嘛? 人人都喜欢猴子
What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys.

232
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,390
别挂 Kripke
Hang on,Kripke.

233
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,510
没办法时 选择不太讨厌的项目
A loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity.

234
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,570
霍华德 聪明啊
Howard,that's brilliant.

235
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,140
你居然想到了
I'm surprised you saw that.

236
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,790
天呀 谢尔顿咋交不到朋友呢?
Gee,why can't Sheldon make friends?

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,460
好了 Kripke 你刚说那兴趣爱好 是我不太讨厌的
All right,Kripke,that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable,

238
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,170
我提议咱一起去玩
and I would like to propose that we do that together.

239
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,490
明天
Tomorrow.

240
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,090
是的 我付钱 好的 拜拜
Yes,I'll pay. All right,good-bye.

241
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,430
好啦 该学学攀岩了
All right. Time to learn rock climbing.

242
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,840
要知道 我超喜欢口技哟
You know,I am a fan of ventriloquism.

243
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,570
要不你我还有你的小假人去喝个热饮
Maybe you,me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage.

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,880
你喝时他表演
He could talk while you drink.

245
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,450
不鸟 我想攀岩
Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

246
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,370
这家伙比在电脑上看起来大啊
This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop.

247
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,600
想看原始人怎么用骨头当武器呢
One expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapons.

248
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,390
你恐高啊 库珀?
You afraid of heights,Cooper?

249
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,430
哪能啊 恐高完全不合理
Hardly. A fear of heights is illogical.

250
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,320
然而害怕掉下来 才是有发展眼光的说法
A fear of falling,on the other hand,is prudent and evolutionary.

251
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,020
你说要巩固我们的友情 我最少要爬多高呀?
What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?

252
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,890
好啦 这开生日会呢 小盆友都爬
Come on,they have birthday parties here. Little kids climb this.

253
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,290
小原始人吧
Little kid hominids perhaps.

254
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,430
你工作就干这点事啊? 父母一定很骄傲哈
So is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.

255
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,650
- 来啊 库珀 - 来了 Kripke
- Let's go,Cooper. - I'm coming,Kripke.

256
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,630
好的 绳子貌似很结实
Okay,the harness seems to be secure.

257
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,340
刚才有点不能自制 但网上说那是正常情况
A small amount of incontinence just now,but the Web site said that's to be expected.

258
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,400
也不咋难嘛 像是垂直游泳
this isn't so bad. It's like vertical swimming.

259
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,760
嘿 瞧瞧 库珀 都爬到一半了
Hey,look at you,Cooper. You're almost halfway to the top.

260
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,090
是吗?
I am?

261
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,490
我错了 我恐高
I was wrong. It is a fear of heights.

262
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,730
你还好吗 库珀?
You all right there,Cooper?

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,980
不太好
Not really.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,920
感觉像是反正切曲线接近渐近线了
I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approached an asymptote.

265
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,290
你是说你卡住了?
Are you saying you're stuck?

266
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
反正切曲线接近渐近线 哪个字你不明白啊?
What part of inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?

267
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,220
我都明白 我又不是白痴 接着爬啦
I understood all of it. I'm not a moron. Just keep going.

268
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,130
我想我做不到
Yeah,I don't think I can.

269
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,700
那就爬下去
Well,then climb back down.

270
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,000
不行 更没可能了
No,that doesn't seem any more likely.

271
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,900
你打算咋办 库珀?
What's your plan,Cooper?

272
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,790
不能算是啥打算 我想我要晕菜了
Well,it's not exactly a plan,but I think I'm going to pass out.

273
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,740
抱歉 咱再做一次行吗?
I'm sorry,can we please just do it one more time?

274
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,900
好的 一二 一二三
Okay. One,two,one,two,three,and...

275
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,560
小事一件 但真是怀念啊
It's a little thing,but you really do miss it.

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,700
大家好
Hello,everyone.

277
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,290
我带新朋友贝瑞·克里帕奇回家吃饭了
I brought my new friend Barry Kripke home for dinner.

278
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,880
你们也好啊
Hello to you,too.

279
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,000
攀岩怎样?
How was rock climbing?

280
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,790
他晕过去了
He passed out.

281
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,570
跟个意大利腊肠一样吊在那
Just hung there like a big salami.

282
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,760
那 那 那是我的座
Tha-tha-that's where I sit.

283
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,260
你还有固定座位呢? 咋这么怪捏
Ooh,you have a special spot? What kind of wacko are you?

284
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,350
看你有多少时间
How much time you got?

285
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,770
来点中餐?
You want some Chinese food?

286
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,400
太好了 有牙线没?
Terrific. Got any dental floss?

287
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,090
在洗手间
In the bathroom.

288
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,430
马上回来
Be right back.

289
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,650
吃中餐前要先把牙里的印度菜弄出来
I got to floss the Indian food out of my teeth if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

290
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,870
谢尔顿 还好吗?
Sheldon,are you okay?

291
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,430
哦 好呀 全晕过去了 但值了
Oh,yes,I pass out all the time,but it was worth it.

292
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,790
我和Kripke的友情有了质的进展 但这也产生了一个尴尬的问题
I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke,which brings me to an awkward moment.

293
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,660
咋了?
What's that?

294
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,950
维持五个朋友的友情太困难了 所以...
Maintaing five friendships promises to be a Herculean task,so...

295
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,630
我要开除你们其中一个
I'm going to have to let one of you go.

296
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,740
我 我 选我吧
Me,me,let it be me.

297
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,340
莱纳德 你是我的室友 我的出行工具
Leonard,you are my roommate,my source of transportation,

298
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,350
床单烘干后你会为我叠好
and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer.

299
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,110
你安全了
You are safe.

300
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,940
- 能吹口哨不? - 别犯傻
- Can I whistle? - Don't be silly.

301
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,940
霍华德 你没有博士学位 你的古龙水刺激感官
Howard,you do not have a PhD; your cologne is an assault on the senses;

302
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,580
犹太重大节日期间 你不能参与电子游戏
and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.

303
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,720
我有罪啊 我淘汰了
Guilty as charged. I'm out.

304
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,760
不 你也安全
No. You too are safe.

305
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,420
哦 不是吧 我该怎么做呀?
Oh,come on. What do I have to do?

306
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,160
好了 我知道怎么个意思了
Okay,you know what? I see where this is going.

307
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,750
我不属于你们中的一员 我也不是科学家 直接告诉我...
I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist,so just tell me...

308
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,820
佩妮 佩妮 佩妮 你说的都对 但请听我说完
Penny,Penny,Penny,everything you're saying is true,but please allow me to continue.

309
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,360
拉吉 你被淘汰了
Raj,you're out.

310
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,320
问的好
That's a good question.

311
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,310
你的确为这个同类的小团体 注入了异域的文化
While you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group,

312
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,630
但你问卷的回答太闹心了
your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

313
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,110
你怎么会觉得我最喜欢的氨基酸是谷氨酰胺?
How could you for a moment think that my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

314
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,050
他写了赖氨酸 又改了
He had lysine,but changed it.

315
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,650
早干啥了 拉吉
Shoulda,woulda,coulda,Raj.

316
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,840
我喜欢在吃东西前打牙线 以便牙缝迎接新的食物
I like to floss before I eat so my gum pockets are open for new food.

317
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,360
你好啊!
Hello!

318
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,790
我以前怎会没注意到你?
How did I walk past you?

319
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,070
- 我是贝瑞 - 佩妮
- I'm Barry. - Penny.

320
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,640
呃 这名字不咋性感嘛
Eh,that's not a very hot name.

321
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,490
我要叫你罗姗
I'm going to call you Roxanne.

322
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,090
哦 饺子
Ooh,pot stickers.

323
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,710
突然前 我变得如此优质了哈?
Suddenly,I'm looking pretty good,huh?

324
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,170
Kripke 我在想你能不能借我用用 开放科学网格计算机呢?
So,Kripke,I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer?

325
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,100
- 不行 - 不行? 我们是朋友啊
- No. - No? But we're friends.

326
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,770
抱歉 不行 我的盆友
I'm sorry. No,my friend.

327
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,350
搞不懂了
I'm confused.

328
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,270
我以为你会让朋友用那机器的
I was given to understand that you allow your friends time on the machine.

329
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,710
不 不是那么回事 有正式安排的 我做不了主
No,that's wrong. There's an official schedule. I have no control over it.

330
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,210
看来整个尝试都是徒劳了
Well,this entire endeavor seems to have been an exercise in futility.

331
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,010
拉吉 你可以回来了
Raj,you're back in.

332
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,720
他喜欢猴子
He likes monkeys.

333
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,240
我得表扬他的坚持精神
*****im credit for sticking with it.

334
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,700
我看他是没那细胞
I didn't think he had it in him.

335
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,880
这次差点就到顶了啊
And he almost made it to the top this time.
