1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,790
史上最逊的文艺复兴集会
Worst. renaissance. fair. ever.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,520
别再墨迹了  谢尔顿
Please let it go, sheldon.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,690
还原历史的准确度也太低了
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,620
举个例子  客栈的女服务生上给我们一大壶蜂蜜酒
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,890
她的服装明显是日耳曼式的
Her costume was obviously germanic.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,920
但在1487年  巴伐利亚纯酿法令
But in 1487, the bavarian purity laws,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,520
或者叫"纯度法令"
Or "reinheitsgebot,"

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,950
严格限制了蜂蜜酒的可用性
Severely limited the availability of mead.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,050
最多他们只能用一点调味酒
At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,550
你真是太吹毛求疵了
You're nitpicking.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,050
是吗
Oh, really?

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,050
那我就再来挑一下疵  那个酒壶
Well here is another nit for you.The flagons

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,390
在以前绝对不会是用聚丙烯做的
Would not have been made of polypropylene.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,190
文艺复兴集会的重点不是历史准确度有多高
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,950
重点在于把那些在金考公司上班的丰满女孩们带来
They're about taking chubby girls who work at kinko's

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,890
给她们系上紧身胸衣
And lacing them up in corsets so tight

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,590
好让她们的波波跳出来和我们说  您好
Their bosom jumps out and says, "howdy."

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,320
十五世纪的胸部不会说  您好
Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,820
如果要说的话  也只能是  万岁
If anything, they would've said, "huzzah."

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,150
我才不管波波说什么  谢尔顿
I don't care what the bosoms say, sheldon.

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,890
只要它们在对我说话就好
I just want to be part of the conversation.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,790
伙计们
Hi, guys.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,050
好像你们刚才去文艺复兴集会了
Looks like you've been to the renaissance fair...

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,220
我希望是
I'm hoping.

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,750
文艺复兴集会吗
Renaissance fair?

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,990
更像是中世纪兼启蒙时代
More of a medieval, slash, age of enlightenment,

27
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,250
兼找借口穿遮阴布的集会
Slash, any-excuse- to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,620
好吧  随便你
Okay, fine, whatever.

29
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,990
伙计们  这是我的朋友  埃里克
You guys, this is my friend eric.

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,120
很高兴见到你
So, yeah, good to see you.

31
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,850
我也是
It's good to see you, too.

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,690
我们应该走了
We should probably go.

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,520
大家再见
Bye, guys.

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,890
我很喜欢你的帽子
I like your hat.

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,450
谢谢  是我妈做的
Thanks, my mom made it.

36
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,190
佩妮有了新男友  非常尴尬
Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.

37
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,050
没什么尴尬的
It wasn't awkward.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,150
不过也不算好玩
It wasn't fun.

39
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,750
再说了  有什么关系
Besides, what's the big deal?

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,650
我们约会过  然后不约会了  事情已经过去了
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,850
你说过去了的意思
By moving on,

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,690
是不是指当她和另外一个男人约会的时候
Do you mean she's going out with other men

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,820
你却整个下午都在
And you spent the afternoon

44
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,350
和沃罗威茨做十五世纪的肥皂
Making 15th-century soap with wolowitz?

45
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,220
那不是十五世纪的肥皂
That was not 15th century soap.

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,220
我的天呐  那些人必须得学学
My god, those people need to learn

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,420
不是在一样东西名字前加上"老"字[仿古字]
You can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want

48
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,520
就能冒充古老的东西了
And expect to get away with it.

49
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,690
我们快点进去好吗
Can we please just go in?

50
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,850
我的锁子甲被夹在内裤里了
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
你穿了现代的内裤
You're wearing modern underwear?

52
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,520
相对来说是现代的
Relatively modern.

53
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,890
干嘛  你穿了什么
Why, what are you wearing?

54
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,890
我严格遵守历史  准确无误地
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments

55
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,850
穿着亚麻布内衣
Out of linen.

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,350
你去买亚麻布了
You went out and bought linen?

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,520
别傻了  我只是借用了你的枕头套
Don't be silly-- I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

58
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,250
借用
Borrowed?

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,420
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第02集

60
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,850
你们知道吗  我很高兴佩妮有了新发展
You know what,I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,170
这样我就可以自由前进了
It gives me the freedom to move on myself.

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,500
你的意思是你一直以来都在踌躇
Are you saying that you've been holding back?

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,570
当然
Of course.

64
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,030
出于对她的尊敬
Out of respect.

65
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,200
那么在佩妮之前的十年你怎么解释
So, how do you explain the ten years before penny?

66
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,870
那时候你在尊敬谁
Who were you respecting then?

67
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,100
我和很多女人约会过啊
Well, I've dated plenty of women.

68
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,970
有乔伊斯·金
There was joyce kim...

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,700
莱斯利·温克尔
Leslie winkle...

70
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,600
通知一下牛津词典的编者
Notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary.

71
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,530
"许多"这个词被重新定义为"二个"
The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,570
去年那个在动漫展里的那个女孩呢
What about that girl last year at comic-con?

73
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,600
不算
Doesn't count.

74
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,800
为什么
Why not?

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,430
在动漫展服装扮演里发生的事情
What happens in costume at comic-con

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,530
只是动漫展的事情
Stays at comic-con.

77
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,630
你这样说
You're only saying that

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,130
只是因为你的那件事
Because of what happened to you.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
什么事
What happened to you?

80
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,770
没什么
Nothing happened to me.

81
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,600
这不是你的错  拉吉
It wasn't your fault, raj.

82
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,830
他只是打扮成了绿色的猎户座女奴
He was dressed as a green orion slave girl.

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,670
怎么开始说我了
How did we get on me?!

84
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,000
我们不是在嘲笑莱纳德吗
We were mocking leonard for not moving on.

85
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,600
老兄  你完全是在原地踏步啊
Dude, you have totally not moved on.

86
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,970
不是这样的
Yes, I have.

87
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,770
现在我只需要
It's just a matter of actually making

88
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,730
-和别人出去约会而已  -谁
A date with someone. like who?

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,530
乔伊斯·金
Well... there's joyce kim.

90
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
但她已经叛逃回朝鲜了
But she defected back to north korea,

91
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,330
所以在地理上来说有点小困难
So that's a little geographically undesirable.

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,670
那莱斯利·温克尔呢
What about leslie winkle?

93
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,930
-不行  -为什么
Oh, no. why?

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,870
她的研究方法论漏洞百出
Her research methodology is sloppy,

95
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,600
她在说圈量子引力论的时候毫无道理的傲慢自大
She's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity,

96
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,030
而且更糟的是  她对我很坏
And to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,900
我觉得她很火辣
I think she's smoking hot.

98
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,070
同意
I'd hit that.

99
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,330
你觉得胶体悬浮系统上的
You'd hit particulate soil

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,730
微粒污垢也很火辣
In a colloidal suspension.

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,330
泥巴
Mud.

102
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,130
我喜欢莱斯利  但她对约会并不感兴趣
Look, I like leslie, but she's not interested

103
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,930
她只想使用男人的工具来缓解自己的压力
In dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,970
那又如何  做她的工具好了
Yeah, so? be a tool.

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,270
你也可以给自己缓解一下"压力"
Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."

106
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,430
严格来说  要是他和佩妮有过亲密接触的话
Technically, it would only be rebound if he and penny

107
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,330
那才能算是缓解压力
Had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,670
你是说像你和女奴理查德[男子名]那样吗
You mean like you and richard the slave girl?

109
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,700
我给他买了晚饭  然后亲了一下
I bought him dinner and we kissed once!

110
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,870
就结束了
That was it.

111
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,930
而且他告诉我他叫金伯利
And he told me his name was kimberly.

112
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,900
你知道我们如何知道我们不是在母体里的么[骇客帝国]
You know how I know we're not in the matrix?

113
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,330
如何
How?

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,100
如果我们是的话  这些食物就不会这么糟了
If we were, the food would be better.

115
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,130
嗨  莱纳德
Hey, Leonard.

116
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,230
嗨  莱斯利
Hey, Leslie.

117
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,230
嗨  傻蛋
Hey, dummy.

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,730
你好
Hello, to you...

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,670
你这个智商不够的人
Insufficiently intelligent person.

120
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,930
快把我送到烧伤病房[阿甘正传里台词]
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

121
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,800
莱纳德  你有空么
Hey, Leonard, do you have a second?

122
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,230
-我想问你几个问题 -当然
-I need to ask you something. -sure.

123
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,430
如果你不介意的话
Well, if you'll excuse me,

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,700
我要去做一些成绩斐然的工作
I'm going to go do work that promises

125
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,730
而不像你做的
Significant results, as opposed to what you do...

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
那些没有意义的
Which does not.

127
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,700
没错  就是说你呢
Yeah, you heard me.

128
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,500
我听说你和佩妮吹了
So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground

129
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,370
就像从飞机厕所里扔出的蓝冰一样吹了
Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.

130
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,830
这你是听谁说的
Where did you hear that?

131
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,770
其实是我读到的  沃罗威茨发短信给我
Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

132
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,000
"就像从飞机厕所里扔出的蓝冰一样"  好吧
"like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

133
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,130
我觉得这个笑话很不错  我发给他一个LOL[笑脸]
I thought it was a pretty good one. I gave him an lol.

134
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,570
不过  这让我想到
Anyway, it got me thinking.

135
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,970
你现在是单身一人
Now that you're unattached,

136
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,530
说不定我们能重温一下之前的关系
Maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.

137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,130
你是在暗示再来一次"舒缓压力"么
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,730
不  我受够临时性爱了
No, I'm all done with casual sex.

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,030
从现在开始
From now on, I'm fully committed

140
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,870
我只要传统的关系模式
To the traditional relationship paradigm.

141
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,070
真的  这之间有什么不同
Really? what changed?

142
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,600
很难说
It's hard to say.

143
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,170
我想大概在每个女人一生总有那么一段时间
I guess there's just a time in every woman's life

144
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,130
厌倦了醒来发现自己躺在陌生的沙发上
When she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon

145
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,030
和一群她根本不认识的人在一起
With a bunch of people she doesn't know.

146
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,370
我明白  一群人
Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?

147
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,230
无论如何  我想该是慢慢来的时候了
Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down

148
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,630
又有谁比你更适合慢慢来呢
And who better to slow things down with than you?

149
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,600
噢  我深感荣幸
Oh... I'm flattered.

150
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,230
那你认为我们应该怎么开始
So how do you suggest we proceed?

151
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,830
去你家  点份中国菜  租一部电影
Your place, we'll order chinese, you'll rent a movie--

152
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,100
文艺一点但不要那么深奥  然后轻轻的抚摸  不发生性关系
Artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.

153
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,670
听起来不错
Sounds fun.

154
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,170
你可以来决定那些细节部分
I'll leave the details up to you.

155
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,970
我想如果你设想你是男性角色的话会比较好
I think it's better if you assume the male role.

156
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,600
谢谢  想的真周到
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

157
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,730
好
Great.

158
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
给我电话
Call me.

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,780
好消息
Great news.

160
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,250
我妈把我的N64游戏机[任天堂的]寄来了
My mom sent me my old nintendo 64.

161
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,250

-Terrific -you know what this means, don't you?

162
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,780
把红牛那关打通之后
Break out the red bull,

163
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,210
马里奥差不多就能通关了  怀念旧日校园生活啊
It's time to rock mario, old school.

164
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,550
今天晚上貌似我有别的计划了

可今天是星期五啊

星期五一直都是怀旧电玩之夜呀
Friday's always vintage game night.

167
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,680
你看我妈把记忆卡也寄来了
Look, mom included the memory card.

168
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,810
我们可以从我1999年的纪录接着打
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999

169
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,050
那时候我得了恶性贫血症
When I had pernicious anemia.

170
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,210
问题是有人要来
Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.

171
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,810
没关系  我有三副手柄
Okay, no problem. I have three controllers.

172
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,980
人多齐欢乐
The more the merrier.

173
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,310
谢尔顿  是个约会

我有个约会
I have a date coming over.

175
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,610
不要怪我猜不到是这么回事
Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.

176
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,080
为什么  我有约会这事很新奇么
Why? what's so unusual about me having a date?

177
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,150
统计学意义上  是的
Well, statistically speaking...

178
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,980
好吧
All right, all right.

179
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,580
不管怎么说  我有个约会

Which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.

185
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,710
我还能更稀缺点么
How much scarcer could I be?

186
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,280
你知道我的意思的
You know what I mean.

187
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,750
你能不能给我们一点私人空间
Could you just give us a little privacy?

188
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,010
-你想让我离开这个公寓  -是的

Well, why should I leave? this is my apartment, too.

193
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,680
我知道  如果科学家能够发现你们种族里
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member

194
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
你的另一个同类  如果你们两个想要一点隐私
Of your species and you two would like some privacy,

195
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,510
我绝对乐意不碍你的事
I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.

196
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,310
那好吧
Well, all right then.

197
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,050
谢尔顿  你在这干嘛呢

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,010
但你干嘛坐在楼梯上玩
Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?

201
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,880
我就是当代拿破仑
I am a modern day napoleon

202
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,050
被驱逐到楼梯间的厄尔巴岛
Exiled to the elba of the staircase

203
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,080
因为莱纳德告诉我他要约会
Because Leonard, get this, has a date.

204
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,880
他动作真快嘛

205
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,410
但你为什么要坐这玩呢
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?

206
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,810
你为什么不去看场电影  玩点别的
Why don't you just go to a movie or something?

自己去
Alone?

208
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,850
对啊  怎么了
Yeah, why not?

209
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,710
如果我被爆米花噎住了
What if I choke on my popcorn?

210
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,910
谁对我实施哈姆立克急救法
Who will administer the heimlich maneuver?

211
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,180
别买爆米花不就行了
Well, then don't order popcorn.

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
看电影不吃爆米花  听听你自己说的
No popcorn at the mov... listen to yourself.

213
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,550
你为什么不去咖啡店呢
Why don't you go to a coffee shop?

214
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,580
我不喝咖啡

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,180
莱斯利·温克尔
Leslie winkle.

223
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,010
全世界这么多实验室里
Of all the overrated physicists

224
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
这么多被高估的物理学家
In all the labs in all the world,

225
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,550
为什么偏偏就选中了莱斯利·温克尔
Why does it have to be leslie winkle?

226
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,680
因为他们有很多共同点啊
Well, they have a lot in common.

227
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,110
我是说  他们都是科学家
I mean, they're both scientists.

228
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,810
求你了  如果他们要重新把猩猩送上太空
Oh, please. the only way she could make

229
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
那就是她对科学
A contribution to science would be

230
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,080
唯一的贡献
If they resumed sending chimps into space.

231
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,880
好吧  我也有个约会

我只是在使唤你

Not chow's? no, chang's.

240
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,830
周记出什么问题了
What happened to chow's?

241
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,260
变了
It changed.

242
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,660
你觉得我们应该要几个孩子
So, how many children do you think we should have?

243
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,060
抱歉  这个有点唐突了
I'm sorry. that was a little abrupt.

244
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,530
只是有点
A little?

245
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
我是说  我们有那么多事情可以说
I mean, there are so many things to talk about

246
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,730
干嘛要讨论繁殖问题
Before we discuss reproduction.

247
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,060
我也希望是
I sure hope so.

248
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,730
除了短小
Besides shortness,

249
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,500
你们家族还有什么基因缺陷
What genetic weaknesses run in your family?

250
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,730
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

251
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,130
电池要没电了  你们继续
Battery's dying. continue.

252
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,700
基因缺陷  对
Uh, genetic weakness, right.

253
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
有一个乳糖不耐症
Uh, there's the lactose intolerance.

254
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,200
别忘了说男性秃头
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.

255
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,560
他的叔叔们坐在餐桌旁的时候
When his uncles sit around the dinner table,

256
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,200
看起来就像半盒鸡蛋摆在那
They look like a half carton of eggs.

257
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,160
好吧  我的叔叔们都是秃头  不过我的婶婶艾德娜
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald, but my aunt edna

258
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,530
是你将遇见的头发最多的女人之一  所以

259
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,900
漂亮女人
Sweet lady.

260
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,400
每次她抱我的时候都挠我痒痒
Always tickles when she hugs me.

261
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,200
又怎么了
What now?

262
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,760
我要撒尿尿
I have to make pee-pee.

263
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,460
我很抱歉谢尔顿的打扰
Listen, I'm sorry about all of sheldon's interruptions.

264
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,400
他总是有点怪怪的
He can be a bit of an eccentric.

265
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,730
如果"怪怪的"是指消极攻击人格[看似支持  其实捣乱]
If by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressive

266
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,730
东德州的风孔  那我倒同意
East texas blowhole, I agree.

267

我想今晚是一个很好的开始
I think tonight was a very good start.

268
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
我也觉得
Me, too.

269
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,400
你确定你可以推迟交往
Are you sure you're okay postponing intercourse

270
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,700
直到我们的关系度过了最初的可行性测试吗
Until our relationship is past the initial viability test?

271
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,100
没问题
No, problem.

272
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,260
我非常擅长于推迟交往
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.

273
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,500
我想我可以打电话给你
I guess I'll call you

274
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,300
然后我们再安排另外一个约会
And we'll arrange another evening.

275
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,560
可以  我相信协议指出了你至少
Yes, I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum

276
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,930
要等18个小时才能打电话给我
Of 18 hours before you call

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,760
这样我才不会厌恶你的猴急
So I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.

278
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,960
可以
Sure.

279
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,230
再说一次  你自己决定  你是男人
Again, it's your decision. you're the man.

280
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,630
不是我的猫
It wasn't my cat.

281
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
是一个试验
It was an experiment

282
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,330
一个薛定谔的人设计的
Designed by this guy named schroedinger.

283
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,400
是查理·布朗动画片里面的[史努比动画片]
From the charlie brown cartoons?

284
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,500
不是  他是个科学家
No, he was some kind of scientist.

285
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,130
我重新说一遍
Let me start again.

286
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
嘿  莱纳德
Oh, hey, leonard.

287
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,830
你好
Hello.

288
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,830
莱斯利
Leslie.

289
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,230
你好
Hi.

290
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,900
好吧  晚安
Okay, well, good night.

291
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,130
好吧  晚安
Okay, well, good night.

292
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,460
还不够劲
That ain't gonna make your point.

293
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,500
够了
That's enough.

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,900
给我电话
Call me.

295
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,900
好的
Right.

296
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,360
好的  晚安
Okay, good night.

297
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,230
什么
Uh, what?

298
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,000
今天不错  再见
Had a great time. ciao.

299
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,730
抱歉  我不会再去那个文艺复兴集会了
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the renaissance fair.

300
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,260
拜托  谢尔顿
Come on, sheldon.

301
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,700
没有多少地方我可以穿杰斯特的服装[小丑]
There's so few places I can wear my jester costume.

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,630
我才不管  那里太多历史怪人了
I don't care. there are far too many historical anomalies

303
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,960
不对我的胃口
For my comfort.

304
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,630
好吧  你看这个如何
Okay, how about this?

305
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,360
你可以穿装扮成星际迷航的科学官
You can go dressed as a star trek science officer

306
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,360
探索一个类似十六世纪地球的星球
Exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s.

307
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,160
你是说像斯坡克那样[企业号上的科学官]
You mean, like spock?

308
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,700
对的
Sure.

309
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,200
太棒了
Fascinating.

310
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,200
嘿  科学家小伙们
Hey, fellow scientists...

311
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

312
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,430
我们干嘛不移到那边去  这样莱斯利就可以坐在一起了
Why don't we all move over there so leslie can join us?

313
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,760
好的  去吧
Yeah, let's do it.

314
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,530
如果你很难决定去做哪边
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit,

315
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
我可以建议看一下是一个土豆  两个土豆[影片名]
May I suggest one potato, two potato?

316
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,300
或者我叫它 "莱斯利·温克尔的实验性方法论"
Or as I call it, "the leslie winkle experimental methodology."

317
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,400
别让我难做啊
Don't make this hard for me.

318
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,760
一点也不难
It's not hard.

319
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,800
非常简单  你要么跟我
It's simple. you can either sit with me,

320
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,330
你的朋友  同事还有室友一起坐
Your friend, colleague and roommate

321
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,260
要么跟一个你们可能一起睡过的
Or you can sit with an overrated scientist

322
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,530
高估的科学家一起坐
You might have sex with.

323
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,560
你说对了  非常简单
You're right, it is simple.

324
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,930
嘿  谢尔顿
Hey, sheldon.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,300
佩妮
Penny.

326
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,630
今晚跑三楼了  弄不清了
Third floor tonight-- mixing it up?

327
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,630
我还是不明白为什么
I still don't understand why

328
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
你不去吃饭或是什么
You don't just go to dinner or something.

329
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,200
好吧
All right,

330
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,000
那我们就说我独自去吃饭
Let's say I go to dinner alone,

331
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,330
我吃饭的时候  如果我要去上厕所
And during the meal, I have to use the restroom.

332
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,670
我怎么知道有没有人碰了我的食物
How do I know someone's not touching my food?

333
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,700
晚安  谢尔顿
Good night, sheldon.

334
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,530
佩妮  等一下
Penny, hold on.

335
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,130
你确定你和莱纳德没戏了
Are you sure things can't work out with you and leonard?

336
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
你说什么
Excuse me?

337
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,400
我只是在想 如果你能试试旧学院派的做法
I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try.

338
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,570
或者就你而言  旧社区大学的做法
Or in your case, the old community college try.

339
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,630
好了  这从何说起
Okay, where is this coming from?

340
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,670
莱纳德此刻正在楼上和我的死敌在一起
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.

341
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,430
你的死敌
Your archenemy?

342
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,230
是的  就如毁灭博士对神奇侠
Yes, the dr. doom to my mr. fantastic.

343
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,230
章鱼博士对蜘蛛侠
Dr. octopus to my spider-man,

344
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,070
西瓦那博士对超人上尉
The dr. sivana to my captain marvel.

345
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,970
我明白了  明白了  明白了
I get it, I get it, I get it.

346
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,870
那你知道  这么多超人都有
Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains

347
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,130
高学位有多棒吗
Have advanced degrees.

348
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,300
学校毕业后可以找个比大多数人
Graduate school should probably do a better job

349
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,070
做得都好的工作
Of screening those people out.

350
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,100
谢尔顿  打住  你把我绕晕了
Sheldon, come back. you're losing me.

351
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,630
我的死敌是莱斯利·温克尔  佩妮
It's leslie winkle, penny.

352
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,630
她看不起我的研究
She belittles my research.

353
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
亲爱的  太遗憾了
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

354
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,370
她叫我"傻蛋"
She called me "dumbass."

355
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,600
我知道  听见了
I know. I heard.

356
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,130
现在看来  无奈之下
Given this situation, I have no choice

357
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,970
我只能收回我之前对
But to withdraw my previous objections

358
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,430
你和莱纳德关系的反对
To your ill-considered relationship with leonard.

359
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,770
那还真要谢谢你了
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.

360
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,100
不过我想目前
But I think for now,

361
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,000
莱纳德和我只能做朋友了
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.

362
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,970
不行  我不接受你这样的回答
No, that response is unacceptable to me.

363
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,470
谢尔顿  你是个聪明人
Sheldon, you are a smart guy.

364
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,740
-你一定知道  -我"聪明"
You must know... I'm "smart"?

365
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,290
我要是被归类为"聪明"  我的智商测试就要少六十分了
I'd have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as "smart."

366
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,600
你还让我说下去吗
Are you gonna let me talk?

367
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,200
对不起
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,030
你一定知道如果莱纳德和莱斯利要在一起
You must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together,

369
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,930
你怎么做都阻止不了的
Nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

370
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,530
你又在低估我的智商了  小姐
You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.

371
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
好了  这么说好了
Okay, let me put it this way.

372
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,200
如果你拿莱纳德当朋友  你要支持他
If you're really leonard's friend, you will support him

373
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,900
不管他和谁在一起
No matter who he wants to be with.

374
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,670
等会
Wait a minute.

375
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,170
为什么老要我支持他
Why am I doing all the giving here?

376
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,670
如果莱纳德拿我当朋友
If leonard's really my friend,

377
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,000
为什么他不支持我
Why doesn't he have to support me

378
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,930
讨厌莱斯利·温克尔
An my hatred of leslie winkle?

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,300
因为爱大于恨
Because love trumps hate.

380
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,370
哦  你现在是和事佬了
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.

381
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,970
好了  晚安  谢尔顿
Okay, good night, sheldon.

382
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,430
马里奥  真希望能像控制你一样
Oh, mario, if only I could control everyone

383
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,270
控制所有人
The way I control you.

384
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,830
跳呀  你这小管道工  跳跳跳
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.

385
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,890
当你们到自然暂停时
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point,

386
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,190
我想说点事
I'd like to have a word.

387
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,190
你要说的是"尿尿"  去就好了
The word is "pee-pee." just do it.

388
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,650
莱纳德  你是我朋友
Leonard, you're my friend,

389
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,190
朋友就应该支持朋友
And friends support their friends...

390
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,520
显然如此
Apparently.

391
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,320
所以我收回对你想和莱斯利发展 的反对
So I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie.

392
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,150
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,750
我会很绅士地
I will graciously

394
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,390
忽略一个事实  她是个又傲慢
Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant,

395
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,890
水平又低的科学家  竟然认为圈量子引力论
Subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity

396
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,320
比弦理论更好地结合了
Better unites quantum mechanics with generally relativity

397
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,690
量子力学和广义相对论
Than does string theory.

398
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,290
你们好好玩
You kids have fun.

399
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,450
等下
Hang on a second.

400
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,820
圈量子引力论比弦理论更明确地提供了
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions

401
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,150
可验证的假设
Than string theory.

402
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,590
我听着呢  嘲弄我吧
I'm listening. amuse me.

403
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,820
好的  首先  在量子时空观里
Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time

404
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,390
细小的不同呈现为
To manifest itself as minute differences

405
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,090
不同光谱的不同速度
In the speed of light for different colors.

406
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,690
胡扯  事物显然是由无数细小闭弦组成的
Balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

407
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,690
你就让他这么和我说话
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?

408
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,320
两种理论都有道理
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.

409
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,650
不  不是的  只有圈量子引力论
