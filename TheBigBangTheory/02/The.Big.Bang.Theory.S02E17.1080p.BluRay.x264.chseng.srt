1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,470
好了  拉杰
Okay, raj.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,920
把6号螺丝刀递给我
Hand me the #6 torx screwdriver.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,170
停
Stop.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,660
不能这么做  这样不对
We can't do this. it's not right.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,550
谢尔顿  你只有两个选择
Sheldon, you have two choices.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,480
出城之前  要么换个大点的硬盘
Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo,

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,470
要么删掉一些数据
Or you delete stuff before we go out of town.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,760
但是一旦开箱  保修单就作废了
But once you open the box, you've voided the warranty.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,920
保修单可是
The warranty is a sacred covenant

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,340
我们和生产商之间的神圣契约
We've entered into with the manufacturer.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,260
他提供设备的保障
He offers to stand by his equipment,

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,170
我们则保证不开箱
And we in return agree not to violate

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,760
亵渎内部硬件
The integrity of the internal hardware.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,080
这张小贴纸就是辨别我们是否守法的标志
This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,200
行  那我们不碰硬件
Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,250
直接删除《太空堡垒》第1季
We'll just erase the first season of battlestar.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,180
行了  我们违法吧
There. we're outlaws.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,220
给  莱纳德  这个够大吗
Here you go, leonard. is this going to be big enough?

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,300
刚好
It's perfect.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,990
给独角兽带水仙花差不多够了
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,360
只是拿来装笔记本的
It's just for my notebooks.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,240
谢谢  佩妮
Thanks, penny.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,630
我好喜欢旧金山
I love san francisco.

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,980
真想和你们一起去
I wish I was going with you.

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,570
我很理解你会嫉妒
I understand your envy.

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,540
这是绝不能错过的研讨会
This is a can't-miss symposium.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,930
在那儿会讨论
There are going to be discussions

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,540
生物细胞计算机元件
on bioorganic cellular computer devices,

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,050
多线程任务处理的优势
The advancements in multi-threaded task completion,

30
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,860
还有用非平衡格林函数解决
Plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium green's function approach

31
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,880
原子内光化电离过程的圆桌会议呢
to the photoionization process in atoms.

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,170
我通常只去玩击锤和坐缆车
When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.

33
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,230
这次会议挺大型的
This conference is kind of a big thing.

34
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,430
由乔治·斯穆特做开场发言呢
The keynote address is being delivered by george smoot.

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,050
偶滴神啊  乔治·斯穆特
Oh, my god, the george smoot?

36
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,110
你听说过他吗
You've heard of him?

37
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,520
当然没有
Of course I haven't.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,890
乔治·斯穆特是个物理学家  诺贝尔奖得主
George smoot is a nobel prize-winning physicist,

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,060
当代伟人之一
One of the great minds of our time.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,840
他对黑体和宇宙微波背景辐射的
His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,050
各向异性的研究 跟宇宙起源的观点有许多相通之处
Background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,990
名字挺搞笑的  斯穆特
It's kind of a funny name, though-- "smoot."

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,890
对牛牛弹琴
It's like talking to a chimp.

44
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,460
既然在这被羞辱了  就祝你们飞行愉快
Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,410
我倒是想坐飞机呢
Yeah, I wish.

46
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,610
我们不坐飞机  坐火车
We're not flying. we're taking the train.

47
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,180
-挺酷的  -太苦了
- Oh, cool. - yeah, cool.

48
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,060
比坐飞机长7倍的时间  还贵2倍的价钱
Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,350
那干嘛坐火车
Well, then why are you doing it?

50
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,650
我们投过票
Well, we had a vote.

51
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,120
3个投坐飞机
Three of us voted for airplane.

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,210
但谢尔顿投坐火车
Sheldon voted for train.

53
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,430
所以只能坐火车
So we're taking the train.

54
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,190
别这么说嘛  莱纳德
Don't say it like that,Leonard.

55
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,800
这么说  我们可算能坐回火车咯O(∩_∩)O
Say it like "we're taking the train!"

56
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,070
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第17集

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,740
我们准备去苹果专卖店
We're all going over to the apple store

58
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,980
戏弄那些技术人员
To make fun of the guys at the genius bar.

59
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,550
你去吗
You want to come?

60
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,510
我很喜欢玩这个  但现在有点忙
Oh, I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.

61
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,350
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

62
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,060
我在简化打包行李的任务
I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip.

63
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,590
瞧  给衣物贴上电子标签
See, by attaching rfid tags to my clothing,

64
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,170
就能用识别笔
It will enable my laptop

65
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,690
激活笔记本读取和鉴别它们
to read and identify the items with this wand.

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,060
然后我就能参照目的地
I will then cross-reference them against destination,

67
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,640
预先安排的活动幅度
Anticipated activity spectrum,

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,790
天气情况  旅行时长  等等来确定带什么去
weather conditions, duration of trip,Et cetera.

69
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,950
确实简化了不少
Well, that does sound much simpler.

70
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,120
你还要多长时间
How long is this going to take?

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,030
以现在的速度  3小时11分钟
Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes,

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,950
还要鉴于这次毫无意义的
And plus however long it takes

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,120
对话的时长
To conclude this fairly pointless conversation.

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,520
现在感觉戏弄苹果的技术人员有点多余
Wow. teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now.

75
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,920
我没听懂
I don't follow.

76
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,250
我也不想你听懂  一会见
I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

77
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,520
袜子一对  棉质  菱形花纹  蓝色
Sock, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,390
袜子一对  棉质  菱形花纹  蓝色
Sock, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,090
你们这是干嘛
What on earth are you doing?

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,650
不管是什么  看来都是错的
Whatever it is, I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,460
先生们  这可是海岸星光号
Gentlemen, this is the coast starlight,

82
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,370
全美最好的火车之一
One of the great american trains

83
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,330
行驶在全美最经典线路之一
Operating on one of the classic american routes.

84
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,360
在这边
On this side,

85
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,330
可以看到全海景
You'll see panoramic ocean vistas

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,910
任何运输工具都无法做到这点
inaccessible to any other form of transportation,

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,550
而这边
while on your side,

88
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,560
你只能面对350英里上的好市多超市
you'll be treated to 350 miles of costcos,

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,450
捷飞络汽车服务店
jiffy lubes,

90
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,250
带凸地泳池的煤渣砖房子
and cinder block homes with above-ground pools.

91
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,090
走吧  拉杰
Come on, raj.

92
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,620
捷飞络有什么不好
What's wrong with jiffy lubes?

93
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,790
不对
No.

94
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,620
为什么
Why not?

95
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,790
超出轴距了
That's over the wheelbase.

96
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,420
你们对1980前期普式火车上
Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension

97
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,720
超级豪华的 悬浮座椅一点都不知道吗
Characteristics of a pre-1980 pullman-built superliner deluxe passenger coach?

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,860
谢尔顿  我们上火车才90秒
Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds,

99
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,890
你就说了几万个字
And you've already said a thousand words.

100
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,750
直接说坐哪  然后闭嘴
Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

101
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,050
这里
Here.

102
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,530
我希望你听着规律的车轮和铁轨的撞击声
I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady

103
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,300
得到脑袋产生的安多芬犒劳后
Clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails,

104
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,320
焦躁能有所缓解
Your sour disposition will abate.

105
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,490
可能吧
Yeah, maybe.

106
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,830
与此同时  回到21世纪
Meanwhile, back in the 21st century,

107
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,280
人们也开始收托盘桌 支起座椅背
People are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,260
因为已经到旧金山了
'cause it's time to land in san francisco.

109
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,070
已经不错了
It's not so bad, really.

110
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,040
至少这种火车有现代管道系统
At least these trains have modern plumbing.

111
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,500
在印度
In india,

112
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,840
你只能蹲在车厢里的一个洞上面
You squat over a hole in the train and expose

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,410
把屁屁曝光在拉贾斯坦的冰冷空气中
and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,210
他这是个比喻
He is referring, of course,

115
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,810
比作乘坐印度铁路宏伟的千柱之庙特快的三等旅客
To third class on indian railways' magnificent ranakpur express and its

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,840
和从马哈拉施特拉邦到比卡内尔枢纽站 1200公里的旅程
1,200-kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction.

117
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,840
看吧  他现在无聊到有够国际水准了
Oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.

118
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,240
我靠  快看
Holy crap! look!

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
真的是她么  没可能吧
Is that who I think it is? it can't be.

120
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,640
萨默·格萝怎么会来坐火车的
What would summer glau be doing riding the train?

121
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,340
可能约翰·康纳上车了 她来保护他  对付屠魔侠
Maybe john connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil terminator.

122
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,870
不太像  那是电视剧  莱纳德
Unlikely. that's a television show, leonard.

123
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,440
谢了
Thank you.

124
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,300
当然  如果未来天网真的存在
Of course, if skynet actually did exist in the future,

125
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,100
侵入并毁灭人类最好的方法将会是将终结者送去
A perfect way to infiltrate and destroy  mankind would be

126
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,100
摆成在著名的电影电视中出演终结者的演员的造型
to send terminators back posing as actors who have played terminators in

127
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,300
让我们在臆想的安全感中苟且偷生
Popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense

128
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,440
比如  那是终结者外传中的萨默·格萝
a false sense of security, i.e., "that's summer glau "from the sarah connor chronicles.

129
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,200
不  萨默  不要杀我 我真的是机器人
"no, summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot! ahh!"

130
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,040
至少他不再唠叨那些关于火车的废话了
At least he's off the train crap.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
谢尔顿  我应该向你道歉
Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

132
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,670
坐上这辆火车是我一生中最幸运的事
Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance!

133
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,970
我居然有机会把到一个终结者
I've actually got a shot at a terminator.

134
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,560
拜托
Oh, please.

135
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,070
如果说到终结者
When it comes to terminators,

136
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,570
你也就能泡到阿诺德·施瓦辛格
You've got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
你忽略了某件事
You're overlooking something.

138
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,740
我将与她在一个密闭的空间中共处11个小时
I have 11 hours with her in a confined space.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,070
除非她愿意跳火车
Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train,

140
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,700
从山坡上滚下去
Tuck and roll down the side of a hill,

141
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,100
她终将屈服于霍华德·沃罗威茨的魔掌之下
She will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is howard wolowitz.

142
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,770
我赌她会跳火车
My money's on tuck and roll.

143
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,640
我很困惑
I'm confused.

144
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,580
我以为你正身陷于
I thought you were involved in some sort of

145
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,600
与莱斯利·温克尔的亲密关系中
Socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle.

146
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,440
-谢尔顿  告诉你这是为什么吧  -好吧
Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works. all right.

147
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,100
-那是萨默·格萝  -所以呢
-That's summer glau. -yes.

148
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,300
就这样了
That's it.

149
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,400
慢着
Hang on a sec.

150
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,970
为什么让你先去泡她
Why do you get first crack at her?

151
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,870
有这样几个原因
Um, well, let's see, couple reasons.

152
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,740
第一  是我先看到她的
One, I saw her first.

153
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,970
不是你  是我
No, you didn't. I did.

154
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,540
好吧
Fair enough.

155
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,840
但是  让我说下原因二
But... then, let me move on to #2.

156
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,270
不像你  我不用喝醉也可以和女人交谈
Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.

157
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,530
你忘了一件事  我即使不说话也具有异国情调
You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic,

158
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,700
哪像你  又弱又白的
While you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.

159
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,400
古语说的好  又弱又白不会挂
Well, you know the old saying, "pasty and frail never fail."

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,740
拜托  那我呢
Excuse me, but what about me?

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,100
为什么我就不能试试的
Why don't I get a shot?

162
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,000
好吧  去吧
Fine, go ahead.

163
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,840
去试试
Take a shot.

164
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,260
你知道
You know,

165
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,170
我已经有个泡不到的金发美女在家了
I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home that I can't score with.

166
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,000
我就让你们两个泡这个吧
I think I'll let you two take this one.

167
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,840
谢尔顿  火车上有没有卖酒的
Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?

168
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,270
问得好
Interesting that you ask.

169
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,840
海岸星光号最近新增了重新装修的太平洋休闲车厢
The coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car.

170
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,710
始建于1956年  最初叫做圣达菲上等车厢
Built in 1956 and originally known as the santa fe lounge car,

171
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,640
-下层是剧院 上层是酒吧  提供...  -行了  怎么走
The lower level is a theater and the upper  Level is a bar that offers -which way?

172
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,700
提供酒品  如果你一直坐到波特兰
Wine tastings if you're going as far as portland.

173
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,740
你到底去不去和她搭讪
So aren't you going to go talk to her?

174
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
我会去的  正在想开场白呢
I will, I'm just working on my opening line.

175
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,040
霍华德  她什么开场白没听过啊
She's probably heard every possible line, howard.

176
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,570
你简单地嗨一下不就行了
Why don't you just try "hello"?

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,970
不不不  那样会吓坏女孩子的
No, no, no, that always creeps girls out.

178
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,930
我得想点幽默的
I need to come up with something that's funny,

179
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,820
聪明又微妙地提示她
Smart and delicately suggests that my sexual

180
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,370
我的性禀赋和我的身高不成比例
Endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.

181
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
我看你11个小时是想不出来了
You're going to need more than 11 hours.

182
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,040
-坏了  -怎么了
-Oh, no. -what's the matter?

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,670
-我忘带我的优盘了  -所以呢
-I forgot my flash drive. -so?

184
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,170
所以我们必须回去
So we have to go back.

185
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
谢尔顿  我会问你为什么
Okay, sheldon, I'm going to say "why"

186
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,000
但你不能回答因为我忘带我的优盘了
And your answer cannot be "because I forgot my flash drive."

187
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,440
你不明白
You don't understand.

188
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,930
我的优盘里有我的关于早期宇宙中
My flash drive has my paper on

189
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,070
M理论效应的天体物理学探索的论文
Astrophysical probes of m-theory effects in

190
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,940
我本来打算在会上
The early universe that I was going to

191
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,900
给乔治·斯穆特的
Give to george smoot at the conference.

192
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,890
你为什么要把你的论文给乔治·斯穆特
Why do you have to give your paper to george smoot?

193
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,740
写得太好了  他需要读一读
It's brilliant. he needs to read it.

194
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,430
你可以等咱们回来发邮件给他的嘛
So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.

195
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,090
那我就看不到他读我论文时两眼放光的表情啦
Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.

196
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
当然了
Right. of course.

197
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,430
真是糟糕透顶
Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

198
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,190
事已至此  无力回天  您就歇会吧
Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax.

199
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,200
向后靠 迷醉在车轮与锃亮的铁轨撞击的咔哒咔哒声中
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.

200
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:48,330
你忘带了优盘...
You forgot your flash drive...

201
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,720
忍十个小时55分钟就好
Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.

202
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,410
这里真热啊[真性感啊]
It's hot in here.

203
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,470
一定到夏天了[一定是萨默]
Must be summer.

204
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,940
那么 美眉们去哪啊
So... Where you gals headed?

205
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,330
我想出完美的解决办法了
Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,930
我们在下一站奥克斯纳德下车
We get off the train at the next stop in oxnard.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,200
然后乘坐1:13的火车返回联合车站
We then take the 1:13 train back to union station.

208
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,830
打车回公寓  拿上我的优盘
We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive,

209
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,690
冲向圣路易斯奥比斯波
And then race to san luis obispo, where,

210
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,300
假设一路绿灯路上无人  我们就能赶上火车
Assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.

211
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,470
我有个更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

212
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,030
你又想讽刺我
Are you going to be sarcastic?

213
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
孩子  你把我的乐趣都剥夺了
Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.

214
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,430
看  佩妮在家呢
Look, penny's home.

215
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,670
为什么不打给她  让她去我们家
Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment,

216
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,530
把你优盘里的论文发到你邮箱里呢
Get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?

217
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,970
-但是优盘在我那个上锁的抽屉里  -所以呢
But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk. so?

218
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,600
钥匙藏在我的房间里
The key is hidden in my room.

219
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,630
-所以呢  -佩妮需要进去我的房间
So? penny would have to go into my room.

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,270
-所以呢  -没有人可以进我房间
So? people don't go in my room!

221
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,600
我懂了
I see.

222
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,570
看来你又一次陷入了进退两难的境地
Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
真讨厌这种感觉
Oh, I hate when that happens.

224
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,730
这儿真热
It's hot in here.

225
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,580
现在肯定是夏天
It must be summer.

226
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,270
这儿真热
It's hot in here.

227
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,430
肯定是夏天
Must be summer.

228
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,570
这儿真热  肯定是夏天
It's hot in here. must be summer.

229
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
这儿真热
It's hot in here.

230
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,200
肯定是夏天
Must be summer.

231
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,000
-这种说法真有趣  -真的
That's cute. really?

232
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,170
是我编的
I just made it up.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,770
你看过贫民窟的百万富翁了没
Have you seen slumdog millionaire?

234
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,330
看过了  我太喜欢了
Oh, yeah, I loved it.

235
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,370
某种程度来说它是以我为原型来写的
It's loosely based on my life.

236
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:34,870
嗯
Yeah,

237
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,030
我们准备把表演放在某个晚上  在一个99座的剧院里
We're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theater.

238
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,170
你能来吗
Can you come?

239
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,430
太好了
Oh, great.

240
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,430
你知道还有哪98人会想来吗
Do you know 98 other people that might want to come?

241
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,170
噢  别挂
Oh, hang on.

242
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,270
喂
Hello?

243
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,400
听仔细了
Listen carefully.

244
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,340
我现在会给你一系列指示
I'm about to give you a set of instructions,

245
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,000
你照着我说的一步步做
Which you must follow to the letter.

246
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,200
等会儿
Just a sec.

247
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,450
剧场是建在一个保龄球馆上面的  可能有点吵
The theater is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy,

248
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,180
但这可能是我唯一一次扮演
But it might be the only chance I'll ever get

249
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,000
安妮·弗兰克的机会[安妮日记主人公]
to play anne frank.

250
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,530
而且那个导演太聪明了
And the director is brilliant.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,900
他利用打保龄球的声音  当作是纳粹的炮火声
He uses the bowling sounds as, like, nazi artillery.

252
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,900
好的  到时候见
Okay, great, I'll see you then.

253
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,170
喂
Hello?

254
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,800
第四步
Okay, step four.

255
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,000
你看到我化妆台上的塑料小盒吗
Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?

256
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,970
你的化妆台?  你是哪位?
Your dresser? who is this?

257
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,570
我是谢尔顿
It's sheldon.

258
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,130
噢  好啊  谢尔顿
Oh, hey, sheldon!

259
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,230
旧金山怎么样
How is san francisco?

260
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,770
我没在旧金山
I'm not in san francisco.

261
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,830
我在火车上
I'm on a train.

262
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,700
你到底有没有在听我说话
Were you even listening to me?

263
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,730
没有  我在跟朋友聊天  怎么了
Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?

264
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,770
怎么了  我来告诉你怎么了
What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

265
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,070
我现在性命交关
I'm in a crisis situation,

266
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,820
我现在要你集中所有小宇宙
And I need you to marshal your powers of concentration,

267
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,200
专心致志地...
Limited as they may be...

268
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,600
把电话给我
Give me the phone.

269
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,330
佩妮  我是莱纳德
Hi, penny. it's leonard.

270
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,470
嘿  莱纳德
Hey, leonard.

271
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,000
奇怪博士怎么了
What's going on with dr. wackadoodle?

272
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,630
他打来让你帮个忙的
He's calling to ask you a favor.

273
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,460
你肯定很奇怪  因为他没用佩妮  谢尔顿
You might be confused because he didn't use the words, "penny," "sheldon,

274
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,670
请  帮忙这几个词
" "please" or "favor."

275
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,900
好了
Okay.

276
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,100
闲聊得够了
Enough chitchat.

277
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,370
听好  第一步
Okay, step one.

278
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,930
找到我们房子的备用钥匙
Locate your emergency key to our apartment.

279
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,770
第二步  走进我们的房子
Step two, enter our apartment.

280
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,500
第三步...
Step three...

281
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,930
走进我的房间
Enter my bedroom.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
第四步...
Step four...

283
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,300
等等  谢尔顿  又有电话来了
Oh, hang on, sheldon, getting another call.

284
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,530
别挂
No!

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,970
莱纳德  我告诉你
Leonard, let me tell you something.

286
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,000
我太期待个人机器人助理的诞生了
Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.

287
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,170
那颗明亮的小星早早的就偷偷探出她的头
And that bright little star peeking her head out early today...

288
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,230
那就是金星
That's venus.

289
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,070
太赞了
That is so cool.

290
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,200
你对太空知道得真多
You really know a lot about space.

291
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,330
拜托
Come on.

292
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,530
你演电视剧萤火虫的时候  你可真的是在太空里啊
When you were on tv in firefly, you were actually in space.

293
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,270
你不会是那种真的相信那些是真的人吧
You're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?

294
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,100
你说那些没希望的怪人吗
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?

295
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,330
当然不是
No.

296
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,870
他们都是疯子
Those are crazy people.

297
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,330
霍华德  做做好人  帮我再拿一瓶
Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these.

298
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,100
告诉你  他就是那种白痴
Now, him, he's one of those geeks.

299
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,730
听着  在无第二方监视的情况下进入我房间之前
All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted,

300
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,460
我需要你明白这种一次性的
I need you to understand that this onetime

301
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,970
通行权并不能转换为永久性的
Grant of access does not create a permanent easement.

302
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,670
通行权
Easement.

303
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,930
是一种准许进入的法定权利
It's a legal right of access.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,330
老天她真无知
Good grief.

305
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,830
什么
What?

306
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
不行  别让我等着
No, don't put me on hold.

307
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,670
噢
Oh!

308
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,270
你敢相信吗
Do you believe him?

309
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,330
平时跟女人在一起  他就像个人形熟土豆
Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato.

310
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,800
喝了一瓶啤酒  他就成了把妹高手了
Put one beer in him, and he's m. night charmalarmalon.

311
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,730
这是他喝的吗
Is that what he's drinking?

312
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
这都不是真的啤酒
It's not even real beer.

313
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,170
-什么  -看这里
What? look at it.

314
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,570
无酒精啤酒
"non-alcoholic beer."

315
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,670
怎么回事
What's going on?

316
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,900
我不知道
I don't know.

317
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,430
我猜是某种安慰剂效应
Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

318
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,230
你说安慰剂
Placebo, you say.

319
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,970
有趣了
Interesting.

320
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,370
嗯  我还在  我还能去哪儿  我可是在火车上啊
Yes, I'm still here. where am I going? I'm on a train.

321
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,630
现在
Now,

322
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,430
你要找的是一个小型木制盒子
What you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located

323
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,330
放在霍伯曼球面和嵌着黄铜矿的石英样本中间
Between a hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

324
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,130
是霍伯曼球面
Hoberman's sphere.

325
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,870
就是一个可收缩的二十面球体
It's collapsible icosidodecahedron.

326
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,000
不  那个有时间的东西是我的闹钟
No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.

327
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,700
其实  在印度有不同的星座名字
Actually, in india, the names of constellations are different.

328
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,670
你们有北斗七星  我们则有咖喱大锅
Where you have the big dipper, we have the big curry pot.

329
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,600
那是你胡编的
You're making that up.

330
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,700
被你揭穿了
You got me.

331
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,400
那你准备怎么惩罚我?
Now what are you going to do with me?

332
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,970
-拉杰  -什么事?
Raj. yes?

333
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,530
-看啊  -这是什么?
Look. what am I looking at?

334
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
你说呢
You tell me.

335
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,570
无酒精啤酒
"non-alcoholic beer."

336
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,530
嗨  我就是别人常说的小身材大智慧
Hi. I'm the small package good things come in.

337
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,030
好吧  我是找到一个盒子  但里面只有信没有钥匙
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. just letters.

338
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,800
不是那个盒子  放回去
That's the wrong box. put it back.

339
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,730
谢尔顿  这是你奶奶寄来的信吗?
Oh, sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?

340
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
别看那些信!
Don't read those letters!

341
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,470
看呀  她管你叫小甜派
Oh, look, she calls you "moon pie."

342
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,600
好可爱啊
That is so cute.

343
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,670
不准看信!
Put down the letters!

344
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,900
嗨  佩妮  我是莱纳德
Hey, penny. it's leonard.

345
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,100
嗨  莱纳德  坐火车感觉如何?
Hey, leonard. how's the train ride?

346
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,630
相当愉快
Delightful.

347
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,520
听着  我不知你现在干嘛
Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now,

348
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,300
但谢尔顿稍稍有些咬牙切齿了
But there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldon's mouth.

349
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,400
好吧  我是有点过火了
Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line.

350
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,400
让他接吧
Put him back on.

351
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,800
谢谢哦
Thank you.

352
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,770
我回来了
I'm back.

353
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,900
怎么啦  小甜派?
What up, moon pie?

354
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,130
只有我奶奶才这么叫我!
Nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw!

355
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,830
嗨  佩妮  又是我莱纳德
Hey, penny. leonard again.

356
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,900
不管怎样  在梦里  我们两个在滑冰  二人世界
So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us.

357
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,730
然后
And then,

358
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,580
我抬起你的脚踝  带着你
I picked you up by your ankles and twirled

359
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,930
转了一圈又一圈  直到你的腿都掉下来了
You round and round until your legs tore off.

360
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,600
我试着把它们粘回去  不过在那之前
I tried to stick them back on, but before I could,

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,530
你已变身成一只巨大的黑面包
You turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread.

362
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,030
你知道是什么意思吗?
What do you think that means?

363
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,370
我真不知道
I really don't know.

364
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,300
我给你点提示吧
I'll give you a little clue.

365
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,400
我最爱的三明治?
My favorite sandwich?

366
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,830
黑面包加色拉米香肠[意大利蒜味香肠]
Salami on pumpernickel.

367
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
就这样?
Is that so?

368
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,500
你知道黑面包这个词吗?
And did you know the word "pumpernickel"

369
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,700
是从德语的抽水机和分币两个词演变来的
Comes from the german words "pumper" and "nickel,"

370
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,200
一不小心就会理解成放屁的小妖精了
Which loosely translates to "fart goblin"?

371
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,230
不  我不知道
No. I didn't.

372
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,800
好吧  我找到盒子了  接下来?
Okay, I found the box. now what?

373
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,520
你正拿着一个日本迷箱
You're holding a japanese puzzle box,

374
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,470
要打开它必须采取十个精确步骤
Which takes ten precise moves to open.

375
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:37,870
首先
First,

376
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,020
找到有钻石图案的镶板
Locate the panel with the diamond pattern and

377
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,730
然后将中间部分往左滑一毫米
Slide the center portion one millimeter to the left.

378
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,310
接着  在盒子的反面
Then, on the opposite end of the box,

379
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,530
将整个镶板往下推2毫米
Slide the entire panel down two millimeters.

380
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,300
你会听到一下轻轻的咔哒声
You'll hear a slight click.

381
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,130
等下  谢尔顿  你对这个盒子有什么情结吗?
Hang on. sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?

382
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
不  在网上买的便宜新奇货而已
No, it's a novelty I ordered off the internet.

383
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,700
你听到咔哒声了吗?
Did you hear the click?

384
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,770
还没
Not yet.

385
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,630
听到了
There it is.

386
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,660
好吧  换个话题
Okay, here's another one.

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,040
如果你嫁给了著名摇滚吉他手强尼·温特
If you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter,

388
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,030
你的名字就冬夏皆有了
You'd be summer winter.

389
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,490
-唔唔  -是啊
Uh-huh. yep.

390
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,930
我这么拼死拼活就是想说  我喜欢你
Okay, I'm going to just go for broke here and say I like you.

391
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,760
是吗?
Yeah?

392
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,040
老实说  你觉得有什么话题
Do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from

393
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,610
能改善下我们目前的窘况
Where we are right now to a place

394
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,760
以便你能答应我约你出去呢?
Where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?

395
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,530
没有
No.

396
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,830
很好
Fair enough.

397
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,090
我不会烦你了
I'll leave you in peace.

398
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
感激不尽
Thank you.

399
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,390
但我走之前
But before I go,

400
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,110
你介意我们拍张合照吗?
Would you mind if I just take one

401
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,830
我要贴在我的Fackbook上
Picture of us together for my facebook page?

402
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,460
当然不了
Sure.

403
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,160
好了  太棒了
Okay. great.

404
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,830
那个  我能拍张让我们看起来像在热吻吗?
Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?

405
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:21,090
好吧  现在你要把优盘插进USB接口...
Okay, now you're going to insert the flash drive into the usb port...

406
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,140
她之所以叫我小甜派
She calls me moon pie because I'm

407
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,090
是因为我看起来很可口  她想要一口吃掉
Nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up.

408
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,660
现在  拜托你快把优盘插进USB接口
Now, please put the flash drive in the usb port.

409
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,960
就是那个看起来像小鸭子嘴的东西
The one that looks like a little duck's mouth.

410
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,960
进展如何?
Hey, how'd it go?

411
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,360
终结者毁了我的手机
Terminator broke my phone.

412
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,160
失陪
Excuse me.

413
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,090
让我开诚布公吧
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

414
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,590
我花了两小时构思了各种搭讪方案
I've just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head,

415
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,230
就为了能给你留下个好印象
Trying to come up with some clever line to say to you.

416
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,460
但我最终意识到  我们都是人类
But then I finally realized you're a human being; I'm a human being.

417
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,790
我只要对你说...
I could just say to you...

418
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,060
下一站  圣巴巴拉市
Santa barbara.

419
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,460
抱歉  我要下车了
I'm sorry. this is me.

420
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,030
你好  我叫莱纳德
Hi, my name's leonard.

421
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,120
我是这样想的  你三年前获得诺贝尔奖
So, I'm thinking, you won the nobel prize what, three years ago?

422
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,520
你一定很烦  关于你近来有什么成就的言论
So you must deal with a whole lot of "what has smoot done lately?"

423
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,270
所以我们可以合作继续我的研究
My thought is we continue my research as a team-- you know, cooper-smoot,

424
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,860
按字幕顺序  可以起名叫库珀-斯穆特
you know, cooper-smoot, alphabetical--

425
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,620
我们就能赢得诺贝尔奖  你又重新登顶
and when we win the nobel prize, you'll be back on top.

426
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,950
尊敬的库珀博士  你疯了吗?
With all due respect, dr. cooper, are you on crack?

427
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,250
那就叫斯穆特-库珀好了!
Fine! smoot-cooper.
