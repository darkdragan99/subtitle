1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,320
好了  灭了
Okay, it's done.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,530
伙计们
Look, guys, for the future,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,270
我不介意以后帮你们灭大蜘蛛
I don't mind killing the big spiders,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,480
但那么小的不用我出手吧
But you have to at least try with the little ones.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,740
佩妮  拜托
Penny, please.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,470
我们面对的问题可比蜘蛛纲动物严峻得多
We're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,840
谢尔顿  没那么严重
Sheldon, it's not so bad.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,210
不严重  简直是毛骨悚然
Not bad? it's horrible.

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,380
你觉得像听故事一样
I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing,

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,910
以为不会发生在你身上
But you never think it'll happen to you.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,010
他们不就是把你的饺子蒸了一下嘛
So they steamed your dumplings.

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,290
算了吧
Get over it.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,510
拜托  换个新话题
New topic, please.

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,900
好吧  佩妮
All right, penny.

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,770
我借这个机会向你表达
Let me take this opportunity to point out

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,360
你今天看起来相当令人销魂
That you are looking particularly ravishing today.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,730
霍华德  一千个套套都别想
Not with a thousand condoms, howard.

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,900
这么说还真有个数量
So, there is a number.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,230
拜托  换个新话题
Okay, new topic, please.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,530
你们知道楼上5A的人要搬出去吗
Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out?

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,060
-别说  嘘  -虾米
- No, shh-shh-shh! - what?!

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,100
楼上的人要搬了
The people upstairs are moving out.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,700
别说
No!

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,160
恐怖至极
The horror...

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,330
你干嘛非要提这事呢
Why would you just say something like that?

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,160
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

27
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,400
那我还能怎么说
How else was I supposed to say it?

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,290
慢一点  就像放一条新买的鱼进鱼缸
Slowly. like putting a new fish in a tank.

29
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,060
不能直接丢进去
You don't just drop it in.

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,300
要连鱼带袋子先放进去一段时间
You let the bag sit in the water a while.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,060
恐怖至极
The horror...

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,000
谢尔顿  我保证不会有事的
Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.

33
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,700
不可能会好了
No, it's not going to be fine.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,830
改变总是不好的
Change is never fine.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,260
人们说改变是好事  事实才不是
They say it is, but it's not.

36
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,330
亲爱的  你认识那些要搬的人吗
Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,830
我从没见过他们
I never met them.

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,500
这样他们才完美
That's what made them perfect.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,730
不用尴尬地在楼道打招呼
There were no awkward "hellos" in the halls.

40
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,200
不会有高跟鞋踩在木质地板的咔咔声
There's no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

41
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,380
这一家就像是一窝小猫
They may as well have been a family of

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,960
从这个窗帘跳到那个窗帘
Cats just jumping around from drape to drape.

43
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,530
但没有尿液中恼人的氨味
Without that annoying ammonia urine smell.

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,160
我保证新来的也会安安静静的
Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.

45
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,630
你怎么知道
You can't know that.

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
你怎么可能知道
How can you possibly know that?

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,930
对  我不知道  告诉你
You're right, I can't. you know what?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,730
任何人都可能租那个房
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

49
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,960
歌剧歌手啦 跺脚舞演员啦
an opera singer, the cast of stomp...

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,130
有条木腿的踢踏舞海盗啦
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.

51
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,760
你干嘛要越搞越糟
Why are you making it worse?

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,300
我想搞好点  他不干而已
I tried making it better. he wouldn't go for it.

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
对啊  真是好主意
You're right! that's a great idea.

54
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,260
-什么  -我去租那个房
- What? - I'll take the apartment upstairs.

55
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,500
我就能摆脱我妈
I can finally get away from my mother

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,200
我们也有更多时间聚聚
And we can all spend some more time together.

57
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,730
明白我的用意吧
If you catch my drift.

58
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,300
恐怖至极
The horror...

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,750
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第19集

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,660
等等 你真以为我会相信
Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe

61
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,370
社交礼仪规定
that social protocol dictates we

62
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,260
我们不惜弄伤腰骨帮沃罗威茨搬家
Break our backs helplping wolowitz move,

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,270
而他只要给我们买份匹萨吗
and then he only need buy us a pizza?

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,620
抱歉  事实就是这样
I'm sorry, that really is how it works.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,550
你骗我
You' tricking me.

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,550
说实话  好处到底是什么
You tell me the truth, what do we get?

67
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,350
拉杰  搭救我吧
Raj, help me out here.

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,480
你能在PS3[索尼游戏机]和山地车中任选其一
You get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3.

69
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,180
我就知道
I knew it!

70
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,820
PS3  肯定选PS3
Ps3, definitely ps3.

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,520
有谁会选山地车
Who would pick a mountain bike?

72
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,520
别再自责了  妈
Enough with the guilt, ma.

73
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,050
我们还会见面
We'll still see each other.

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,020
我每天晚上回来和你吃饭
I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,320
你会才怪呢
The hell you will!

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,750
我这成什么了  星级餐馆吗
What am I running here, a fancy restaurant?

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,280
这里像橄榄园餐厅吗
Does this look like olive garden?!

78
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,450
我知道了  你生气
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,350
你不想让你的小小鸟离巢
You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest.

80
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,820
小小鸟
"little bird"?

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
你都快30了
You're almost 30!

82
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,350
看在上帝的份上  快飞吧
Fly, for god's sake!

83
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,050
行  我不走了
Fine, I'll stay!

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,180
高兴了吧  疯婆子
Ya happy, crazy lady?

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,390
肯定高兴死了
I sure as hell hope so,

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,220
因为你就是要毁掉我的生活
because you're ruining my life!

87
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,820
佩妮  我是莱纳德
Hey, penny? it's leonard.

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,020
好消息  你不用把头放进烤箱了
Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,880
看来也不用戴这个了
I guess I won't be needing this.

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,650
苍天啊
Oh, no...

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,150
新来滴
The new ones.

92
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,120
他们来了
They're here.

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
冷静点  我们还不了解他们呢
Stay calm. we don't know anything about them yet.

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,780
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

95
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,050
我查查有没有乐器
I'm checking for musical instruments.

96
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,950
像不像响板的声音
Does that sound like castanets to you?

97
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,750
盒子上写着厨房呢
The box says "kitchen."

98
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,840
那又怎样
So?

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,580
毒贩会在盒子上写可卡因么
do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box?

100
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,320
你们好
Hello?

101
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,080
-你好  -你好
Hello. hello.

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,450
-你好  -你好  -你好
Hello. hello. hello.

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,420
我叫艾丽西娅
I'm Alicia.

104
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,650
我搬来楼上住
I'm moving in upstairs.

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,650
那真是太好了
That is so great.

106
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,250
我叫莱纳德
Oh, I'm leonard.

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,550
我住下面
I live downstairs.

108
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,550
在这层的楼上  不过还是在你下面啦
Upstairs from here, but under you.

109
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,280
不是在你人下面  是你楼下
Not under you per se, but under your apartment.

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,180
挺好
That's nice.

111
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,420
是啊 挺好
Yeah, it is.

112
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,450
你的举动表明你有和她交配的冲动
If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate...

113
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,520
你好
Hello.

114
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,620
你好
Hello.

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
你好
Hello.

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,030
从一到十打分
On a scale of one to ten

117
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,350
你怎么给自己打分呢
How light of foot would you describe yourself

118
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,860
一表示一点也不像猫
With one being not cat-like at al

119
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,920
十表示你是猫中之猫
And ten being freakishly feline?

120
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,820
猫中之猫？
"freakishly feline"?

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,950
这是你给出的答案还是你没有理解问题
Is that your answer or do you not understand the question?

122
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,120
先不说这个
We'll come back to that one.

123
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,320
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

124
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,880
等一下
Hang on.

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,460
你目前抑或过去有没有跳过萨尔萨舞
Are you now or have you ever been a salsa

126
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,050
爱尔兰民族舞或者霹雳舞
Irish folk or break-dancer?

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,750
没
No.

128
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,120
你弄得别人不舒服了
You're making her uncomfortable.

129
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,580
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

130
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,680
到现在为止你表现很不错
Well, if it helps you feel any better

131
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,720
希望能让你感觉好点
you're doing very well so far.

132
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,680
下个问题  你有生育能力吗
Next question，are you fertile?

133
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,220
什么
What?!

134
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,860
我在判定婴儿在我头上
I'm trying to determine whether crying

135
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,580
哭哭啼啼的可能性
Infants above my head are a possibility.

136
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,020
我现在没这个打算
I have no immediate plans.

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,920
改变主意的话  记得告诉我
If that changes, let me know.

138
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,620
最后一个问题  铺小地毯  赞成还是反对
And finally, area rugs, pro or con?

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,250
-赞成  -艾丽西娅
Pro? alicia?

140
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,350
-怎么  -欢迎你入住
Yes? welcome to the building.

141
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,350
莱纳德  太感谢你的帮忙了
Thanks so much for helping me, leonard.

142
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,450
感谢你给我帮忙的机会
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
伙计们
Oh, hey, guys.

144
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,680
佩妮  这是艾丽西娅  我们的新邻居
Hey, penny. this is alicia, our new neighbor.

145
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,420
你好
Hi.

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,420
你好
Hi.

147
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,180
我在帮她忙呢
I'm helping.

148
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,020
看得出来哦
I can see.

149
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,150
艾丽西娅对音乐不感冒  无子女  赞成铺地毯
Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug.

150
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,580
她还在我的考察期内  但我看好她
She's still on probation, of course, but I like her.

151
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,020
T恤很酷啊
Cool t-shirt.

152
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,550
是吗  我一般不这样穿的
Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this.

153
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,750
我去慢跑
I'm going jogging.

154
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,680
你好像从不慢跑吧
You don't jog.

155
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,620
现在开始
I can start.

156
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
行
True

157
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,830
但是对于你的穿着  更可信的解释是
But the more likely explanation for your

158
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,280
你又没干净衣服换了
Attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.

159
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,120
谢尔顿  我谢谢你
Thank you, sheldon.

160
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,750
佩妮  不客气
You're welcome, penny.

161
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,080
没事  你看起来很可爱
Please, you look cute.

162
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,180
瞧  我今天也穿得邋里邋遢的
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

163
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,150
我觉得很惊艳啊
I think you look fantastic.

164
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,620
他挺会演戏吧
This one's a player, huh?

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,020
是啊  你要小心哦
Oh, yeah, be careful.

166
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,750
谢谢提醒
Thanks for the warning. okay.

167
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,020
-过会儿见  -拜拜
-I'll see you around. -see ya.

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,720
瞧  我今天也穿得邋里邋遢的
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

169
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,680
鹦鹉学舌啊
Oh, mimicry.

170
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,220
我喜欢玩鹦鹉学舌
I enjoy mimicry.

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,250
我模仿过星战第六部的阿克巴上将
I've been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi.

172
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
"这是个圈套"
"it's a trap."

173
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,850
你得把我想象成一个大乌贼脑袋
You have to imagine me with a giant squid head.

174
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
"这是个圈套"
"it's a trap."

175
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,050
"这是个圈套"
"it's a trap."

176
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,020
"这是个圈套"
"it's a trap."

177
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,650
请进
Come.

178
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,550
祝贺一下  你终于洗衣服了
Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.

179
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,080
-这个  算是吧  -什么叫算是吧
-Well, sort of. -how does one "sort of..."

180
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,180
我买了新衣服  行了吧
I bought new clothes, okay?

181
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,950
莱纳德在不在
Is leonard around?

182
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,550
他在楼上跟艾丽西娅一起
He's upstairs at Alicia's.

183
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,180
好吧  行  没啥
Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie.

184
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,720
他答应过帮我装打印机  再等一会吧
He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait.

185
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,250
他到底在楼上干什么呢
What exactly is he doing up there?

186
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,820
我认为是旨在毁灭我而进行的战略行动
In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me,

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,380
他跟库萨帕里和沃罗威茨在帮她装音响
He is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo.

188
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,720
他们都在楼上 是吗
Oh, they're all up there, huh?

189
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,920
正常
Hmm, typical.

190
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,250
这很明显不正常
It's axiomatically atypical.

191
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
到现在为止  他们不了解艾丽西娅
Up until recently, they did not know alicia,

192
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,720
也没有在其他地方相处过
And had no encounters with her in a previous location.

193
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,830
以前他们从不上楼拜访房客
They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants,

194
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,080
而你将他们的行为鉴定为正常
So your characterization of their behavior as "typical"

195
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,780
是绝对的谬误
Is demonstrably fallacious.

196
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
好了  现在我看到一颗大乌贼脑袋了
Okay, now I see the giant squid head.

197
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,350
这下好  我又得重新来一遍
Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,050
我是想过租这房子
Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment,

199
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,910
不过我更像那种城里
But I'm really more of a

200
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,780
住跃层的黄金单身汉
"downtown loft" kind of guy.

201
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,780
不错啊  你现在住跃层吗
Cool. so are you in a loft now?

202
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,450
事实上
Oh, actually,

203
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,720
我现在阿塔迪纳那里和一个女人同居
I'm, uh, living with a woman in altadena.

204
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,350
不过是纯柏拉图式的  她同时是我的女佣
Purely platonic. she's also my maid.

205
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,150
听起来蛮不错的
Sounds like a sweet deal.

206
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,650
不过说实话  她差你太远了
I won't lie. it's pretty dope.

207
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,220
有人吗
Hello?

208
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,150
我过来给你带了些欢迎礼物
Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.

209
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,750
那真是太好了
That is so sweet.

210
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,880
进来  我们打开看看吧
Come on in. let's open it. great.

211
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,150
你这裙子不错
Nice dress.

212
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
哪里哪里  我今天穿得邋里邋遢的
Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.

213
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,250
他们正在帮我设功放
The guys have been helping me set up my sound system.

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,950
他们真是我有过最帅的技术帮手了
I've never had such good-looking technical support.

215
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,750
哪里哪里
Oh, pish-posh.

216
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,950
我怎么知道  它意思是不值一提
I don't know, it means shucks.

217
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,520
不值一提就是不值一提的意思
"shucks" means shucks.

218
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,620
你就不能等等再说这个
Let one go once in a while.

219
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,950
-对了佩妮  你知道还有什么奇事吗  -什么
-Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?  -Yeah.

220
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,220
艾丽西娅跟你一样也是个演员
Alicia is an actress, just like you.

221
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,380
太棒了
That is so awesome.

222
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,480
想是这样想  但也没那么容易
Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.

223
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,850
是啊  跟我说说关于你的事
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

224
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,210
我在这里待了足足三个月
I've been out here three months,

225
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,260
结果只搞到几个全国广告
And all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials

226
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,320
还有肥皂剧的小客串
And this recurring thing on a soap.

227
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,780
所以我现在还在蛋糕店工作
That's why I work at the cheesecake factory.

228
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,750
我感觉那些角色都不适合我
I'm holding out for the right part.

229
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,690
艾丽西娅  你DVD想怎么设啊
Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for dvds

230
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,520
5.1杜比还是家庭影院
5.1 dolby or dts?

231
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,150
你看着办好了  小可爱
Whatever you think is best, cutie.

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,020
家庭影院的低音更好  那就...
Well, dts has more low end, so...

233
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,320
好的
Okay.

234
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,150
对了各位  你们绝对会喜欢这个的
Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this.

235
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,020
我刚在网上读了个超赞的科学笑话
I read the best science joke on the internet.

236
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,250
艾丽西娅  你不懂的  但是他们很喜欢这个
Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley.

237
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,690
就是 从前有个物理学家
Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlor

238
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,570
每周都去冰淇淋店点两个圣代
every week and orders an ice

239
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,830
一个自己吃
Cream sundae for himself, and then offers one

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,980
一个放在旁边的空座位
To the empty stool sitting next to him.

241
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,020
好久都是这样 直到店主好奇问他为什么
This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing.

242
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,050
他说  因为我是物理学家
The man says, "well, I'm a physicist,

243
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,590
而量子物理理论 告诉我们总有几率
and quantum mechanics... Teaches us "that it is possible

244
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,600
这张空座位上面 的物质会变成一个
For the matter above this stool "to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman

245
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,480
可能爱上我的MM
Who might accept my offer and fall in love with me."

246
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,250
店主然后说   这里每天
The owner then says, "well, lots of single,

247
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,920
都有大队单身MM
"beautiful women come in here ever day.

248
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,050
你干嘛不买冰淇淋泡她们
"why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them,

249
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,820
让她们爱上你
And they might fall in love with you?"

250
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,020
物理学家说  那个发生的几率又可能有多大呢
And the physicist says, "yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?"

251
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,520
这有点侮辱人  你不觉得吗
It's a little insulting, don't you think?

252
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,820
怎么会知道
How would I know?

253
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
我自己都不理解这有什么好笑的
I'm not even sure I get it.

254
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,550
对了  莱纳德
Hey, leonard?

255
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,420
你装好那个DVD以后
If you're done with the dvd player,

256
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,220
能不能再帮我装这个打印机
can you set up my printer?

257
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
乐意为您效劳
Uh, yeah, I'd love to.

258
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,560
等你装好她的
Uh, hey, maybe when you're done with her printer,

259
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,080
来装我的吧
You could set up mine.

260
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,580
你知道  你答应的...在一周前
You know, like you promised... a week ago.

261
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,580
好的  我会来的  先别烦我
Yeah, I'll get to it-- don't nag me.

262
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,400
好啊  美女
Hello there

263
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,530
是谁啊
Who is it?

264
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,530
你好  佩妮 门是开的  请进
Oh hello, penny. It's open-- come in.

265
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,560
这就叫讽刺
Sarcasm.

266
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,500
他们还都泡在楼上呢
Well, they're all still up there.

267
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,200
你以为我没听见吗
You think I can't hear them?

268
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,530
听听啊  呯呯呯
Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

269
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
那是沃罗威茨踩他那个高跟皮鞋  没错的
That's wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.

270
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,200
我不知道我为什么会介意呢
I don't even know why I care.

271
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,330
我才不介意
I don't care.

272
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,500
好吧  我介意得去背那个白痴笑话 但是我只介意到那个程度
All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.

273
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,930
你知道吗  佩妮 蜂窝实际上
You know, penny, there's something that

274
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,260
很有趣的
Occurs in beehives you might find interesting.

275
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,170
有时候
Occasionally,

276
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,660
新的蜂王会在老蜂王还在位时闯进来
A new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power.

277
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,090
此时
When this happens,

278
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,090
老蜂王要不另谋出路
The old queen must either locate to a new hive or

279
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,160
要不就去拼个你死我活
Engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.

280
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,100
你说什么呢  我被艾丽西娅威胁了?
What are you saying, that I'm threatened by alicia?

281
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,630
难道你说我是那个老蜂王 现在该滚蛋了
That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?

282
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,400
我只是在说蜜蜂
I'm just talking about bees.

283
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,460
探索频道在播这个
They're on the discovery channel.

284
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,960
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

285
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,560
蜜蜂
Bees.

286
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,000
我理解那个物理学家笑话了
I just got that physicist joke.

287
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,230
佩妮  谢谢你给我们买晚饭
Gee, penny, thanks for buying us dinner.

288
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
是啊  今天怎么了
Yeah, what's the occasion?

289
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,660
没什么  只是感觉应该
No, no occasion-- just felt like getting

290
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,760
给我的好朋友带点中国菜
some chinese chow for my peeps.

291
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,200
你记得我叫你点的鸡里面
Did you remember to ask for the chicken

292
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,590
莴苣要切块
With broccoli to be diced,

293
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,430
-不要切丝  -记得

299
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,060
不错
Good.

300
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,130
看看别人怎么做的  莱纳德
See how it's done, leonard?

301
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,900
我们今天晚上玩点啥
So, what do we got going on tonight, huh?

302

玩光晕  看太空堡垒  还是把曼妥思丢到可乐里?
Playing halo watching battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?

303
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,760
你想看太空堡垒?
You want to watch battlestar?

304
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,430
我还能说什么呢?  我不可救药地爱上了它
What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.

305
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,730
不  经前综合症的表现和这个不同
No, no, pms is different.

306
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,100
-谢天谢地你在家  我需要帮助  -怎么了
Oh, thank god you're home. I need help. what's wrong?

307
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,740
我接到电话让我去试镜
I just got a callback to audition

308
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,760
在<犯罪现场>里演一个被杀了的妓女
For csi to play a hooker who gets killed.

309
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,830
那我一定要看
Oh, I'd watch that.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,140
但我的车还在修
But my car is in the shop,

311
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,000
我得在45分钟内赶到环球影城
And I have to be at universal in 45 minutes.

312
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,230
没问题  我带你去
Okay, well, I'll take you.

313
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,330
你真是及时雨
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

314
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,630
我可以在车上帮你对台词
I'll run lines with you in the car.

315
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,760
太好了
Great.

316
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,600
完事之后我带你们去吃中餐
And afterward, I'll take you all out for chinese.

317
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,260
实际上  不用担心  我们已经...
Oh, actually, that's okay. we already have...

318
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,660
嗯  饿死啦
Yum. starving.

319
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
在这儿吃中餐了
...chinese food right here.

320
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,800
他们已经走了  佩妮 听不到你说什么了
They're gone, penny. They can't hear you.

321
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,880
真不敢相信他们就这样任她利用
I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that.

322
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,300
她一句话就让他们 像看家狗一样跟在后面
I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs.

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,530
你知道就在上个星期
You know that just last week,

324
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,210
她让霍华德大老远开车带她
She had howard drive all the way to her

325
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,360
去橘子郡的叔叔家里取她的电视
Uncle's house in orange county to pick up her tv?

326
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,000
你曾让我和莱纳德帮你 从前男友那里要电视回来
You once had leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.

327
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,660
性质不同  谢尔顿
Apples and oranges here, sheldon.

328
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,250
这个女孩利用他们 靠脸蛋儿过着舒服日子
That girl is a user iceskating through the life on her looks,

329
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,070
占那些单纯的
Taking advantage of innocent,

330
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,100
意志力薄弱的男人便宜  去弱智电视剧试镜
Weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows.

331
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
现在还在我的地盘撒野
It just creams my corn.

332
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,000
-我能打断一下么?  -说吧!
May I interject something here? please.

333
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,830
你拿错芥末了
You got the wrong mustard.

334
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,380
你猜怎么着?  我拿到<犯罪现场>里那个角色了
Guess what? I got the part on csi.

335
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,360
哦  天哪
Oh, boy.

336
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,960
有什么不对劲么?
Something wrong?

337
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,330
不不不不  恭喜你
Uh, no. no, no, no, you know, congratulations.

338
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,330
我觉得你会是个出色的妓女的
I think you'll make a great hooker.

339
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,130
谢谢
Thank you.

340
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,150
我想问个问题
Hey, I got to ask you something.

341
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,520
物理学家挣多少钱啊
How much do physicists make?

342
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,660
不清楚 不会太多吧
Um, I don't know. I don't think a lot.

343
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,500
我想也是
Yeah, that's what I figured.

344
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,030
我闪人了
Well, got to run.

345
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,570
他们答应帮我装电视天线
The guys promised to set up my satellite dish

346
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,160
还有粉刷卧室
And paint my bedroom. yay!

347
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,330
我能说两句么
Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?

348
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
说什么
About what?

349
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,590
我想说  莱纳德  霍华德和拉杰
Well, you know, it's just that leonard and howard and raj,

350
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,660
他们不像一般的男生
They aren't like other guys.

351
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,530
他们很特别
They're special.

352
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,660
是很特别  那又怎样
Okay, they're special... and?

353
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,200
怎么说好呢
Oh, let's see. how can I explain this?

354
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,600
他们不会用保护层
Um, they don't know how to use their shields.

355
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,960
保护层?
Shields?

356
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,370
就像在星际迷航里
Yeah, you know, like in star trek,

357
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,400
作战的时候你会架设保护层
When you're in battle and you raise the shields?

358
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,530
老天这句话是怎么溜出来的
Where the hell'd that come from?

359
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,630
总之  你知道这样的男生很容易...
Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so...

360
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,130
请不要利用他们
Please don't take advantage of them.

361
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,430
谁说我利用他们了
Who says I'm taking advantage of them?

362
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,720
拜托  他们为你忙来忙去
Come on. they're doing everytng for you,

363
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,100
还不是你招惹他们
Because you're leading them on.

364
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
我让他们帮我的忙
So I let them do stuff for me.

365
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,900
他们高兴  我受益
They're happy. I get stuff.

366
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,160
有什么不好
Who cares?

367
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,030
和你所做的有什么不同
And how's it any different from what you do?

368
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,600
你说什么
Excuse me?

369
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,100
我看你也老围着他们
I've seen you around them.

370
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,560
好像你没做过同样的事
Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?

371
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,130
姐姐  你过了啊
Okay, lady, you are way out of line.

372
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,930
到底谁过了?
Oh, I'm out of line?

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,930
对  你过了
Yeah, you're out of line.

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,530
你想怎么着
Well, what are you going to do about it...

375
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,160
婊子
Bitch?

376
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,230
我喜欢绿灯侠
I like green lantern.

377
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,250
我是说  他会被黄灯击倒
I'm just saying it's pretty lame that

378
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,360
真是太逊了
He can be defeated by the color yellow.

379
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,830
只有现代绿灯侠才怕黄灯
Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.

380
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
黄金年代绿灯侠怕的是木头
Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.

381
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,660
不错  我用一支2B铅笔就能把他们两个都解决了
Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?

382
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,230
天啊  女人打架!
Oh, my god! girl fight!

383
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,560
你干什么
What are you doing?!

384
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,200
我知道你肯定傻到想去劝架
I know you. you're stupid enough to break it up.

385
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,470
容我说一句  你今晚很清秀嘛
May I say you look very comely tonight?

386
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,140
谢谢
Thank you.

387
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,600
你说的没错  这匹小母马瘸了
You're right, this filly's been broken.

388
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,140
你帮她设置了家庭影院对吧
you set it on dts, didn't you?

389
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,500
没办法
I had to.

390
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,600
她叫人家小可爱嘛
She called me "cutie."

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,170
从艾丽西娅的个人主页看来
According to alicia's facebook page,

392
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,400
她搞上了一个CSI的制片
She's hooking up with one of the producers on csi.

393
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,440
电视上演死妓女  生活中是活妓女
Well, dead whore on tv, live one in real life.

394
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,600
很好
Oh, great.

395
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,440
她现在开始玩蹦床了
Now she's jumping up and down on the bed.
