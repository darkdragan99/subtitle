1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,540
你是星战银河系里的吗
Okay. Are you from the Star Wars universe?

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,710
是
Yes.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,080
是原始三部曲里的吗
Were you in the original trilogy?

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,800
是
Yes.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,970
是不是我钱包里 夹着一张你穿金属比基尼的照片
Oh, is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,870
老天  我可不希望如此
God, I hope not.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,870
不对  不是莱娅公主
And no, I'm not Princess Leia.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,400
轮到我了
Okay, okay. My turn. Um...

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,770
六部星战电影都有你吗
Are you in all six Star Wars movies?

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,370
-对  -有意思
- Yes. - Interesting.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,800
你是机器人吗
Are you a droid?

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,840
是
Yes.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,740
是不是有点像闪闪亮的谢尔顿
Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,900
是
Yes.

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,300
C-3PO
C-3PO.

16
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,540
猜对了
You got it.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,140
太荒谬了
That's preposterous.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
我才不像C-3PO呢
I do not resemble C-3PO.

19
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,400
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,170
虽然受宠若惊  但我不这么认为
I'm flattered. I just don't see it.

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,170
[手机铃声:她用科学迷了我的眼]

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,540
是莱斯利·温克尔
Leslie Winkle.

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
接通"互利友人"
You've reached "Friends with Benefits."

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,840
性爱电招  请按一
For a booty call, press one now.

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,800
什么叫做
What exactly does that expression mean,

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,370
"互利友人"
"friends with benefits"?

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,970
他给她提供健康保障了?
Does he provide her with health insurance?

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,300
不是
No.

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,510
想象你和某人 保持性交关系
Imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with,

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,870
但同时能和任何人约会
but you were free to date whoever you wanted.

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,310
抱歉  我想不出任何一个
I'm sorry. I can't imagine any of that.

32
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,370
还是玩游戏吧
All right. Back to the game.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,130
应该轮到我了
I believe it's my turn.

34
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,540
你们随时可以提问了
You may begin your questions whenever you're ready.

35
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,510
你是斯波克吧[星战人物]
Are you Spock?

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,710
我不喜欢这个游戏
I don't like this game.

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,640
轮到谁了
So, where were we?

38
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,140
你不是应招去做爱吗
Aren't you leaving for your booty call?

39
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,140
不是  是其他事
No, it was something else.

40
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,710
怎么什么事都要和性爱挂钩  拜托
Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on.

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,310
轮到谁了
Whose turn is it?

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,160
到你了
We were up to you.

43
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,630
好  开始吧
Great. Just start.

44
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,580
好
Okay, let's see.

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,810
你是连续剧里的吗
Are you from a TV series?

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
她把我甩了
She dumped me!

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,310
我看他是《巴比伦5号》的
I bet he's someone from Babylon 5.

48
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,210
我们猜不中了
We're never going to get it.

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,480
《生活大爆炸》
第二季  第21集

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,280
莱斯利怎么了  为什么甩你
What happened with Leslie? Why did she dump you?

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,980
我不知道  她就说
I don't know. She just said,

52
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,050
霍华德  老娘见异思迁了
"Howard, Mama's a rolling stone."

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,680
然后电话哔了一声就挂了
Then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,780
我不明白
I don't understand.

55
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,550
如果你们之间没有感情
If you were in a non-emotional relationship, then why

56
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,850
怎么情绪反应得这么波动
are you having what appears to be an emotional response?

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,980
谢尔顿  他显然对她有感情
Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.

58
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,920
我当然对她有感情
Of course I had feelings for her.

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,150
我看了她的裸体呢  老天
I saw her naked, for God's sake.

60
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,880
你要转移一下注意力
Okay, look, you just need to get your mind off it.

61
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,720
想不想去漫画书店
Do you want to go to the comic book store?

62
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,820
或者看部电影
Maybe go see a movie?

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,020
我哪也不想去
I don't want to go anywhere.

64
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,350
我发现内华达州有一大堆
I'm given to understand that there's an entire city in Nevada

65
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,820
特别设计的城市能帮霍华德这类人
designed specifically to help people like Howard

66
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,220
忘却他们的烦恼
forget their problems.

67
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,950
直接用新烦恼替代
They can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism,

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,550
比如酗酒  赌博  性传播疾病
gambling addiction, and sexually transmitted diseases.

69
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,550
是我想错了  还是谢尔顿在说去维加斯
Is it me, or was that Sheldon's way of saying, "Vegas, baby!"?

70
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,420
我没去过那儿  你呢
I've never been there. Have you?

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,920
我也没有
Me? No.

72
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,520
我引用文森·沃恩在《摇摆者》里的话而已
I just got "Vegas, baby!" from Vince Vaughn in Swingers.

73
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,920
应该不错啊  反正现在周末也空下来了
It could be fun. I know my weekend's wide open, now that...

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,150
就这么办  我们去维加斯吧
Okay, let's do this. Let's go to Las Vegas.

75
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,820
-现在就去吗  -何乐而不为呢
- Now? Right now? - Why not?

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,580
大家都做即兴的事
People do things "right now," all the time.

77
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,420
我们也即兴一把
Why can't we be "right now" people, too?

78
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,350
回家收拾行李  我们就是即兴一族了
Go home, pack a bag, and we'll be "right now" people.

79
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,580
但是 我得先去药店买药
I mean, I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription,

80
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,080
买完药  我们就即兴去
but after that, we'll go right now.

81
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,580
你意下如何  霍华德
What do you say, Howard?

82
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,480
我觉得
I say...

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,250
去维加斯吧
"Vegas, baby!"

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,020
你怎么跟你妈说
What are you going to tell your mother?

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,380
我去海洋世界
"Sea World, baby!"

86
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,820
谢尔顿  你去吗
Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,180
即使让丽蝇在我耳道里
I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs

88
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,680
产卵孵幼虫  我也不去
and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.

89
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,450
行  我们会给你带T恤
Great. We'll bring you back a t-shirt.

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,450
谢谢
Thank you.

91
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,420
你好啊  邻居
Hello, neighbor.

92
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,750
你好  谢尔顿
Hello, Sheldon.

93
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,450
这个美好的夜晚过得愉快么
And how are you this fine evening?

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,750
愉快
Great.

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,450
很好  真高兴
Good. I'm glad.

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
是吗
Really?

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,580
你喝醉了?
Are you drunk?

98
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,520
我就是心情好嘛
I'm just in a good mood.

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,720
我的同胞们都去维加斯了
While my compatriots are in Las Vegas,

100
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,120
我就能在这美好的夜晚 独自享受《孤独要塞》了
I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.

101
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,820
你指的是超人的那个大冰冻那啥对吧
That's Superman's big ice thingy, right?

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
我现在心情好
You know, I'm in such a good mood,

103
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,580
居然觉得你对英语词汇掌握之贫乏
I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp

104
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,120
甚至有一点可爱的说
of the English language folksy and charming today.

105
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,320
什么闻着这么香
Mmm. What smells so good?

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,620
这是奶油咖喱的醉人香气
That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer,

107
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,450
更是对这个自由的傍晚
a perfect culinary representation

108
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,980
通过美食的完美体现
of the freedom this evening holds.

109
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,350
这不光是库萨帕里所厌恶的印度美食
Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes,

110
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,480
并且有大量花生作为配菜
it contains a generous helping of peanuts,

111
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,620
能把沃罗威茨变成一个97磅的呼哧呼哧的大泡泡
which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97-pound blister.

112
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,450
还有  主料是干酪  一种农家芝士
And finally, its main ingredient is paneer, a farmer's cheese

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,950
莱纳德食用后会瞬间让同房间的人
that would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
死不见血
within minutes.

115
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,180
好吃啊
Yum.

116
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,480
那就祝你晚上玩得开心
Well, enjoy your big evening.

117
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,680
佩妮
Penny.

118
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,720
我知道你今晚也是一个人
I realize you're also on your own tonight,

119
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,280
如果你万一觉得一个人无聊了
so if, at some point, you find yourself with nothing to do,

120
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,680
请不要来打扰我
please do not disturb me.

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,480
谢尔顿  玩得开心
Have fun, Sheldon.

122
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,950
当然会了
Oh, I shall.

123
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,050
不要啊
No!

124
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,750
超人同志  您怎么了
What's wrong, Superman?

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,880
被锁在你的大冰冻那啥外面了么
Locked out of your big ice thingy?

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,720
快看
Look at this.

127
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,150
漱口水  润肤露  沐浴液
Mouthwash, lotion, body wash.

128
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,180
洗发水护发素
Shampoo and conditioner

129
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,520
全部在一个小瓶子里
together in one tiny bottle.

130
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,380
我爱拉斯维加斯
I love Las Vegas.

131
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,780
霍华德  能借我你的须后水用用么
Howard, could I borrow some aftershave?

132
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,580
黑色的包里  上面那层
Black case, top compartment.

133
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,980
这么多古龙水
That's a lot of cologne.

134
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,320
第一排是你要的麝香型
First row are your musks. Second is woods,

135
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,650
第二排是木头 皮革和植物味
leathers and botanicals.

136
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,420
第三排是配套的外激素  慎用
Third is assorted pheromones. Tread lightly.

137
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,280
霍华德  精神可嘉
That's the spirit, Howard.

138
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,380
我们能行
Yes, we can.

139
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,650
我们走吧
Come on. Let's go.

140
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,420
你们先去  我还有封邮件要回
You guys go ahead. I just have to finish up an email.

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,280
才不是邮件呢  你在看莱斯利的FACEBOOK主页
That's not an email. That's Leslie's Facebook page.

142
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,450
好吧
Okay, fine.

143
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
我是在看她的主页
I'm checking her Facebook page.

144
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,180
你看她的状态更新了  她说她把我甩了
Look at her status update. She's saying she dumped me.

145
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,820
大家需要知道是我甩了她
People need to know I dumped her.

146
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,320
事实是她甩你啊
But she did dump you.

147
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,280
拉杰  醒醒吧  互联网上无事实
Grow up, Raj. There's no place for truth on the Internet.

148
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,020
你们先去吧  我等下就去找你们
Just go. I'll catch up with you.

149
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,580
好吧
All right.

150
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,750
我们该计划一下  万一我们走桃花运呢
Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,580
如果我走运了  我就带她
Okay, uh, if I get lucky, I'll take her

152
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,620
去我在哥谭城外的古堡[蝙蝠侠居住的城市]
to my stately manner outside Gotham City, and...

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,780
如果你走运了  我就去月亮上睡
if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon.

154
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,650
计划不错
Sounds like a plan.

155
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,120
等着  我记得备用钥匙就放在这附近
Hang on. I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.

156
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,520
我们有个碗
We have a bowl.

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,550
钥匙都放那个碗里
Our keys go in a bowl.

158
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,550
你应该弄个碗
You should get a bowl.

159
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,180
那么请问美丽心灵的谢尔顿·库珀
So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper

160
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,050
是怎么忘带钥匙的
forget his key in the first place?

161
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,250
我把它们落在碗里了
I left them in the bowl.

162
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,480
我想起来备用钥匙在哪了
I just remembered where the emergency key is.

163
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,650
-在哪  -在你们家
- Where? - In your apartment.

164
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,780
怎么在我们家
What's it doing in my apartment?

165
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,850
我几周前去过
Well, I went in there a few weeks ago,

166
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,850
你们不在家  被我落在那了
and you guys weren't home and I forgot it there.

167
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,150
你进了我...为什么
You went in my... Why would...

168
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,580
你说什么呢
What are you saying?

169
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,950
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal. I was making

170
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,150
我泡咖啡的时候没牛奶了
coffee and I ran out of milk.

171
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,920
你就是那个偷奶贼啊
You're the milk thief!

172
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,920
莱纳德说我疯了 但我知道牛奶盒是轻了一些
Leonard said I was crazy, but I knew that carton felt lighter.

173
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,450
好啦  谢尔顿  淡定
All right. Sheldon, look. Just calm down.

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,120
我给公寓管理员打电话  叫他来开门
I will call the building manager and he'll come open your door.

175
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,050
你可以一边等  一边吃饭
You just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,450
吃?  我的晚饭?  在你家?
Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?

177
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,450
是啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why not?

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,820
是啊  怎么了
Sure. Why not?

179
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,450
日落之后  我们再坐着我的小皮卡
And after the sun's down, we can all pile in my pickup

180
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,880
去小溪边裸泳多好
and go skinny-dipping down at the crick.

181
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,880
因为今天是失去理智的日子
Cause today is the day to stop making sense.

182
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,120
谢谢
Thanks.

183
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,520
告诉你  莱纳德  老虎机
I'm telling you, Leonard... video slots...

184
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,550
大胸吧台妹端来的免费饮料
free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid

185
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,250
只要三块九毛五的鲜虾自助
and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95.

186
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,120
迪斯尼一边去吧
Disneyland can suck it.

187
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,480
这里真是人间仙境
This is the real happiest place on earth.

188
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,780
哥们快看
Dude, check it out!

189
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,520
还有整月的洗衣钱
That's laundry for a month!

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,580
你好
Hello.

191
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,250
你叫什么
What's your name?

192
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,920
拉杰·罗摩衍那·库萨帕里
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

193
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,050
你好  拉杰拉杰·罗...
Hello, Rajesh Ra--

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,750
嗨  拉杰
Hi, Rajesh.

195
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,750
我是迈克拉
I'm Michaela.

196
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,950
你好  迈克拉
Hello, Michaela.

197
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,520
你想来个小小的聚会么
So, you interested in a little party?

198
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,580
好啊  我喜欢聚会
Why, yes, I love to party.

199
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,280
聚会是我的中间名
Party is my middle name.

200
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,280
如果不是罗摩衍那的话
Or, it would be if it weren't Ramayan.

201
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,920
拉杰  我能和你说句话么
Uh, Raj, can I... can I talk to you for a moment?

202
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,020
莱纳德  现在不行
Not now, Leonard.

203
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,750
迈克拉邀请我去聚会呢
Michaela's inviting me to a party.

204
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,580
你最好给月亮打个电话
You better call the moon

205
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,550
确认一下他们有没有给你备床
and make sure they have a bed for you.

206
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,680
拜托  我真的有话要跟你说
Yeah. I really need to talk to you.

207
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,380
抱歉  我马上回来
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

208
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,580
不要乱跑哦
Don't go anywhere.

209
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,580
最好连动都不要动  保持造型哦
Don't move. Just stay the beautiful,

210
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,420
你就像一朵未经采摘  娇艳欲滴的美式鲜花
unspoiled American flower that you are.

211
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
伙计  你发什么神经啊
What's wrong with you, dude?

212
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,320
那个女人已经深深地被我的雄性激素吸引了
That woman was all up in my jammy.

213
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,620
好吧  我真的不想打击 你所谓的"雄性激素"
Okay. I hate to break this to you and whatever your "jammy" is,

214
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,380
但我可以肯定她只是个娼妓
but I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.

215
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,820
什么
What?

216
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,820
不能吧
No...

217
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,280
那我换个方式解释吧
Let me put it this way:

218
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,160
在你的一生中  能有几个超级美女
In your entire life, how many gorgeous women

219
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,630
会一进酒吧就过来跟你搭讪
have walked straight up to you in a bar

220
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,520
还问你要不要去参加派对?
and asked if you wanted to party?

221
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,880
或许我可以感化她
Maybe I can save her.

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,020
或许吧  但我猜你可能会为此 付出每小时500美元的代价
Maybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you about $500 an hour to try.

223
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,220
很高兴认识你 祝你的未来更加灿烂美好
It was lovely meeting you. Best of luck in your future endeavors.

224
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,780
随你便
Whatever.

225
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,050
天啊  我已经开始想她了
Oh, I miss her already.

226
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,650
看来霍华德不行了
Oh, Howard's losing it.

227
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,820
他在博客上最新的留言写着
Check out his latest Twitters.

228
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,020
我正处于黑洞的最底端 凝视着绝望的深渊
"I'm at the bottom of a black hole "staring into the abyss.

229
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,220
我的生活毫无意义  我的未来一片茫然
My life is meaningless. My future is without hope."

230
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,060
要不带他去看蓝人乐队吧
Why don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?

231
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,060
你觉得会有用吗
You think that'd help?

232
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,990
"今日美国"称他们为"老少咸宜爆笑组合"
USA Today calls them "exuberant fun for the whole family."

233
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,790
我不知道  霍华德不是那种 通吃老少咸宜乐趣的人
I don't know. Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.

234
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,890
真可惜他没在这  见不到那个妓女
It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker.

235
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,820
她绝对是他喜欢的类型  标准的妓女
She's exactly his type; a hooker.

236
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,360
如果给钱请她帮忙  霍华德一定能振作起来
You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.

237
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,820
我坚决不同意让妓女去安抚沃罗威茨
We're not gonna get Wolowitz a hooker.

238
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,590
我是如此孤独  熊熊的欲火燃烧着我
"I'm so lonely and horny,

239
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,020
我随时会开一瓶20美元的花生酱  然后全部干掉
I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all."

240
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,960
让她报个价  应该不会被打吧
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,460
你今天过得好吗
So how was your day?

242
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,720
你想跟我聊家常吗
Are you trying to make small talk?

243
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,790
亲爱的  你真的不必这么做
Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.

244
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,820
错  这是个惯有的习俗
No, it's the accepted convention.

245
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,320
你今天过得好吗
How was your day?

246
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,890
他们把餐厅的值班表全都打乱了
Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant,

247
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,460
所以我的时间会跟平时有点不一样
so my hours are gonna be a little differe...

248
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,990
抱歉  我对此一点都不感兴趣  快吃吧
I'm sorry. That's not going to interest me at all. Just eat.

249
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,720
你好啊  小姐
Hello again.

250
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,220
你们好啊
Oh, hi.

251
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,720
你好  如果您不忙的话
Yeah, hi. Listen, um... if you're not busy,

252
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,860
我们想知道你是否...
we were thinking maybe you could...

253
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,220
我们其实是想问...
We were wondering...

254
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,990
你到底是不是娼妓
...if you're really a prostitute.

255
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,620
你们是警察吗
You guys cops?

256
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,320
当然不是
No.

257
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,220
那好  我是娼妓
I'm a prostitute.

258
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,490
太好了
Okay, great.

259
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,990
事情是这样的  我们有个朋友
Uh, the thing is, we've got this friend,

260
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,990
他被甩了  很沮丧
and he's kind of down in the dumps.

261
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,320
我们觉得你可以让他振作起来
And we thought maybe you could cheer him up.

262
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,560
用你的床上功夫
With sex.

263
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,920
不用说的这么直白吧
I think she knows what I meant.

264
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,820
你在那兜来兜去她怎么可能明白
How can she when you beat around the bush?

265
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,090
她可是红灯区的
She's from the mean streets

266
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,760
那里的人都是二话不说直接干正事的
where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

267
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,620
放心吧  我会好好照顾你们的朋友
Don't worry. I can take good care of your friend.

268
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,460
好的  太棒了
Okay, terrific.

269
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,420
那请问能不能不让他
Uh, um... listen, is there a way that we can do this

270
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,890
知道你的真实身份是...
where he doesn't know that you're a, you know...

271
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,390
娼妓
Prostitute.

272
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,520
你们想要女友式的服务啊
You want the girlfriend experience.

273
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,290
对  对  正是
Yes. Yeah, exactly.

274
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,090
女友式的服务
The girlfriend experience.

275
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,090
其实  能不能再问一下
Actually, if it's not too much to ask,

276
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,890
能不能搞成犹太人式的女友服务
could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience?

277
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,920
这是第20个问题了
Okay, that's question 20.

278
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,220
你接着猜
You have to guess.

279
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,660
谢尔顿  放过我吧
I don't know, Sheldon.

280
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,060
你是《星球大战》吗
Are you Star Wars?

281
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,460
一个人怎么可能变身成一部电影呢
How can one person be a whole movie?

282
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,820
我放弃了  能不能找点别的事干
Okay, I give up. Can we just do something else?

283
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,290
好吧
Fine.

284
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,820
其实人家是斯波克啦
I was Spock.

285
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,420
你和莱纳德是"互利友人"吗
Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?

286
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,420
什么
What?

287
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,660
你和莱纳德是"互利友人"吗
Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?

288
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,190
这是谁无中生有的
Where did that even come from?

289
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,320
是他说的吗
Did he say we were?

290
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,390
不  莱纳德什么都没说
No, Leonard said nothing.

291
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,260
但他假装说你的信寄错了
But who knows what goes on over here

292
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,520
谁知道你们到底在搞什么
when he pretends your mail was misdelivered?

293
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,990
只是寄信  没有其他
Just mail, no benefits.

294
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,890
我明白了
I see.

295
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,190
你为什么问这个
Why are you asking?

296
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,890
我对于整个交际圈很是好奇
I'm curious about the whole social construct.

297
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,920
表面上看来 关于满足个人性欲方面
On its face, the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite--

298
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,920
假设某人受到这方面的折磨
assuming one is afflicted with such--

299
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,110
没有感情上的纠葛 这看似相当具有实用性
without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical.

300
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,120
不过  据我观察 霍华德·沃罗维茨却是 哭得像个小女孩一样
What I've observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

301
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,290
有些人只是无法处理好 那种关系而已
Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.

302
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,990
你能么
Can you?

303
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,390
什么
Excuse me?

304
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,490
你能否做到跟一个与自己
Are you able to have sex with men

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,360
毫无情感依恋的男人上床呢
without developing an emotional attachment?

306
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,860
谢尔顿  我实在不想跟你讨论这个话题
Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,060
这个话题让你感到不适了吗
Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?

308
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,660
当然了  我很不爽  看不出来吗
Of course it's making me uncomfortable. Can't you tell?

309
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,220
我看不出来
I really have no idea.

310
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,420
我实在不擅长解读
I don't particularly excel

311
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,190
脸部表情和肢体语言
at reading facial expressions, body language...

312
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,720
我要发飙了  谢同学
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

313
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,560
谢谢  我了解了
Thank you. That's very helpful.

314
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,860
好啦  极品虾仁在哪儿呢
All right, where are these amazing shrimp?

315
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,090
看
Behold.

316
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,990
说真的  你觉得这有婴儿手臂大吗
Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?

317
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,820
迷你婴儿
A little baby.

318
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,160
我回房间了
Okay, I'm going back to the room.

319
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,320
天啊  上一盘上等"胸肉" 他们会死么!
Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?

320
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,420
你好  我叫霍华德·沃罗维茨
Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

321
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,620
我叫埃斯特·罗森布拉特
Esther Rosenblatt.

322
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,880
看来管理员今晚不来了  给你
I don't think the manager's coming tonight, so here.

323
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,050
你准备让我睡沙发么
Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?

324
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,050
我起初不这么想
Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind,

325
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,810
但现在就这么定
but it's the one I'm going with.

326
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,350
我不能睡沙发  我是睡床的
I can't sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed.

327
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,810
你看看这尺寸
And given its dimensions,

328
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,950
我可不想成为EM斯尼科林畅销儿童书
I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering's

329
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,080
《康沃尔巨人》的真人版
beloved children's book, The Tall Man From Cornwall.

330
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,010
你说啥
What?

331
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,610
康沃尔巨人
"There was a tall man from Cornwall

332
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,150
身高超过床
"whose length exceeded his bed.

333
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,450
身子躺不平
"My body fits on it, but barely upon it,

334
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,110
大头容不下
there's no room for my big Cornish head."

335
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,950
我让你睡我的床  但有一个条件
All right, I will give you my bed on one condition:

336
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,680
你得在接下来8小时内闭上嘴
that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.

337
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,380
我能说最后一句话吗
May I say one last thing?

338
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,980
只要不押韵就成
Only if it doesn't rhyme.

339
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,810
好啊
All right.

340
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,180
晚安
Good night.

341
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,650
前戏么  我想想
Turn-ons? Let me see.

342
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,450
在火堆前读一本好书
Reading a good book in front of the fire,

343
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,550
沿着海滩漫步
long walks on the beach...

344
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,810
还有带着培根汉堡
and getting freaky on the Sabbath

345
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
在安息日[犹太人新年]狂欢
with a bacon cheeseburger.

346
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,710
真的吗  我也是
Really? Me, too!

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,610
哎呦喂  你好性感呐
Oy,gevalt,  you're hot.

348
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,750
确实
Yeah.

349
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,250
失陪一下下
Excuse me for a moment.

350
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,150
怎么样了
Hey, how's it going?

351
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,480
少废话  都是你一手安排的吧
Cut the crap. You set this up, didn't you?

352
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,480
对
Yes.

353
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,050
她是妓女  对吧
She's a hooker, isn't she?

354
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,350
对  娼妓
A prostitute, yes.

355
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,750
你已经付钱给她了?
You already gave her the money?

356
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,180
是
Yes.

357
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,010
太谢谢你了
Thank you!

358
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,650
佩妮
Penny?

359
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,080
咋了
What?

360
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,910
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

361
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,980
可能是因为你的嘴巴没闭上
Maybe that's because your hole is still open.

362
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,250
我想家了
I'm homesick.

363
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,450
你的家离这就20英尺
Your home is 20 feet from here.

364
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,710
20英尺  20光年  都没关系
20 feet, 20 light-years, it doesn't matter.

365
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,680
它就像在一个遥远的星系
It's in a galaxy far, far away.

366
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,580
妈的
Damn it.

367
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,510
你要我干嘛
What do you want me to do?

368
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,110
唱"乖乖猫"
Sing "Soft Kitty."

369
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,780
那是你病了才有的事
That's only for when you're sick.

370
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,480
想家也是一种病嘛
Homesick is a type of being sick.

371
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,210
拜托  非唱不可吗
Come on, do I really have to?

372
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,580
那就聊天吧
I suppose we can stay up and talk.

373
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,080
乖猫猫  暖猫猫
* Soft kitty, warm kitty *

374
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,580
小小毛绒球
* Little ball of fur *

375
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,080
快乐猫猫
* Happy kitty... *

376
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,050
瞌睡猫猫
Sleepy kitty.

377
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,850
-瞌睡猫猫  -不对
- * Sleepy kit... *  - No.

378
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,980
重来
Start over.

379
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,880
乖猫猫  暖猫猫
* Soft kitty, warm kitty *

380
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,780
小小毛绒球
* Little ball of fur *

381
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,310
快乐猫猫  瞌睡猫猫
* Happy kitty, sleepy kitty *

382
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,780
呜  呜  呜 [猫的叫声]
* Purr, purr, purr. *

383
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,880
佩妮
Penny?

384
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,080
怎么了
Yeah?

385
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,510
谢谢你让我住这
Thank you for letting me stay here.

386
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,480
不客气  甜心
Oh. You're welcome, sweetie.

387
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,750
行了  我有睡意了  出去吧
Okay, I'm sleepy now，get out.

388
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,180
太好了
Oh, good.

389
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
你终于回家了
You're finally home.

390
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,420
你在佩妮家搞什么
What were you doing at Penny's?

391
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,020
我们一起吃了晚餐
Well, we had dinner,

392
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,020
玩了些游戏  还睡了一晚
uh, played some games, and then I spent the night.

393
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,180
你应该很高兴  因为我终于
You'll be happy to know that I now have

394
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,750
对"互利友人"有更深的理解了
a much better understanding of "friends with benefits."
