1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,080
"星舰迷航"有新的内幕消息说
New more details about the new star trek film.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,970
会有描写史巴克出生的镜头
There's going to be a scene depicting spock's birth.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,360
我还是对描写
I'd be more interested

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,440
史巴克是如何被怀上的镜头更感兴趣
In a scene depicting spock's conception.
“星舰迷航”主人公之一 是Vulcan族

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,810
算了吧
Oh, please.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,580
对于瓦肯人  交配  或者你可以说"pon fahr"...
For vulcans, mating-- or if you will, pon fahr--
瓦肯人是 "星舰"系列中的瓦肯星人形生物  Pon farr 瓦肯人七年一次的发情期

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,230
这是超隐私的事情
It's an extremely private matter.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,120
但我还是想知道细节
Still, I'd like to know the details.

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,230
他母亲是个人类
His mother was human.

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,040
他父亲是个瓦肯人
His father is vulcan.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,160
他们不能随便就怀上了
They couldn't just conceive.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,740
也许他们得去个诊所
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,530
想象下史巴克的父亲身处一个小屋
Can you imagine spock's dad in a little room

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,570
里面全是长着尖耳和肥臀的怪物
With a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,190
怎么在星舰迷航里
How come on star trek

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,870
每个人的私密部位都长得一样啊?
Everybody's private parts are the same?

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,620
没有哪一个外星妞对柯克舰长(男主角)说过
No alien lady ever told captain kirk,

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,460
"把你那玩意从我鼻孔里拔出来"
"hey, get your thing out of my nose."

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,750
你们好  能不能帮帮忙?
Hi. can you help me?

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,110
我正在写电子邮件  然后a键坏了
I was writing an e-mail and the "a" key got stuck.

21
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,790
现在一按就"aaa..."
Now it's just going "aaa..."

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,570
什么东西洒上面了?
What'd you spill on it?

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,640
没啊
Nothing.

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,220
健怡可乐
Diet coke.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,000
还有酸奶
And yogurt.

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,350
还有点指甲油
And a little nail polish.

27
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,850
我先看看吧
I'll take a look at it.

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,360
先生们  请注意本地书呆子新闻
Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news--

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,500
今年的大学物理碗比赛  渔夫  陈  肖杜里和麦克奈
Fishman, chen, chaudury and mcnair aren't fielding a team

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,170
不打算组队参加了
In the university physics bowl this year.

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,480
不会吧  为什么啊
You're kidding. why not?

32
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,280
他们成立了一个理发店轻唱组
They formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,170
并将在诺氏果园表演
Playing knott's berry farm.
南加州一主题公园

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,320
这么说在你们的圈子里
Wow, so in your world

35
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,310
你们已经算是潮人了
You're like the cool guys.

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,960
正解
Recognize.

37
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,410
今年我们赢定了
This is our year.

38
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,440
那些家伙不参加  整个物理碗
With those guys out, the entire physics bowl

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,870
就将跪倒臣服于扎德了
Will kneel before zod.

40
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,010
扎德?
Zod?

41
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,960
超人里的一个大反派  说来话长
Kryptonian villain. long story.

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,040
挺有趣的
Good story.

43
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,910
我可不去
Well, count me out.

44
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,260
什么  为什么
What? why?

45
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,920
你们想利用我的聪明才智
You want me to use my intelligence

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,530
去参加那么庸俗的比赛?
In a tawdry competition?

47
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,520
你会叫毕加索
Would you ask

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,260
去玩看图猜字吗
Picasso to play pictionary?

49
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,870
你会叫韦伯斯特(词典编纂者)去玩猜字游戏吗
Would you ask noah webster to play boggle?
Noah Webster 美国词典编纂之父  Jacques Cousteau 法国海军将领 海洋生物学家

50
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,480
你会叫雅克·库斯托(知名潜水家)去玩钓鱼?
Would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish?

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,920
别这样  你需要一个四人团队
Come on, you need a four-person team.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,050
我们正好四个人
We're four people.

53
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,550
照你这么说  我们还得玩桥牌
By that reasoning we should also

54
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,350
举着一个天蓬
Play bridge, hold up a chuppah

55
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,450
去参加奥林匹克雪车速滑赛
And enter the olympic bobsled competition.

56
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,400
别忘了给我弄张票
Tickets to that, please.

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,290
谢尔顿  你什么意思  需要我引用
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote

58
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,290
史巴克临死前的一席话吗
Spock's dying words to you?
美国儿科专家 教育家和作家

59
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,270
别  不要
No, don't.

60
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,990
"...重于少数人的利益
"the needs of the many...

61
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,230
"...少数人的需求要重要
"...outweigh the needs of the few.

62
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,660
...或个人的利益"
...or the one."

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
该死  我去吧
Damn it, I'll do it.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,480
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第13集
The.Bat.Jar.Conjecture

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,330
参加物理碗比赛的头等大事儿
Okay, first order of physics bowl business

66
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,920
就是我们得起个拉风的队名
We need a truly kick-ass team name.

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,300
有什么想法没?
Suggestions?

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,160
叫永动机队怎么样?
How about the perpetual motion squad?

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,790
它超越了物理学的理论
It's beyond the laws of physics, plus

70
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,610
而且对女士们也是一种暗示
A little heads-up for the ladies.

71
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,690
女士们?
The ladies?

72
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,700
"永动机队...我们可以干一整夜"
"perpetual motion squad-- we can go all night."

73
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,470
我喜欢
I like it.

74
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,550
我不喜欢
I don't.

75
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,470
按照传统  一般都是以凶猛的动物取名
Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures,

76
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,570
以此来威慑对手
Thus intimidating one's opponent.

77
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,500
那我们应该叫孟加拉虎队
Then we could be the bengal tigers.

78
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,450
太垃圾了
Poor choice.

79
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,680
从合力来说
Gram for gram,

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,890
没有动物可以强过
No animal exceeds the relative fighting strength

81
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,060
热带行军蚁群
Of the army ant.

82
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,330
也许是吧
Maybe so,

83
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,090
但是你用放大镜
But you can't incinerate a bengal tiger

84
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,350
没法把孟加拉虎点着
With a magnifying glass.

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,470
我们还是投票吧
Let's put it to a vote.

86
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,050
-喜欢...  -你先等等
All those in favor... point of order.

87
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,670
我觉得团队的名字
I move that any vote on team names

88
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,870
需要意见完全统一
Must be unanimous.

89
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,710
你们不能在按常理
No man should be forced to emblazon his chest

90
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,800
都会选择热带行军蚁群的情况下
With a bengal tiger when common sense dictates

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,180
强制别人在胸口印一只孟加拉虎
It should be an army ant.

92
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,930
这位从不接受别人意见的绅士
Will the gentleman from the great state of denial

93
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,200
愿意屈服一次吗
Yield for a question?

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,370
我会屈服
I will yield.

95
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,080
当我们经过这
After we go through the exercise

96
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,660
无聊烦人的投票之后
Of an annoying series of votes,

97
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,090
这位绅士肯定会输
All of which the gentleman will lose,

98
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,590
然后当不能按照他的方式来
Does he then intend to threaten to quit

99
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,240
-他是否就要用退出来威胁大家?  -他会的
If he does not get his way? he does.

100
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,770
我同意热带行军蚁群  你们呢?
I move we are the army ants. all those in favor?

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,350
下午好  欢迎你们
Good afternoon, and welcome

102
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,490
来到今天的物理碗大赛练习赛
To today's physics bowl practice round.

103
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,490
我叫佩妮  将担任主持人
I'm penny, and I'll be your host

104
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,560
因为很明显  我周六下午
Because apparently I didn't have anything else to do

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
也没什么其它的事儿干
On a saturday afternoon,

106
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,330
这是不是有点悲哀?
And isn't that just a little sad?

107
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,450
先生们  准备好了吗
Gentlemen, are you ready?

108
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,010
-当然  -快开始吧
Yes. of course. fire away.

109
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,550
这可能不关我的事
You know, it's none of my business,

110
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,770
但有个男人在女人面前都不说话
But isn't a guy who can't speak

111
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,820
会不会让你们感觉有些自信心不足?
In front of women going to hold you back a little?

112
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,030
只要女人待在人群里
Oh, he'll be okay

113
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,500
他就应该没事儿
Once the women are mixed into the crowd.

114
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,270
只有当跟女人一对一并且那人闻起来很香时
He only has a problem when they're one-on-one

115
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,370
他才会出问题
And smell nice.

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
谢了  拉杰  是香草味的油
Ah, thanks, raj. it's vanilla oil.

117
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,600
其实我才是那个注意到的人
I was actually the one who noticed.

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,780
好的  开始吧
Okay, let's just start.

119
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,910
好  第一题
Okay, the first question

120
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,360
是关于光学的问题
Is on the topic of optics.

121
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,860
有史以来最短的光脉冲是多少?
"what is the shortest light pulse ever produced?"

122
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,330
库珀博士
Dr. cooper.

123
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,210
毫无疑问  答案是130百亿亿分之一秒
And of course the answer is 130 attoseconds.

124
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,980
-回答正确  -我也知道的
That is correct. I knew that, too.

125
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,110
你真棒  亲爱的
Good for you, sweetie.

126
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,020
好了  下个问题
Ok, next question.

127
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,770
何种量子力学效应
"what is the quantum mechanical effect

128
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,490
被应用在硬盘存储加密上?
"used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,640
霍华德
Howard?

130
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,970
毫无疑问  答案是
And of course the answer is

131
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,990
-巨磁阻  -正确
Giant magnetoresistance. right.

132
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,270
我先抢到的
Hey, I buzzed in.

133
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,620
然后我回答了  这叫团队合作
And I answered. it's called teamwork.

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,210
你难道不觉得应该
Don't you think I should answer

135
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,920
由我来回答工程问题吗  我是个工程师
The engineering questions? I am an engineer.

136
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
照这个逻辑  那我应该回答
By that logic I should answer

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,670
所有人类学的问题  因为我是哺乳动物
All the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.

138
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,310
问下一题吧
Just ask another one.

139
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,490
好的
Okay.

140
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,150
哪颗人造卫星记录下了
"what artificial satellite has seen glimpses

141
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,960
爱因斯坦预言的时空结构拖曳现象?
Of einstein's predicted frame dragging?"
致密天体 例如黑洞与中子星 它们的自转能吸引附近的空间与时间 围绕它们一同转
2004年发射升空 任务是探测地球附近的时空曲率

142
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,110
答案是引力探测器B卫星
And of course, it's gravity probe b.

143
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,720
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

144
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,570
你得让其他人也参与答题
You have to let somebody else answer.

145
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,410
为什么
Why?

146
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,100
因为这是礼貌
Because it's polite.

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,250
这跟礼貌有什么关系
What do manners have to do with it?

148
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,720
这是战争
This is war.

149
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,830
当罗马人在迦太基(北非一古城)地上撒盐
Were the romans polite when they salted the ground

150
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,820
确保以后寸草不生的时候他们讲礼貌了吗
Of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?

151
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,510
莱纳德  你说过我只负责提问的
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.

152
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,590
竞赛的目的就是为了给出正确答案
The objective of the competition is to give correct answers.

153
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,710
如果我知道  我为什么不说出来
If I know them, why shouldn't I give them?

154
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,400
因为也许我们也知道正确答案
Some of us might have the correct answers, too.

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,770
别逗了  你连博士学位都没有
Oh, please. you don't even have a phd.

156
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,510
好吧  够了!
All right, that's it!

157
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,240
-霍华德  坐下  -好吧
Howard, sit down. okay.

158
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,770
也许我们需要稍微休息一下
Maybe we should take a little break.

159
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,500
好主意  我得活动下腕关节
Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

160
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,730
按这些键弄得我以前
All this button-pushing

161
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,800
玩任天堂留下的老伤更严重了
Is aggravating my old nintendo injury.

162
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,990
我同意
I agree.

163
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,480
他说什么
What did he say?

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,420
他把谢尔顿比喻成
He compared sheldon

165
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,690
某种可能会在夏夜用到的
To a disposable feminine cleansing product

166
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,740
"夏依"女性清洁用品
One might use on a summer's eve.

167
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,220
没错  还有那进来的套套
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

168
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,030
莱纳德  太好了
Leonard, excellent.

169
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,340
我想给你看样东西
I want to show you something.

170
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,160
等等行吗  我想跟你谈谈
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

171
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,790
快看
Just look.

172
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,280
我刚为我们队设计了一款完美的队服
I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team.

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,200
颜色是基于"星际旅行"原始系列
The colors are based on star trek the original series.

174
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
你们三个穿上陪衬的红色
The three of you will wear support red,

175
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,830
我穿象征命令的金色
And I will wear command gold.

176
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,160
"AA"是什么意思?
Why do they say "aa"?

177
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,890
行军蚁
Army ants.

178
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,430
会不会容易产生歧义?
Isn't that confusing?

179
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,490
AA对某些人
"aa" might mean

180
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,980
可能表示其它的什么意思
Something else to certain people.

181
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,070
为什么一支物理碗比赛队
Why would a physics bowl team

182
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,910
会起名为阳极氧化铝呢
Be called anodized aluminum?

183
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,600
不  我是指...
No, I meant...

184
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,370
算了
Never mind.

185
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,590
来看看这个
Hey, check it out,

186
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,750
我给你买了个蝙蝠侠饼干罐
I got you a batman cookie jar.

187
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,150
太屌了
Oh, neat!

188
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,540
什么节日啊
What's the occasion?

189
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,190
朋友嘛  你又喜欢蝙蝠侠
Well, you're a friend, and you like batman

190
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,530
还有饼干  你被剔除出队了
And cookies, and you're off the team.

191
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,940
什么?
What?

192
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,620
霍华德  拉杰和我刚开了个团队会议
Howard, raj and I just had a team meeting.

193
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,310
-不  你们没开  -是  我们确实开了  我刚从那回来
No, you didn't. yes, we did. I just came from there.

194
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,290
好吧  不管你从哪里回来
Okay, I don't know where you just came from,

195
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,920
但是你们不可能开团队会议的
But it could not have have been a team meeting

196
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,630
因为我也是队员  并且我不在场
Because I'm on the team and I wasn't there.

197
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,580
因此  这个队并没有会
Ergo, the team did not meet.

198
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,180
好吧  我这么说吧
OK. let me try it this way.

199
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,180
我跟几个朋友一起喝了杯咖啡聊了聊
I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends,

200
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,420
然后由一件事谈到了另一件
And one thing led to another,

201
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,080
最后你就被剔除出队了
And it turns out you're off the team.

202
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,730
为什么啊?
Why?

203
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,220
因为你弄得大家都没有兴致了
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

204
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,150
抱歉
I'm sorry,

205
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,430
难道物理碗的获胜者
Is the winner of the physics bowl

206
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,160
是最有兴致的那支队伍?
The team that has the most fun?

207
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,050
好吧  我这么说吧
OK. let me try it this way.

208
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,850
你太招人烦了
You're annoying

209
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,770
没人愿意再跟你合作了
And no one wants to play with you anymore.

210
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,430
我知道了
I see.

211
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,850
这么说那我得通知你下
Well, at this point I should inform you

212
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,640
我打算组建自己的队伍
That I intend to form my own team

213
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,560
然后把组成你们的
And destroy the molecular bonds

214
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,180
一切分子键弄得粉碎
That bind your very matter together

215
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,320
把形成的胡乱状态的粒子全都变成你们的眼泪
And reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.

216
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,390
多谢提醒
Thanks for the heads-up.

217
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,570
不用谢
You're welcome.

218
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,640
-还有一件事  -什么?
One more thing. yes?

219
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,640
放马过来吧  婊子
It's on . B.I.T.C.H.

220
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,020
谁会跟他一组参赛呢
So who'd he get to be on his team?

221
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,230
他不说
He won't say.

222
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,430
他只是笑着从他的蝙蝠侠罐里拿蛋白杏仁饼干吃
He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.

223
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,720
他在跟你打心理战
He's using psychological warfare.

224
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,510
我们必须以牙还牙
We must reply in kind.

225
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,600
我是说等他看咱们的时候
I say we wait until he looks at us,

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,350
咱们也笑  好像在说"是  你是个聪明强大的对手"
Then laugh like, "yes, you are a smart and strong competitor,

227
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,180
"但我们也一样"
"but we are also smart and strong,

228
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,520
"我们非常有可能击败你"
And we have a reasonable chance of defeating you."

229
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,880
那我们到底该怎么笑呢
How exactly would that laugh go?

230
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,060
这听起来更像是  "我们是一个
That sounds more like, "we are a tall,
"101忠狗"中的邪恶女老板

231
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,670
想拨了你的达尔马提亚狗皮做大衣的瘦高个女人"
Thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

232
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,890
哥几个别忘了
Guys, let's remember

233
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,430
谢尔顿毕竟还是我们的朋友和我的室友
That sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.

234
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,450
那怎么了?
So?

235
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,030
没事
So nothing.

236
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,080
让我们整垮他吧
Let's destroy him.

237
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,560
先生们
Gentlemen.

238
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,410
我们得赶紧找一个最佳第四人
Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.

239
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,960
你们知道谁一看就很聪明吗
You know who is apparently very smart

240
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,810
我觉得演Blossom的那个女孩很聪明
Is the girl who played tv's blossom.

241
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,180
她有博士学位  神经学科或者其它什么
She got a phd. in neuroscience or something.

242
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,610
拉杰  我们不能让情景喜剧演员
Raj, we're not getting tv's blossom

243
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,450
加入我们的物理碗比赛队的
To join our physics bowl team.

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
那个主演"纯真年代"的女孩怎么样
How about the girl from the wonder years?

245
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,430
先生们  我相信我找到可以解决
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution

246
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,260
所有问题的办法了
To all our problems.

247
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,140
我们不能去找莱斯利·温克
We can't ask leslie winkle.

248
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,930
为什么?  就因为你和她睡过
Why? because you slept together,

249
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,850
而当她和你做完后
And when she was done with you

250
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,870
把你像隔夜的酸辣酱那样扔了?
She discarded you like last night's chutney?

251
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,350
是
Yes.

252
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,520
有时为了团队必须得牺牲个人
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.

253
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,420
是啊  有点男人样  伙计
Yeah, sack up, dude.

254
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,270
好吧
Fine.

255
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,290
我去  为了团队牺牲自己...
Here I go, taking one for the team...

256
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,570
男人
In the sack.

257
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,750
好  莱斯利
Hey, leslie.

258
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,150
你们好
Hi, guys.

259
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,570
莱斯利  我有个问题问你
So, leslie, I have a question for you,

260
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,570
可能会
And it might be

261
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,570
有些尴尬  考虑到我...
A little awkward, you know, given that i...

262
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,380
干过你
Hit that thang.

263
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,000
莱纳德  没有任何理由只因为我们
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,770
看过彼此在极度激动的快感下
Just because we've seen each other's faces

265
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,960
那扭曲的脸和裸体就感到有什么尴尬的
And naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.

266
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,750
没有吗
There's not?

267
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,550
天  听上去肯定应该很尴尬才是
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be.

268
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,050
放心  我们性生活的任何内容
Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship

269
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,520
包括你的喜好
Regarding your preferences,

270
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,500
你的手法  你的表现
Your idiosyncrasies, your performance

271
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,080
仍然在卧室所固有的
Are still protected by the inherent

272
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
隐蔽下被保护着
Confidentiality of the bedroom.

273
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
这话说得真好  但如果可以的话
That's all very comforting, but if it's okay,

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,940
我想开始说我的问题了
I'd like to get on to my question now.

275
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,020
