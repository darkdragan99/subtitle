1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,640
现在我调动步兵师
All right, I'm moving my infantry division...

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,710
和指环王中的半兽人兵团
...augmented by a battalion of orcs from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,710
我们从侧翼包夹了田纳西的志愿兵
We flank the Tennessee volunteers

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,130
而在北方 我们又一次赢得了葛底斯堡战役
and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,790
没这么容易
Not so fast.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,440
别忘了 南方还有两个步兵师
Remember, the South still has two infantry divisions.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,150
再加上超人和哥斯拉
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,630
半兽人是魔法部队 超人最怕魔法
No, no, no. Orcs are magic. Superman is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,580
更别提...
Not to mention

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,490
哥斯拉早已被伊利诺伊骑兵和绿巨人消灭
you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,770
为什么不让罗伯特·李将军冲锋?
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line
罗伯特·李 南北战争时期南军统帅

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,630
他可以带上湿婆和格涅沙
with Shiva and Ganesh?

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,750
- 可以点餐了吗? - 稍等 宝贝
-You guys ready to order? -Hang on,honey.

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,200
湿婆和格涅沙
Shiva and Ganesh,

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
印度教之神? 对抗整个北部联军?
the Hindu gods,against the entire Union army?

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,520
还有半兽人
And orcs.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,180
我稍候再来
I'll be back.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,240
不好意思
Excuse me.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,120
象头神格涅沙擅长清除障碍 湿婆是毁灭之神
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles and Shiva is the Destroyer.

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,460
当硝烟散尽之时
When the smoke clears

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,980
林肯将会一边说着印地语 一边喝南方的薄荷饮料
Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
我老板说你们要么点餐 要么就给他滚蛋
All right,my boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back.

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,380
对于做了一早上的举重和有氧锻炼 冒着甜美气息的我
What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,360
有什么推荐菜式?
from a morning of weight training and cardio funk?

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,970
洗澡
A shower.

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,070
我要个奶酪拼盘
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,520
好 谢谢你 谢尔顿呢?
All right,thank you,and Sheldon?

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,360
我们没在这里吃过
We don't eat here.

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,610
不知道什么好吃
I don't know what's good.

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,660
都很好吃
Well,it's all good.

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,870
概率上不太可能
Statistically unlikely.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
就点一个汉堡
Just get a hamburger.

33
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,400
你喜欢汉堡
You like hamburgers.

34
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,650
我喜欢我们常去的那家汉堡店的汉堡
I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers.

35
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,970
不能假定我也喜欢这里的汉堡
You can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.

36
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,070
对不起
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,640
给他一个汉堡
Give him a hamburger.

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,140
好吧 哪种?
All right,which one?

39
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,500
经典汉堡 农家汉堡
The Classic Burger,the Ranch House Burger,

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,970
烧烤汉堡 柯比汉堡?
the Barbecue Burger,or the Kobe Burger?

41
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,130
能不能去大胖汉堡店?
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

42
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,110
他们只有一种汉堡 大胖汉堡
They only have one burger... the Big Boy.

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,720
烧烤汉堡跟大胖汉堡挺像的
Well,the Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.

44
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,480
对不起 既然世上已经有大胖汉堡
Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,910
为什么我们要满足于像大胖汉堡呢?
why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?

46
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,960
因为你不在大胖汉堡店!
Because you're not at Big Boy!

47
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,100
好吧 那我要烧烤汉堡
Fine,I'll have the Barbecue Burger.

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,870
我也要这个
Make it two.

49
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,720
大胖汉堡店的侍应从不冲被人嚷嚷
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,000
- 嘿 莱纳德 - 你们好
-Hey,Leonard. -Hi,guys.

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
你好 莱斯利
Hey. Hi,Leslie.

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,770
- 不知道你们会来这里吃饭 - 确实不会
I didn't know you ate here. We don't.

53
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,200
这次是很不愉快的例外
This is a disturbing aberration.

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,560
莱斯利 他是佩妮
Leslie,this is Penny.

55
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,300
她住在我和谢尔顿的对面
She lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,750
她走在美的光彩中 像夜晚
And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
诗人拜伦的名句

57
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,180
霍华德 我已经说了 别这样
Howard,I've asked you not to do that.

58
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,430
莱斯利和我在同个大学做研究
Leslie and I do research together at the university.

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,920
哇 女科学家
Oh,wow,a girl scientist.

60
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,000
没胸 只好多长点大脑
Yep,come for the breasts,stay for the brains.

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,720
碰见你太好了
So,I'm glad I ran into you.

62
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,480
物理系弦乐四重奏还缺一个大提琴
The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist.

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,320
埃利奥特·王怎么啦?
What happened to Elliot Wong?

64
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,010
他调到高能辐射课题组了
He switched over to high-energy radiation research

65
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,680
发生一些小意外 其他团员怕坐他身边被辐射
had a little mishap,and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,380
你来不来?
So are you in?

67
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,670
当然来
Yeah,sure,why not?

68
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,970
太好了 周二去你那里彩排
Great,we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.

69
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,940
为什么去我那里?
Why at my place?

70
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,980
能源部说我们原来 排练的地方现在是危险区
Yeah,Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,950
很高兴见到你
Nice meeting you.

72
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,390
我也是
Yeah,you,too.

73
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,610
莱纳德 不知道你会拉大提琴
Leonard,I didn't know you played the cello.

74
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,050
是啊 我父母觉得给我取名莱纳德
Yeah,my parents felt that naming me Leonard

75
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,530
把我扔进大学先修班
and putting me in Advanced Placement classes

76
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,920
还不够把我搞倒
wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

77
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,190
你喜欢音乐吗? 我会学架子鼓
If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.

78
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,270
真的?
Really?

79
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,460
其实我不是太喜欢音乐
I'm actually not that into music.

80
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,320
你那个朋友不错  你们俩是不是有点情况?
So,hey,your friend's really cute. Anything going on with you two?

81
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,830
莱斯利?
L - Leslie?

82
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,020
没有 怎么可能?
No,no. What,are you kidding?

83
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,530
他约过她一次 不过尴尬地失败了
He asked her out once. It was an embarrassing failure.

84
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,650
多谢 谢尔顿
Thank you,Sheldon.

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,300
噢 对不起
Oh,I'm sorry.

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,550
这个需要保密吗?
Was that supposed to be a secret?

87
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,910
哦 太可惜了
Aw,that's too bad.

88
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,110
你们本可以做一对甜蜜情侣
You guys'd make a cute couple.

89
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,050
我的天
Oh,dear.

90
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,710
怎么了?
What's the matter?

91
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,920
她没问我点什么
She didn't take my order.

92
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,850
她怎么问你?
How can she take your order

93
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,240
你紧张得连话都不会说
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

94
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,340
尽管如此 这将反映在她的小费上
Nevertheless,this will be reflected in her tip.

95
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,030
佩妮说"你们本可以做一对甜蜜情侣" 什么意思?
What did Penny mean,"You'd make a cute couple?"

96
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,770
我想她的意思是 你们两个在一起可以组成情侣
Well,I assume she meant the two of you together would constitute a couple

97
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,020
并且令其他人觉得你们甜蜜
that others might consider cute.

98
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,080
另一个不太可能的解释是
An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation

99
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,280
你们可以制造一对情侣
is that you could manufacture one.

100
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,470
例如 "快看 莱纳德和莱斯利所生的高德法布夫妻
As in,"Oh,look,Leonard and Leslie made Mr.and Mrs.Goldfarb.

101
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,640
是不是很可爱?"
Aren't they adorable?"

102
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,450
如果佩妮不知道莱斯利拒绝过我
If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down,

103
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,430
那么这一句的所指将十分明确
then it would unambiguously mean

104
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,850
即 她(佩妮)认为我应该追她(莱斯利)
that she,Penny,thought I should ask her,Leslie,out

105
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,860
表明她(佩妮)对于我 追求她(佩妮)并无兴趣
indicating that she,Penny, had no interest in me asking her,Penny,out.

106
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,330
但由于她知道我追过莱斯利
But,because she did know that I had asked Leslie out

107
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,280
并且她(莱斯利)已经拒绝我
and that she,Leslie,had turned me down,

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,130
那么她(佩妮)可能只是安慰我
then she,Penny,could be offering consolation.

109
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,410
"真可惜 你们本来 可以做一对甜蜜情侣..."
"That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple..."

110
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,110
并且暗想 "很好 莱纳德还是单身"
but while thinking:"Good, Leonard remains available."

111
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,220
你很幸运 莱纳德
You're a lucky man,Leonard.

112
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,780
怎么说?
How so?

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,070
听你说话的人
You're talking to one of the three men

114
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,190
是西半球仅有的三个 能跟得上你思维的人之一
in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,070
那么 你怎么看?
Well,what do you think?

116
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,890
我只是说我能跟上 不代表我有兴趣
I said I could follow it. I didn't say I care.

117
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,800
* 宇宙是个大火炉 *
Our whole universe was in a hot,dense state

118

The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools

121

* 数学 科学 历史  揭露奥秘*
Math,Science,History,unraveling the mystery

123
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,400
*  就从宇宙大爆炸开始! *
That all started with a big bang

124
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,770
磅
Bang!

The.Hamburger.Postulate

126
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,380
我很欣赏你的指法
I admire your fingering.

127
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,060
谢谢
Thank you.

128
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,820
也许你可以在我的"乐器"上演练一下
Maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument.

129
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,880
- 晚安兄弟 练得不错 - 谢谢
Good night,guys. Good job. Thanks.

130
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,160
下周见
See you next week.

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,030
挺好玩的 莱斯利 多谢你叫上我
That was fun,Leslie. Thanks for including me.

132
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,900
不客气
You're welcome.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,690
如果你有兴趣
If you're up for it

134
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,120
我们可以练一下中间部分
we could practice that middle section again.

135
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,850
当然好
Sure,why not?

136
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,020
说说清楚比较好 你知不知道我留下来陪你加练
Just so we're clear,you understand that me hanging back to practice with you

137
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,090
是一个铺垫 为了让你知道我是潜在性对象
is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.

138
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,910
真的?
Really?

139
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,870
是的 我随时可以
Yeah,I'm good to go.

140
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,230
我以为你对我没兴趣
I thought you weren't interested in me.

141
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,680
那是在看到你摆弄两腿之间 那块优雅的木头之前
That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

142
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,190
你是指大提琴?
You mean my cello?

143
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,870
不 那是一个明显下流的双关
No,I mean the obvious,crude,double entendre.

144
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,050
我在勾引你
I'm seducing you.

145
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,120
不是吧
No kidding.

146
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,730
怎么说呢? 我是有激情的冲动型女人
What can I say? I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

147
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,580
你说呢?
So how about it?

148
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,670
这个 呃...
Gee. Uh...

149
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,040
因为那个侍应生?
Is it the waitress?

150
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,370
佩妮?
Penny?

151
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,590
她怎么了?
What about her?

152
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,880
你看她的时候瞳孔放大
I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her.

153
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,290
这表明有性吸引力 除非是海洛因成瘾反应
Which,unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.

154
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,050
我早餐吃了一个含罂粟籽的百吉饼
Well,I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast.

155
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,080
可能导致阿片碱尿检阳性
Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates

156
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,850
但肯定不至于扩大瞳孔
but certainly not dilate my pupils.

157
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,000
所以...我不知道为什么要说起这个
So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,650
你和那个侍应生
You and the waitress then.

159
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,960
没有 没有
No... no.

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,920
我和佩妮之间没什么
There's nothing going on between Penny and me.

161
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,400
所以你可以建立性关系咯?
So you're open to a sexual relationship?

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
可以可以 我想
Yeah,yeah,I guess I am.

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,290
好
Good.

164
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,040
很好
Yeah,it is. It is good.

165
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,360
要现在就开始?
Did you want to start now?

166
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,620
演完这一章吧
Why don't we finish the section first?

167
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
好的
Oh,okay.

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,510
音乐前戏 不错
A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

169
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,780
- 我准备好了 - 我也是
I'm g-good to go. Me,too.

170
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,080
谢尔顿 怎么了?
Oh,hey,Sheldon. What's going on?

171
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,080
我需要符号学方面的帮助
I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.

172
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,270
什么?
I'm sorry?

173
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,390
符号学 研究符号和象征
Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols.

174
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,470
是语言学基本理论的分支
It's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.

175
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,760
亲爱的 我知道你以为自己在解释
Okay,sweetie, I know you think you're explaing yourself

176
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,490
其实你真的没有
but you're really not.

177
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,230
跟我来
Just come with me.

178
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,350
怎样?
Well?

179
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,530
什么怎样?
Well,what?

180
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,600
什么意思?
What does it mean?

181
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,850
得了 你上过大学的
Oh,come on,you went to college.

182
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,330
是的 我那是才11岁上
Yes,but I was 11.

183
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,490
好吧 是这样
All right,look,

184
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,980
门把手上挂条领带 意思是里面的人不想被打扰
a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,390
因为...他们 在忙活
because,they're... you know,gettin' busy.

186
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,360
就是说莱纳德跟个女孩在房间里?
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?

187
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,330
不然就是他丢了衣架
Well,either that or he's lost his tie rack

188
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,830
并且真的疯狂地喜欢布莱恩·亚当斯
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

189
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,760
莱纳德 你这了不起的野兽!
Oh,Leonard,you magnificent beast.

190
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,170
我们真不该站这了
We really shouldn't be standing here.

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,420
太尴尬了
This is very awkward.

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,910
不会吧 莱纳德以前也带女孩回来过 是吧?
Oh,come on,Leonard's had girls over before,right?

193
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,820
有的 但通常要计划 求爱 并且提前通知...
Oh,yes,but there's usually planning, courtship,advance notice...

194
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,660
就像上次 我才有时间预订去北极看日食的旅行
Last time,I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

195
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,060
就应为你室友要做爱 你就得离开这个国家?
You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?

196
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,600
不是一定要 时间上完全是个巧合
I didn't have to. The dates just happened to coincide.

197
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,140
你知道里面那是谁吗?
So,do you know who's in there?

198
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
里面有莱纳德
Well,there's Leonard.

199
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,110
跟他在一起的要么是莱斯利·温克 要不就是30年代的黑帮
And he's either with Leslie Winkle or a 1930s gangster.

200
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,850
他真不错
Hmm,good for him.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,010
恭喜莱纳德
Good for Leonard.

202
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,880
好吧 晚安
Okay,g'night.

203
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,410
等等 别走!
No,no,wait,hold on.

204
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,860
怎么了?
What's the matter?

205
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,230
我不知道这种情况下标准做法是什么
I don't know what the protocol is here.

206
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,060
我该留下来? 还是出去?
Do I stay? Do I leave?

207
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,290
他们出来时 要递上提神饮料吗?
Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?

208
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,980
谢尔顿 你问错人了
Gee,Sheldon,you're asking the wrong girl.

209
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,240
我通常在领带的另一边
I'm usually on the other side of the tie.

210
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
你好 莱纳德?
Hi,Leonard?

211
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,150
是我 谢尔顿
It's me,Sheldon...

212
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,930
我在客厅
In the living room.

213
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,810
我就想告诉你 我看到领带了
I just... I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

214
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,190
消息收到
Message received.

215
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,890
不客气
You're welcome.

216
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,220
继续吧
Carry on.

217
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,680
向莱斯利问好
Give my best to Leslie.

218
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
大胖汉堡...
Big Boy...

219
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,620
有人动过我的写字板
Someone touched my board.

220
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,300
天啊 我的写字板!
Oh,God,my board!

221
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,290
莱纳德! 莱纳德!
Leonard! Leonard!

222
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,420
怎么了?
Hey,what's the matter?

223
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,850
有人改过我的公式!
My equations,someone's tampered with my equations.

224
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,490
- 你确定? - 很确定!
Are you sure? Of course I'm sure.

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,300
看看量子色动力学的贝塔函数
Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics.

226
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,930
符号被改了!
The sign's been changed.

227
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,700
对哦
Oh,yeah.

228
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,830
那不正好解决了你的问题吗?
But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?

229
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,490
你疯了吗? 你傻了吗?
Are you insane? Are you out of your mind?

230
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,470
你...哦 瞧瞧
Are you... hey,look.

231
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,180
这正好解决了我的问题
That fixes the problem I've been having.

232
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,970
不客气
You're welcome.

233
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,580
你干的?
Youdid this?

234
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,870
我起来喝水的时候发现的
Yeah,I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water.

235
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,990
我改了 这样就能证明夸克
So I fixed it and now you can show that quarks

236
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,870
在高能状态下是渐进自由的
are asymptotically free at high energies.

237
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,350
很赞吧?
Pretty cool,huh?

238
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,160
"赞"?
"Cool"?

239
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,030
我要去实验室了
Listen,I've got to get to the lab.

240
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,100
昨晚很棒 谢了
Thanks for a great night.

241
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,970
谢谢 上班见
Thank you. I'll see you at work.

242
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,750
等等!
Hold on. Hold on!

243
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,290
怎么?
What?

244
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,560
谁说你可以碰我的写字板的?
Who told you you could touch my board?

245
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,480
没人
No one.

246
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,860
我不会去你家碰你的写字板
Yeah,I don't come into your house and touch your board.

247
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,820
我的板子上没有错误的公式啊
There are no incorrect equations on my board.

248
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,790
你真是...
Oh,that is so...

249
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,340
太...
so...

250
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,090
对不起 我要走了
I'm sorry,I've got to run.

251
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,540
如果你想好形容词 短信发我
If you come up with an adjective,text me.

252
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,160
不体谅
Inconsiderate.

253
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,840
就是这个词 "不体谅"
That is the adjective,"inconsiderate. "

254
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,570
你就算一直瞪着写字板 谢尔顿
You can stare at your board all day,Sheldon.

255
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,870
她还是对的
She's still going to be right.

256
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,870
我不是在瞪 我在思索
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

257
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,160
- 嘿 莱纳德 - 嗨
Oh,hey,Leonard. Oh,hi.

258
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,460
那么...
So...

259
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,650
如何呀?
...how's it going?

260
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,100
还好
Pretty good.

261
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,950
只是还好?
Just pretty good?

262
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,870
我觉得是很好呀
I'd think you were doing very good.

263
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,950
"还" "很"只是描述"好"的变化程度 并没有客观的范围
Pretty,very... there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of "good. "

264
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,900
你为什么这么问?
Why do you ask?

265
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,910
小鸟告诉我昨晚你跟莱斯利勾搭上了
Well,a little bird told me that you and Leslie hooked up last night.

266
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,150
谢尔顿!
Sheldon!

267
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,020
你是来真的? 你喜欢她吗?
So,is it serious? Do you like her?

268
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,730
我不...
I don't...

269
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,290
那是两个不同的问题
Th-th-that's really two different questions.

270
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,750
我不是...
Uh,I'm not...

271
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,670
谢尔顿 我们得走了!
Sheldon,we have to go!

272
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,930
对于一个刚进行过性交的人来说 你真是出奇的紧张啊
Boy,you're wound awfully tight for a man who's just had sexual intercourse.

273
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,200
好吧 下次再说吧 不过我真为你高兴 莱纳德
All right,well,I'll talk to you later, but I am so happy for you,Leonard.

274
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,180
谢谢
Thank you.

275
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,590
她为我高兴是什么意思?
What did she mean she's happy for me?

276
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,850
她高兴我现在有伴了?
Is she happy that I'm seeing someone?

277
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
还是因为我开心所以她高兴?
Or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy?

278
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,650
如果一个人喜欢别人 就会希望那人开心吧?
Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy.

279
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,680
就算那人开心的理由让前者伤心
Even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy.

280
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,380
因为开心的后者
Because the second person,though happy,

281
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,810
就不能跟前者成为情侣了
is now romantically unavailable to the first person.

282
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,650
你意识到我可能要跟你的性交对象 分享诺贝尔奖吗?
Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

283
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,080
你知道吗?
You know what?

284
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,770
我真可笑
I'm being ridiculous.

285
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,710
谁在乎佩妮怎么想?
Who cares what Penny thinks?

286
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,260
莱斯利是个很棒的女孩
Leslie is a terrific girl.

287
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,140
漂亮
She's attractive.

288
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,980
我们喜欢对方
We like each other.

289
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,710
她还超级聪明
She's extremely intelligent...

290
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,610
哪有很聪明
She's not that intelligent.

291
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,030
她修正了你的方程式
She fixed your equation.

292
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,030
- 那是走运 - 你根本不相信运气这种事
She got lucky. You don't believe in luck.

293
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,950
我不信 但她也可以走运
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.

294
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,630
不管怎样 我现在有机会和莱斯利发展一段真正的恋情
Regardless,I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie.

295
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,110
我不会就这么放弃的
I'm not going to pass that up for some

296
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,520
而只为了跟一个可能希望 也可能不希望我和别人开心的女人
hypothetical future of happiness with a woman

297
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,900
拥有一段假想的幸福未来
who may or may not want me to be happy,

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,280
而现在 那个别人已经让我很开心了
with a woman who is currently making me happy.

299
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,530
- 莱纳德...  - 啊?
Leonard... Yeah?

300
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,480
我还是没兴趣
I still don't care.

301
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,180
- 嗨 莱斯利 - 小心 莱纳德
Hey,Leslie. Careful,Leonard.

302
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,650
液氮 华氏零下320度
Liquid nitrogen,320 degrees below zero.

303
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,210
你为什么要砸碎速冻香蕉?
Why are smashing a flash-frozen bana?

304
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,590
我有一碗麦片 又找不到刀子
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife. Oh.

305
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,930
那么...
So anyway...

306
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,310
你好
Hello.

307
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,550
你在干嘛?
Uh,what are you doing?

308
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,880
跟你亲近一下
Just extending the intimacy.

309
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,580
想溜进辐射实验室
Hey,do you want to slip over to the radiation lab

310
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,190
一起洗个去污澡吗?
and share a decontamination shower?

311
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,280
好吧 你觉得我们俩之间发生了什么事?
Okay,uh,what exactly do you think's going on between us?

312
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,350
不知道 不过我可能就要知道那香蕉什么感觉了
I'm not sure,but I think I'm about to discover how the bana felt.

313
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,600
莱纳德 我们都不是神经学家
Listen,Leonard,neither of us are neuroscientists

314
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,710
但是都了解性的生物化学原理
but we both understand the biochemistry of sex.

315
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,410
脑中的多巴胺在神经键中释放 造成快感
I mean,dopamine in our brains is released across synapses,causing pleasure.

316
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,940
在老鼠大脑里插入电极 再给它个高潮按键
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button,

317
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,480
它会一直按着那个键直到死
he'll push that thing until he starves to death.

318
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,900
谁不会呢?
Well,who wouldn't?

319
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,330
我们跟老鼠的区别就在于
Well,the only difference between us and the rat

320
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,830
我们不能在我们视丘下部置入电极
is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus.

321
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,580
所以你就派上用场了
That's where you come in.

322
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,300
很高兴能起到作用
Yeah,well,I'm just glad to be a part of it.

323
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,050
那么现在如何?
So what happens now?

324
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,530
不知道你性欲多强烈 但我到新年之前应该都够了
Well,I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's.

325
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,470
好吧 谢谢
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

326
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,350
谢谢你
Thank you.

327
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,740
你想定下新年的计划吗?
You want to make plans for New Year's?

328
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,190
莱纳德 拜托了 你噎到我了
Whoa,Leonard,please. You're smothering me.

329
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,170
抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

330
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,930
瞧瞧
Hey,look.

331
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,390
这不是种马博士吗!
It's Dr. Stud!

332
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,460
什么博士?
Dr. What?

333
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,200
博客界的人都因为你跟莱斯利
The blogosphere is a-buzzin'with news of you

334
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,970
奏响的嘿休小夜曲兴奋不已呢!
and Leslie Winkle makingeine kleine bang-bangmusik.

335
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,920
这事怎么传上网的?
What? How did it get on the Internet?

336
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,500
我放上去的
I put it there.

337
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,090
你怎么知道的?
Well,how did you know about it?

338
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,100
小鸟告诉我们的
A little bird told us.

339
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,770
很明显 你是头野兽
Apparently,you are a magnificent beast.

340
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,740
那倒是真的
That part's true.

341
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,950
我想我以前误解这家餐厅了
You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.

342
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,780
不是吧
No kidding.

343
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,770
我不想冒险
I don't want to go out on a limb,

344
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,210
但我可能找到了新的周二汉堡包
but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.

345
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,200
原来的周二汉堡会很伤心的
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted.

346
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,860
早想到了
Way ahead of you.

347
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,680
我想把"大胖汉堡"挪到周四
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,

348
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,150
放弃"汤植园" (一家自助餐厅)
and just dropping Souplantation.

349
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,560
- 真的? - 对
Really? Yeah.

350
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,420
我总是搞不懂这名字
The name always confused me anyway.

351
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,040
汤植园
Souplantation.

352
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,000
汤可没法种植出来
You can't grow soup.

353
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,090
如何呀?
So,how's everything?

354
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,280
棒极了
Mmm! Terrific.

355
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,560
你会很高兴的看到 我打算每周二晚上都来这
You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night

356
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,140
在可预见的将来
for the foreseeable future.

357
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,060
真的? 太好了~
Really? Oh,yay!

358
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,070
如果要永久订下这张台 要跟谁谈?
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?

359
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,720
不知道 心理医生吧?
Um... I don't know... a psychiatrist?

360
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,150
嘿
So,hey

361
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,990
你和莱斯利如何?
how are things with you and Leslie?

362
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,860
说实话 我认为是没戏了
Oh,to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.

363
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,560
啊 太糟了
Oh. Oh,that's too bad.

364
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,800
别担心
Well,hey,don't worry.

365
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,040
我相信会有合适你的人的
I'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you.

366
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,850
她那么说什么意思?
What did she mean by that?!

367
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,000
是普通的安慰语?
Was that just a generic platitude,

368
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,780
还是吸引我注意的微妙暗示?
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

369
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,480
你知道这个比大胖汉堡强的原因吗?
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?

370
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,160
这是单层的 大胖汉堡是双层
This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

371
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,180
这个汉堡的肉 面包和调料的比例 更令人满意
This has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

372
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,620
你在听我说话吗?
Are you even listening to me?

373
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,650
当然 在听
Of course,I'm listening.

374
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,890
废话+关于佩妮无望的幻想+废话
Blah,blah,hopeless Penny delusion,blah,blah,blah.

375
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,790
那好吧
Okay,then.

376
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,170
你知道 汤的配料是可以种植的
You know,you can grow the ingredients for soup.
