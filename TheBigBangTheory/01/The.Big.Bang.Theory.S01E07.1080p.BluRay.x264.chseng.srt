1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,670
看好了 超级酷
Watch this,it's really cool.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,650
呼叫莱纳德.霍夫斯塔德
Call leonard hofstadter.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,240
您需要呼叫海伦.博克斯莱特纳吗?
Did you say: "Call helen boxleitner"?

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,390
不
No.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
呼叫莱纳德.霍夫斯塔德
Call leonard hofstadter.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,160
您需要呼叫坦布尔.巴斯塞得吗?
Did you say: "Call temple beth seder"?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,810
- 不 - 让我试试
- No. - Here,let me try it.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,550
呼叫麦克弗洛罗.麦克夫鲁尼路
Call mcflono mcfIlooloon

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,620
正在呼叫拉杰.库萨帕里
calling rajesh koothrappali.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,160
真是叹为观止啊
oh,it's very impressive.

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,250
再加点种族主义
And a little racist.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,230
你们嘲讽科技瑕疵够了吧
If we're all through playing "mock the flawed technology,"

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,700
能不能开始玩光晕了?
can we get on with halo night?

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,270
8点就该开始的 现在已经8:06
We were supposed to start at 8:00. It is now 8:06.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,050
那就现在开始
So we'll start now.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,790
我们得先决定
Yes,first we have to decide

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,120
这失去的6分钟要怎么补回来 削减游戏时间 厕所时间 还是吃饭时间?
if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,940
我们可以平分成2分钟 2分钟 2分钟
We could split it two,two and two.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,370
如果我们吃凤尾鱼披萨  厕所时间可就省不出来了
If we're having anchovies on the pizza,we can't take it out of bathroom time.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,670
又他妈怎么了?
oh,what fresh hell is this?

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,490
嘿 佩里 请进
Oh,hey,penny. Come on in.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,790
各位好
Hey,guys.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,990
捡到一便士 好运行将至
See a penny,pick her up,and all the day you'll have good luck.
penny又意为便士

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,260
不 你不会
No,you won'T.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,070
我能在这边呆会儿吗?
Uh,can I hide out here for a while?

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
当然可以 怎么了?
Sure. What's going on?

27
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,550
有个女孩 是我在内布拉斯加的老相识 她叫克里斯汀
Well,there's this girl I know from back in nebraska,christy.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,940
她打电话给我 问起加州感觉如何
Anyway,she called me up,and she's like,"hey,how's california?"

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,500
我回答说超棒  因为不是内布拉斯加啊
And I'm like,"awesome," 'cause,you know,it's not nebraska.

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,030
然后她居然自己跑过来 要和我一起住
And the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,130
8:08咯
8:08.

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,450
她今天刚到 一直呆在我房间 唧歪每一个她在奥马哈睡过的男人
Anyway,she got here today and she's just been in my apartment yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in omaha,

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,560
差不多也就是奥马哈所有的男人
which is basically every guy in omaha,

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,110
她还在我浴室水池里 洗你能想像到的最淫荡的内衣
and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,500
她一次只洗一件 还是混在一起...
Is she doing it one thong at a time,or does she throw it all in...

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,610
像某种色情盛宴?
like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,490
- 他真的需要降降温 - 我知道
- He really needs to dial it down. - I know.

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,070
你不喜欢克里斯汀的话 干嘛让她留下?
So if you don't like this christy,why are you letting her stay?

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,850
她跟我弟弟睡的时候 和我表兄订婚了
Well,she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother,

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,440
说起来也算是个家人
so she's kind of family.

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,260
我为自己刚才的爆发道歉
I apologize for my earlier outburst.

42
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,570
有奥马哈骚货的民间故事可以传诵 谁还要玩光晕?
Who needs halo,when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha?

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,720
我不觉得她是骚货
Oh,I don't think she's a whore.

44
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,760
不 她绝对是个骚货
No,yeah,she's definitely a whore.

45
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,220
她根本就没有原则
I mean,she has absolutely no standards.

46
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,840
有一次我们在...
This one time she was at...

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,000
霍华德哪去了?
where's howard?

48
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,430
早上好 小姐
Bonjour,mademoiselle.

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,910
我知道你是新来的
I understand you're new in town.

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,140
哦 好悲伤
Oh,good grief.

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,500
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第07集
The.Dumpling.Paradox

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,990
真不敢相信克里斯汀居然让霍华德进我家
Aw,I cannot believe christy let howard into my apartment.

53
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,080
我也不敢相信居然有人花钱去占星
And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes,

54
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,400
更严肃的问题是 现在已经8:13 我们还没开始玩光晕
but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing halo.

55
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,690
好吧 我们玩一对一 等他回来
Okay,fine. We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back.

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,810
一对一? 我们从不玩一对一的
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,640
我们玩团队 不玩一对一 你这一对一
We play teams,not one-on-one. One-on-one.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,480
现在想玩团队 只能把拉杰剖两半
Well,the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half.

59
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,140
好啊 一个外国人倒下来 千百万个外国人站起来!
Oh sure,cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.

60
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,080
你们缺人的话 我加入
Hey,if you guys need a fourth,I'll play.

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,930
好主意
Great idea.

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,980
不要
No.

63
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,930
车轮的发明是个好主意 相对论也是个好主意
The wheel was a great idea,relativity was a great idea.

64
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,980
这只是个想法 还是相当糟糕的想法
This is a notion,and a rather sucky one at that.

65
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,660
为什么?
Why?

66
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,790
为什么?
Why?

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,970
哦 佩里 佩里 佩里
Oh,penny,penny,penny.

68
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,370
哦 怎么 怎么 怎么?
Oh,what,what,what?

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,650
这是款复杂的战斗模拟 对玩家要求很高
This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,590
要学习无数种武器 交通工具 和战略战术
There are myriad weapons,vehicles and strategies to master,

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,830
更别提复杂的故事背景了
not to mention an extremely intricate backstory.

72
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,030
好酷 我把谁的头打爆了?
oh cool. Whose head did I just blow off?

73
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,510
我的
Mine.

74
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,880
我会啦 填弹药 兄弟们
Okay,I got this. Lock and load,boys.

75
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,900
只有这样才能玩团队
It's the only way we can play teams.

76
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,580
但她缺乏经验 她搭档会被拖累
Yes,but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience,

77
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,060
更别说她...
and not to mention the fact...

78
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,520
你头又掉啦
there goes your head again.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,870
别人刚复活就宰了人家 可不符合运动精神
Okay,it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

80
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,770
你得给人家一个机会... 来吧!
You need to to give them a chance to... now,come on!

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,130
拉杰 拉杰! 她把我逼到死角了 掩护我!
Raj,raj! She's got me cornered.Cover me!

82
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,160
尝尝这个吧 还掩护呢!
Cover this,suckers!

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,080
佩里 你太火爆了!
Penny,you are on fire!

84
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,160
是啊 谢尔顿也着火了
Yes,and so is sheldon.

85
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,940
我受够了
Okay,that's it.

86
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,920
我不知道怎么回事 但她作弊
I don't know how,but she is cheating.

87
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,480
美女不可能这么会打游戏的
No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,850
等一下 谢尔顿 回来
Wait,wait,sheldon,come back.

89
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,320
你忘带东西了
You forgot something.

90
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,450
什么?
What?

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,570
这个血浆手榴弹
This plasma grenade.

92
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,170
看 在帮你灭火呢
look,it's raining you.

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,170
你就笑吧... 你会需要技术支持的
You laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support.

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,610
唉 他就这么输不起吗?
Gosh,he's kind of a sore loser,isn't he?

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,970
公平点说 他赢了也不会开心
Well,to be fair,he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

96
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,540
还挺好玩的
Well,it's been fun.

97
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,050
佩里 我们这么合作愉快
You know,penny,we make such a good team.

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,600
也许我们可以去参加光晕锦标赛呢
Maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime.

99
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,540
或者我们还是好好生活吧
Or we could just have a life.

100
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,590
我猜那是你的选择
I guess for you that's an option.

101
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
- 晚安 莱纳德 - 晚安
- Good night,leonard. - Good night.

102
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,990
和你聊天很愉快 拉杰
As usual,nice talking to you,raj.

103
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,160
她什么意思?
what do you suppose she meant by that?

104
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,890
她是个迷 拉杰
She's an enigma,raj.

105
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,140
还有件事... 游戏规则是佩里一位
And another thing-- there's a certain ethic to the game,penny,a well

106
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,750
- 有着 ... - 她走了 谢尔顿
- established... - she's gone,sheldon.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,100
她至少该说声再见
Well,she could have said good-bye.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,440
我有麻烦了
Okay,I have a problem.

109
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,180
这个叫腕骨综合症 说实话你活该
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.

110
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
怎么了?
What's wrong?

111
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,760
呃 霍华德和克里斯汀好像...
Well,um,howard and christy are...

112
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,490
在我的卧室挺热乎的
kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,610
你确定?
Are you sure?

114
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,030
听着 我是在农场长大的
Look,I grew up on a farm,okay?

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,150
据我的经验 他们不是在做爱 就是霍华德被困在挤奶机里了
From what I heard,they're either having sex or howard's caught in a milking machine.

116
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,720
我能在这过夜吗?
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

117
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,020
没问题 你可以睡沙发 或者我的床
No,take the couch,or my bed.

118
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,410
我刚换了新枕头 低过敏型
I just got new pillows. Hypo-allergenic.

119
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,900
我睡沙发就好
The couch is good.

120
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,000
暂停一下 莱纳德 过来说话
Hold that thought. Leonard,a moment.

121
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,320
我猜 你有点意见
Let me guess. You have a problem with this.

122
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,430
从何说起呢?
Where do I begin?

123
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,650
随你 疯人的选择
It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

124
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,110
首先 我们的房间不留宿
Well,first,we don't have houseguests.

125
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,290
说实话 如果我付得起租金 早让你滚蛋了
Frankly,if I could afford the rent,I'd ask you to leave.

126
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,480
您的友谊对我意义重大 还有呢?
Your friendship means a lot to me as well. What else?

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,230
这个...
Well...

128
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,310
我们的地震补给啊 我们只有两人两天的储备
our earthquake supplies. We have a two-man,two-day kit.

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
所以呢?
So?

130
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,510
所以如果地震了 我们三个被困在这
So if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here,

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,420
我们明天下午就没东西吃了
we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,720
抱歉 你是说假如留佩里在这过夜 我们有可能被逼的自相残杀吗?
I'm sorry,are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,580
事情没发生 谁也说不准
No one ever thinks it'll happen until it does.

134
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,770
如你能保证不会乘睡觉时吃我们 就可以留下过夜
Penny,if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep,you can stay.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,710
什么?
What?

136
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,780
他在玩归谬法
He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

137
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,000
逻辑学中的一种驳斥形式 用以证明矛盾的或荒谬的结论
It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions

138
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,330
是按照前提推出的逻辑上必然的结果
and then criticizing the result.

139
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,740
我并不欣赏
And I do not appreciate it.

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,100
我给你拿毯子和枕头
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

141
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,960
好吧 我明显被无视 给你讲一下早晨的日程
Okay,well,since I'm obviously being ignored here,let's go over the morning schedule.

142
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,420
7:00到7:20 厕所归我用
I use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20.

143
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,650
因此计划一下你的清洁任务 和身体机能运作
Plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.

144
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,930
我怎么可能计划自己的身体机能运作?
How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,020
建议你晚上11点后不要喝水
I suggest no liquids after 11:00 P.M.

146
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,070
放这了
Here you go.

147
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,870
谢谢 莱纳德
Thanks,leonard.

148
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,440
错了
Wrong.

149
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,300
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

150
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,350
你头该朝这边
Your head goes on the other end.

151
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,010
为什么?
Why?

152
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,480
宇宙规律
It's culturally universal.

153
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,450
床 即使是临时的床
A bed,even a temporary bed,

154
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,260
都该床头朝向门口
is always oriented with the headboard away from the door.

155
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,960
是遵循古老的传统  防止自己被偷袭
It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.

156
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,020
我情愿冒险
I'll risk it.

157
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,710
还有什么要提醒的吗?
Anything else should I know?

158
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,660
如果你用了我牙刷 我会从这个窗口跳下去
Yes,if you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window.

159
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,070
请别来参加我的葬礼 祝您晚安
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,460
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

161
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,820
没关系
That's okay.

162
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,700
他的牙刷是紫外灯下树脂格子里红色的那个
Fyi-- his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglas case under the uv light.

163
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,970
明白
Got it.

164
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,940
睡塌实
Well,sleep tight.

165
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,710
谢谢
Thanks.

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,260
这么说还挺好玩的 睡塌实
Funny expression,"sleep tight."

167
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,310
这是因为早期床的结构
It refers to the early construction of beds

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,430
床垫被绳索吊起来 所以偶尔会...
which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes,which would occasionally...

169
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,740
睡塌实
sleep tight.

170
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,100
你干嘛呢?
what are you doing?

171
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,650
我们搬进来后每个周六早晨 我都在6:15准时醒来
Every saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15,

172
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,170
给自己冲一碗麦片
poured myself a bowl of cereal,

173
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,770
倒四分之一杯百分之二的牛奶
added a quarter cup of two percent milk,

174
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,370
坐在沙发的这边
sat on this end of this couch,

175
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,830
打开英国广播公司美国频道 看<神秘博士>
turned on bbc america,and watched doctor who.

176
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,950
佩里还睡着呢
Penny's still sleeping.

177
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,680
我们搬进来后每个周六早晨 我都在6:15准时醒来
Every saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15,

178
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,210
- 给自己冲一碗麦片... - 知道了 知道了
- poured myself a bowl of cereal... - I know,I know.

179
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
你自己房间有台电视
Look,you have a tv in your room.

180
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,210
你为什么不来个床上早餐呢?
Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?

181
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,130
因为我既不是残疾 也不是庆祝母亲节的妇女
Because I am neither an invalid,nor a woman celebrating mother's day.

182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,660
现在几点?
What time is it?

183
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,080
差不多6点半
Almost 6:30.

184
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,200
我睡了一整天?
I slept all day?

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,470
没有 是早上6点半
No,it's 6:30 in the morning.

186
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,250
你们有病吧?
What the hell is your problem?

187
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,590
太棒了 这碗麦片再不彼此分子独立了
Okay,this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity.

188
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
我现在有一碗麦片糊了
I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.

189
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,110
早安 我聪明的怪友们
Hola,nerd-migos.

190
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,420
大早上的怎么都不睡觉呢?
Why do you people hate sleep?

191
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,580
你穿着我的浴袍吗?
Are you wearing my robe?

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,260
是啊 抱歉 我会洗干净
Oh,yeah. Sorry,I'll have it cleaned.

193
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,830
没关系 你自己留着吧
That's okay,keep it.

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,550
克里斯汀呢?
Where's christy?

195
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,960
在洗澡
In the shower.

196
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,240
顺便问一句 你从哪买的丝瓜巾?
Oh,by the way,where did you get that loofah mitt?

197
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,570
能洗到死角哦
Yours reaches places that mine just won'T.

198
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,660
你用了我的丝瓜巾?
You used my loofah?

199
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,460
准确地说 是我俩用了
More precisely,we used your loofah.

200
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,420
我把她搓得欲仙欲死
I exfoliated her brains out.

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,390
这个也送给你了
You can keep that,too.

202
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,340
那么...我还想谈谈你的毛毛熊收藏
Well,then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.

203
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,990
霍华德?
Howard?

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,860
在这里 宝贝!
In here,milady!

205
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,720
我的小火车在这里
There's my little engine that could.

206
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,910
卡嚓 卡嚓...
Chugga-ghugga,chugga-chugga...

207
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,870
我再也不会看这本书了 (畅销童话: <小火车做到了>)
Well,there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.

208
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,070
嗨 我是克里斯汀
Hi. Christy.

209
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
莱纳德
Leonard.

210
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,180
我是谢尔顿
I'm sheldon.

211
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,890
对 你们是霍华德的随从
Right. You're howard's entourage.

212
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,900
克里斯汀 你打算怎么安排?
Uh,so,christy,what are your plans?

213
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,530
霍华德说带我去比佛利山购物
Oh,well,howard said he'd take me shopping in beverly hills.

214
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,640
不是 我的意思是你的住处
Yeah,no,I meant plans to find someplace to live.

215
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,390
除了我这里
You know,other than with me.

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,380
我不是不欢迎你...
Not that I don't love having you,but it'S...

217
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,270
只是有点挤
it's a little crowded.

218
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,570
佩里 你想过来随时都可以啊
You know,penny,you're always welcome to stay with us.

219
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,200
太好了
Oh,terrific.

220
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,720
把这里当小旅店了
Now we're running a cute little b & B.

221
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,660
我作为局外人提个建议
Let me offer a little outside-the-box thinking here.

222
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,490
克里斯汀可以跟我住
Why doesn't christy stay with me?

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
首先 你住你妈家
For one thing,you live with your mother.

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,790
不是的
I do not.

225
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,680
是我妈住我家
My mother lives with me.

226
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,560
这样安排很好
Well,then it's all settled.

227
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,040
克里斯汀住霍华德那里 佩里回自己房间
Christy will stay with howard,penny can go back to her apartment,

228
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,910
我还有24分钟的<神秘博士>可看
and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who.

229
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,290
不过现在只能说是 <看不看没所谓博士>了
Although at this point,it's more like doctor why bother?

230
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,520
谢尔顿 你不能这么独裁...
Sheldon,you just can't dictate...

231
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,860
不要说话 全都走!
no more talking! Everybody go!

232
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,980
你怎么样?
So what do you say?

233
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,650
我们去沃罗威茨之家修缮一下吧?
Want to repair to casa wolowitz?

234
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,280
什么地方? 墨西哥快餐店?
What is that,like a mexican deli?

235
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,400
不好意思 之前没告诉你
I'm sorry,I should have mentioned this earlier.

236
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,540
我姓沃罗威茨
My last name is wolowitz.

237
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,440
哇 有意思
Oh,that's so cool.

238
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,560
我的第一个犹太人
My first jew.

239
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,670
我猜内布拉斯加州没多少剥玉米皮的犹太佬
I imagine there aren't very many kosher cornhuskers.
Kosher:犹太教所允许的
Cornhusker:美国内布拉斯加州居民的绰号(意为剥玉米皮的乡巴佬)

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
你会带我去购物吧?
But you're still taking me shopping,right?

241
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,320
那是当然
Anything you want.

242
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,850
好的 我去拿行李
Okay,I'll go pack my stuff.

243
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,460
待克隆人技术成熟时 我要订购一打这样的
When they perfect human cloning,I'm going to order 12 of those.

244
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,970
霍华德 你看不出来她在利用你吗?
Howard,can't you see she's using you?

245
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,270
管她呢? 昨晚她脱下睡衣 我激动得都哭了
Who cares? Last night,she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,300
霍华德 我了解她 懂吗?
Look,howard,I know her. Okay?

247
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,080
谁给她买东西 她就跟谁上床
She'll have sex with anyone,as long as they keep buying her things.

248
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,620
- 真的? - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

249
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,090
真的!
Yay!

250
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,910
失陪了 我要去兑换我的成人礼金券
If you'll excuse me,I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

251
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,050
很抱歉 没有沃罗威茨我们没法吃
I'm sorry,we cannot do this without wolowitz.

252
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,150
没有沃罗威茨我们就不能吃中餐?
We can't order chinese food without wolowitz?

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,490
我跟你解释
Let me walk you through it.

254
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,410
我们是这么点的 头道蒸饺 然后左宗棠鸡
Our standard order is: The steamed dumpling appetizer,general tso's chicken,

255
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,130
西兰花牛柳 龙舟活鱼和素菜捞面
beef with broccoli,shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein.

256
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,460
发现问题了吧
Do you see the problem?

257
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,810
我看到 一个问题
I see a problem.

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,200
我们整个的点菜是建立在点四只蒸饺
Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings

259
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,910
四道小菜、四个人分着吃的基础上的
and four entrees divided amongst four people.

260
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,210
那就只要三道菜好了
So,we'll just order three entrees.

261
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,660
好 那么舍弃哪道?
Fine. What do you want to eliminate?

262
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,590
多出的一个蒸饺给谁?
And who gets the extra dumpling?

263
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,110
可以切成三份
We could cut it into thirds.

264
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,370
那就不是饺子了
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

265
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,530
当你把它切开以后就是开口的小三明治了
Once you cut it open it is,at best,a very small open-faced sandwich.

266
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,390
你们好
Hi,fellas.

267
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,620
那个自以为会说普通话的人没来?
Oh,where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin?

268
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,490
他把自己的利益置于集体利益之前
He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.

269
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,750
在这位老兄的家乡 那可是死罪
Where he comes from,that's punishable by death.

270
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,350
我是萨克拉门托人
I come from sacramento.

271
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,840
可不可以只要三个蒸饺?
Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?

272
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,760
不可替换
No substitutions.

273
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,390
这不是替换 是减量
This isn't a substitution. It's a reduction.

274
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,890
- 好吧 不准减量 - 行
- Okay.No reductions. - Fine.

275
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,990
那我们要三笼蒸饺
Uh,bring us three orders of dumplings.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,810
一共十二个 每人四个
That's 12. We'll each have four.

277
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,360
可以
That works.

278
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,400
不行 如果吃饺子吃饱了 就要再减一道菜
No. If we fill up on dumplings,we need to eliminate another entree.

279
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,530
不准减菜
No eliminations.

280
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,570
多处来的就打包好了
If we have extra,we'll just take the leftovers home.

281
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,400
然后怎么分?
And divide it how?

282
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,250
跟你说 没沃罗威茨就是不行
I'm telling you,we cannot do this without wolowitz.

283
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,910
沃罗威茨和新女朋友在一起
Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend.

284
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,620
要不是你不让我请佩里 现在正好四个人
If you had let me invite penny,then you would have had your fourth.

285
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,280
你见过佩里怎么吃中国菜吗?
Have you seen penny eat chinese food?

286
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,480
她拿叉子吃 还把蛋卷蘸两次
She uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls.

287
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,880
我们又没点蛋卷
We don't order egg rolls.

288
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,180
是的 但她来了就会点蛋卷了!
Exactly,but we'd have to if she was here!

289
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,590
能不能快点决定?
Can we please make a decision?

290
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,390
不仅仅在印度有孩子在挨饿
Not only are there children starving in india,

291
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,790
眼前就有个印度人在挨饿
there's an indian starving right here.

292
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,670
要我说 不如去吃印度餐吧?
There's an idea. Why don't we just go out for indian food?

293
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,520
看你们几个人不错
You're nice boys.

294
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,020
告诉你我的办法
Tell you what I'm going to do.

295
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,110
我给你们上四个饺子
I'm going to bring you the four dumplings.

296
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,990
当我送上来的时候
When I'm walking over to the table,

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,890
也许我绊一下 碰掉一个饺子
maybe I get bumped,one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

298
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
你们什么都不知道
No one has to know.

299
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,820
我知道
I'll know.

300
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,970
汤怎么样?
how about soup?

301
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,470
汤总归是好分的
Yeah,we can always divide soup.

302
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,680
馄饨怎么分?
What about the wontons?

303
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,200
嗨 怎么啦?
Hey,guys,what's up?

304
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,210
今晚是光晕游戏之夜
It's halo night.

305
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,360
啊? 是啊
Yeah? Okay.

306
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,820
怎么?
So?

307
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,400
因为沃罗威茨在陪你朋友克里斯汀
Well,with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christy...

308
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,370
她不是我朋友
she's not my friend.

309
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,550
朋友是不会让朋友心爱的小熊全身是水的
Friends do not get their friends' care bears all sweaty.

310
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,360
没错 但是沃罗威茨没空
Right. Anyway,uh,with wolowitz occupied elsewhere,

311
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,090
我们要请你帮个忙
we had something we wanted to ask you.

312
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,000
- 谢尔顿? - 来了
- Sheldon? - Yes.

313
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,040
佩里...
penny...

314
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,410
我们很荣幸的邀请你
we would very much appreciate

315
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,380
加入我们成为光晕战队的第四名成员
it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team.

316
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,380
我想不说你也明白 这是多大的荣耀
I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.

317
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,800
你们真好 但是今晚我和朋友去跳舞
Oh,that's so sweet,but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.

318
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,360
你不能走 这是光晕之夜
You can't go out; it's halo night.

319
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,210
在佩里看来 这是跳舞之夜
Well,for penny,it's dancing night.

320
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,710
你每周三晚上都跳舞?
You go dancing every wednesday?

321
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,810
- 不 - 那就不能称跳舞之夜
No. Then that's not "dancing night."

322
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,290
明天陪你们玩好不好?
Look,why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?

323
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,520
光晕之夜在今晚
Tonight is halo night.

324
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,630
好像跟墙壁说话似的
It's like talking to a wall.

325
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,210
谢尔顿 别惹我发火
All right,now,sheldon,you and I are about to have a problem.

326
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,610
谢尔顿 不是早都套好了台词吗?
Sheldon,remember,we role-played this.

327
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,670
但是你扮的她没这么不讲理
Yes,but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.

328
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,880
好了 我得走了
All right,fellas,I gotta go.

329
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,970
祝你们好运
But good luck.

330
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,370
也许我们可以问她 愿不愿带我们一起去跳舞
Maybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.

331
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,610
假设我们会跳舞 其实不会
Okay,assuming we could dance-- which we can't--

332
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,040
我们三个男生 两个女生
there are three of us and two of them.

333
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:47,760
怎么?
So?

334
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,970
又是中餐馆的难题
It's the chinese restaurant all over again.

335
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,000
我向你保证 把饺子切成三份还算简单了
I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play

336
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,990
每个人跟67%的女人跳舞才叫难
compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.

337
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,710
得了谢尔顿 快被你逼疯了!
Oh,for god's sakes,sheldon,you're driving me crazy!

338
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,770
你不是气我 你是气基础数学
Your anger is not with me,sir,but with basic mathematics.

339
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,760
不 我十分肯定就是气你
No. I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

340
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,810
我们这是怎么了 分崩离析
What's happening to us? We're falling apart.

341
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,370
给谁打?
Who are you calling?

342
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,700
只有他才能给我们的宇宙带来平衡
The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.

343
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,460
嗨 我是霍华德 沃罗威茨
Hi,this is howard wolowitz.

344
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,150
我是克里斯汀 范德贝尔特
And this is christy vanderbelt.

345
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,840
我们不能接电话 因为在做爱!
We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!

346
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,130
你不会真把这个放在答录机上吧?
You're not going to put that on your message,are you?

347
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,230
不会 我说说的 等下重录
Nah,I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

348
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,490
谢尔顿 想清楚了
sheldon,think this through.

349
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,730
你这是让霍华德在性爱和光晕中做抉择
You're going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo.

350
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,940
不 是性爱和光晕3之间的抉择
No,I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and halo three.

351
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,680
据我所知 人类性爱还没升级到
As far as I know,sex has not been upgraded

352
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,300
高清晰图像以及增强版武器系统装备
to include hi-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.

353
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,660
说的对 做爱有什么了不起 无非是裸体性高潮和人类接触
You're right,all sex has is nudity,orgasms and human contact.

354
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,080
就是说嘛
My point.

355
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,740
我说 能不能别在沙发上盖塑料布!
I'm just saying,you can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while!

356
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,870
好方便你和霍华德叉叉?
Why,so you and howard can hump on it?

357
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,220
女士们 我想一定有折衷的
Ladies,ladies,I'm sure there's a middle ground.

358
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,580
闭嘴 霍华德
Shut up,howard!

359
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,780
这样吧 你们慢聊
You know what,you guys talk.

360
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,120
我骑车出去转一圈
I'm gonna take my scooter out for a little spin.

361
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,510
你开心了? 你把儿子赶出家门
You happy? You drove your own son out of the house.

362
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,550
你们在这里做什么?
hey,what are you guys doing here?

363
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,590
今天是光晕之夜
It's halo night.

364
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,350
他不算男人 他是傻小子
He's not a man,he's a putz!

365
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,810
你这个拜金女别跟我那种口气!
And don't you take that tone with me,you gold digger!

366
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,720
你说我什么?
What'd you call me?

367
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,730
你听到了
You heard me!

368
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,910
我跟你明说吧 你勾搭错人了
And I'll tell you something else,you're barking up the wrong tree.

369
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,190
只要你在 遗嘱就没他份!
'Cause as long as you're around,howard is out of the will!

370
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,960
知道吗? 我有更好的主意
You know what? I got better offers.

371
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,580
我走了
I'm outta here.

372
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,310
对了
that's right.

373
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,270
滚回巴比伦 骚货
Go back to babylon,you whore!
巴比伦常指奢华淫靡的城市

374
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,590
光晕之夜是吧?
So,halo night,huh?

375
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,000
我还以为她是从奥马哈来的
I thought she was the whore of omaha.

376
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,970
谢尔顿 他在你的视野里! 开火!
sheldon,you got him in your sights! Fire!

377
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,750
他正在给电浆枪充电!
He's charging his plasma rifle!

378
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,500
我不能开枪
I can't shoot now.

379
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,320
我隐身状态!
I'm cloaking!

380
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,730
拉杰! 干掉谢尔顿!
Now,raj! Kill sheldon!

381
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,760
我看不见他!
I can't see him!

382
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,260
所以这叫隐身! 死人
That's why they call it cloaking,dead man!

383
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,760
开始扔手榴弹!
Start throwing grenades!

384
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,490
扔光了!
I'm all out!

385
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,060
嗨 伙计们 我朋友不想跳舞了
Hey,guys. My friends and I got tired of dancing,

386
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,780
所以来找你们做爱
so we came over to have sex with you.

387
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,230
拉杰 跳进坦克里!
Raj,hop in the tank!

388
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,150
不是说不带坦克的吗!
We said no tanks!

389
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,680
地狱级没有规则!
There are no rules in hell!

390
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,500
该死的 血包!
Son of a bitch. Med pack!

391
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,560
我要血包!
I need a med pack!

392
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,100
跟你们说了
Told ya.

393
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,250
有狙击手! 用火箭筒!
There's a sniper. Use your rocket launcher!

394
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,900
我只有一把针刺枪! 还没子弹了
All I've got is a needler and I'm all out of ammo!

395
