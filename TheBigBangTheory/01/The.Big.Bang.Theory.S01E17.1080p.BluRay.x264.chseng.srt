1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,440
我 的 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de zing shi sheldon.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,850
不  应该是
Non, c'est...

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,950
我 的 名 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de ming zi shi sheldon.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,830
我 的 名 字 是谢尔顿
Wo de ming zi shi sheldon.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,570
这算什么?
What's this?

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,740
你不是这么做的嘛
That's what you did.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,900
我以为在某些语言里
I assumed, as in a number of languages,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,610
手势也是表达的一部分
That the gesture was part of the phrase.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
不是
Well, it's not.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,440
我又怎么知道?  作为老师  你有义务
How am I supposed to know that? as the teacher, it's your obligation

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,620
把个人习惯从教学过程中排除
To separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,580
你知道  我真的很高兴你决定学习普通话
You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn mandarin.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,190
-为什么?  -一旦你学得溜了
-why? -once you're fluent,

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,040
你就又多了十几亿的人去烦  我就解放了
You'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,340
梅毒驴子
Mei du lui zi.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,910
你刚才叫莱纳德是个得了梅毒的驴子
You just called leonard a syphilitic donkey.

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,850
向你道歉
My apologies,

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,920
我的水平只是和老师一样好
I'm only as good as my teacher.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,740
你为什么要学中文?
Why are you learning chinese?

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,140
我认为四川菜馆故意用
I believe the szechuan palace has been passing off

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,690
香橙鸡丁来假冒陈皮鸡丁  所以我要去对峙
Orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,850
如果我是你  我会更关心
If I were you, I'd be more concerned

23
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,900
他们是拿什么假冒了鸡丁
About what they are passing off as chicken.

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,620
-我要用一下你们的窗户  -随意
-i need to use your window. -sure, go ahead.

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,240
不要脸的  你落了ipod
Hey, jerk face, you forgot your ipod!

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,960
-怎么了这是  -我来告诉你这是怎么了
-what's going on? -i'll tell you what's going on.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,690
那自恋的蠢蛋把我们的性生活写进了博客里
That stupid self-centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog.

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,870
去死吧  你个自恋的蠢蛋!
Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard!

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,280
谢谢
Thank you.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,310
好吧  我们讲到哪儿了
Okay, where were we?

31
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,810
别急  我要先搜索一个博客
Not now, I have a blog to find.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,580
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第17集（本季终）
The.Tangerine.Factor

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,090
佩妮  你还好吧
Penny, are you okay?

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,160
我很好  莱纳德  你走吧
I'm fine, leonard. just go away!

35
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,700
我知道分手会让人很难过...
I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful...

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,950
-给我走!  -好吧  开心点  再见
-go away! -okay, feel better! bye!

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,380
她不想说话
She doesn't want to talk.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,680
没什么惊讶的  佩妮的情感来自于
Not surprising. penny's emotional response is originated

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,520
最原始的脑部  也就是扁桃形结构
In the primitive portion of the brain, known as the amygdala.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
然而话语功能处于最后发育的
While speech is centered in the

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,550
新大脑皮质中心位置
Much more recently developed neo-cortex.

42
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,600
前者可以轻易统治后者
The former can easily overpower the latter,

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,130
科学已经证实这就是
Giving scientific credence to

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,860
"无话可说"的概念
The notion of being "rendered speechless."

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,120
或者她就是不想说话
Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,620
看  我捡到了一个ipod
Look, I found an ipod!

47
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,420
都摔得不成样子了  你打算怎么处理
It's smashed beyond repair. what are you gonna do with it?

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,730
还能怎么办  贴个"九成新"的标签上eBay卖了
What else? sell it on ebay as "slightly used."

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,900
是佩妮男朋友的  他们分手了
It was penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,350
很显然  他把他们私人生活的细节放在了
Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,720
他的博客上  可我却怎么都找不到
On his blog which I cannot find anywhere.

52
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,920
我要回去再试着和她聊聊
I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,750
好主意  坐在她身旁
Good idea, sit with her.

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,230
抱着她  安慰她
Hold her, comfort her.

55
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,040
如果你觉得时机不错
And if the moment feels right,

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,010
看看可不可以趁虚而入
See if you can cop a feel.

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,180
我才不会趁人之危  霍华德
I'm not going to do that, howard.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,660
我倒完全没意识到现在
I'm not aware of a new social

59
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,010
有什么要求你进行干预和调解的社交习俗
Convention that requires you to intervene at all.

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,950
那么处在痛苦中的少女呢
What about damsel in distress?
1937年上映美国电影 歌舞/爱情/喜剧

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,310
12世纪骑士的行为准则?  又不是现在
Twelfth century code of chivalry? not exactly current.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,630
你还必须要先成为骑士才可以这么做
You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,240
我才不管  她很难过  我要过去
I don't care. she's upset, I'm going over there.

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,250
记得在手上坐一会  让它们暖和一点
Remember to sit on your hands a bit, so they're warm.

65
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,540
我是她朋友
I'm her friend.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,930
我不会在她正脆弱的时候去利用她
I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.

67
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,030
你的意思是  如果在绝望之极时
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair,

68
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,600
她主动向你投怀送抱
She throws herself at you and demands you take her,

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,190
当时当下  你就头不回走人?
Right there, right now, you'll just walk away?

70
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,170
我说我是她朋友  又不是同志朋友
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

71
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,770
听着  我知道你不想说话...
Listen, I know you said you didn't want to talk...

72
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,330
-我不想  -对不起
-i don't. -sorry.

73
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,090
-等等  -等等?  你说"等等"?
-wait! -wait? did you say "wait"?

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,760
跟我说实话
Tell me the truth.

75
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,170
我是不是那种整天跟大混蛋在一起的傻瓜
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

76
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,550
那么我就是跟好人在一起  然后把他们都变成了混蛋
So I pick good guys but turn them into losers.

77
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,180
当然不是
of course not.

78
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,890
非此即彼  到底是哪个
It's gotta be one or the other. which is it?

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,100
抱歉  是哪两个选项来着?
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?

80
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,400
我真的以为麦克与众不同
I really thought mike was different.

81
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,820
我以为他...
I thought he was...

82
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,680
体贴  又聪明
Sensitive and smart,

83
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,940
我不是指你那种聪明  是普通不吓人的那种
I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,700
是  是  当然
Yeah, no, sure.

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,230
现在他跑过来羞辱我
And then he just goes and has to humiliate me

86
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,790
在博客上写些关于我的东西让全世界的人来看
By writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.

87
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,430
跟你说吧  那博客不容易被找到的
I tell you, it's not all that easy to find.

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,910
真的?  跟我要好的同事看到了  我姐姐看到了
Really? my friends at work found it, my sister found it.

89
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,950
从电子邮件来看  一些在密歇根州
Judging by my email, a number of prisoners

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,590
监狱里的牢犯也看到了
At the michigan state penitentiary found it.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,010
那家伙究竟写了什么
What exactly did this guy write?

92
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,680
我不是说想知道你性生活的细节  只是想...
Not that I need to know the details of your sex life. I just thought...

93
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,830
算了
Never mind.

94
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,020
不用
No, you know what?

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,340
你可以去看  所有人都看了  去吧
You might as well read it. everybody else has. go ahead.

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,230
上帝  我感觉被如此地出卖和羞辱
Oh, god, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed!

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,120
只想钻进洞里然后死去
I just want to crawl into a hole and die!

98
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,280
你看  这其实没那么糟糕
Okay. well, you know, this isn't that bad.

99
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,240
只是描绘了一幅
It just paints the picture

100
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,210
浓情蜜意的女人
Of a very affectionate woman,

101
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,780
在非传统地点场合
Who's open to expressing her affection

102
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,420
开放地表达她的情感
In non-traditional locales.

103
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,020
天啊
Oh, god!

104
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,510
电梯里  公园里
Elevators, parks,

105
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,020
电影院里
Movie theaters.

106
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,070
好奇问一下
Out of curiosity,

107
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,300
这里的"地铁"是指交通运输系统
Is this "subway" the transportation system

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,350
还是那个叫"地铁"的三明治店?
Or subway the sandwich shop?

109
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,740
三明治店
Sandwich shop.

110
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,770
这是不是违反了卫生许可啊
Doesn't that violate the health code?

111
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,310
没有  在那里我们只是亲热了一下
No, at the sub shop we were only making out.

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,440
我是想说
But my point is that

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,030
你完全没有理由觉得尴尬啊
You have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.

114
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,150
真的吗?  你是不是认为我反应太过了?
Really? do you think I overreacted?

115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,430
-可能有一点  -我确实经常这样  我是个容易过激的人
-maybe a little. -because I do that. I do overreact.

116
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,450
也许我应该打电话跟麦克道歉
Maybe I should call mike and apologize.

117
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,830
你这样反应就变成太不过了
That would be under-reacting.

118
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,890
他确实把卧室里的隐私都暗示出来了
He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom.

119
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,010
在你的橱里  电梯  公园  还有在快餐店
And in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.

120
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,970
你说得对  我就应该说"我跟他玩完了"
You're right. I should just say "i am done with him."

121
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,930
对  你就该这么说  说吧
Yes, you should. go ahead, say it.

122
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,180
但是我还没有给这个男人解释的机会
But I never gave the man a chance to explain.

123
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,170
有什么好解释的
What is there to explain?

124
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,430
都写在这里了
It's all right here.

125
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,090
出卖啊!
The betrayal!

126
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,220
不  你一开始是对的
No, you were right the first time.

127
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,630
这个男人只是用他自己那种很傻的办法爱着我
This is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way,

128
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,280
只是在向世人宣告他的感受
Which is trying to sw w people how he feels.

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,680
我很肯定我没这么说
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,530
是  你做得更了不起
No, you did better than that.

131
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,250
你让我自己发现了这个事实
You helped me see it on my own.

132
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,870
我真棒啊
Oh, good for me.

133
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,640
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

134
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,080
我去麦克那儿
I'm going over to mike's.

135
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,460
莱纳德  太感谢你了
Leonard, thank you so much.

136
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,490
没事
Oh, sure.

137
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,330
也许我真是她的同性恋朋友
Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,830
霍华德  我想我还需要继续上中文课
Howard, I'm going to nd d another mandarin lesson.

139
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
很显然  那些人还是
I obviously didn't make

140
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,860
听不懂我在说什么
My point with those people.

141
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,930
谢尔顿  看在老天的份上
For god's sake, sheldon,

142
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,530
如果你不喜欢陈皮鸡丁
If you don't like the ngngerine chicken,

143
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,270
就不要点陈皮鸡丁
Don't order the tangerine chicken.

144
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,500
我喜欢吃陈皮鸡丁
I like tangerine chicken,

145
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,650
只是他们给我的压根不是陈皮鸡丁
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

146
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,160
能不能聊点别的?
Can we please change the subject?

147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,050
当然
Sure.

148
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,270
我们聊聊你是怎么
Ll us again how you screwed up

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,370
让佩妮回到她前男友身边的吧
And got penny back together witherer old boyfriend.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,450
扔你的骰子
Just roll the dice.

151
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,590
"被魔术师俘虏
"enslaved by warlocks.

152
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,290
只有掷出二  四  六才可以离开"
Stay here until you roll two, four or six."

153
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,250
她本来在生他的气的!
She was mad at him!

154
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,920
她本来跟他玩完了!
She was done with him!

155
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,710
这段感情已经是不可能挽回的了
E e relationship was broken beyond repair,

156
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,200
而我跑过去  让他们和好了
And I walked over there, and I fixed it.

157
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,580
天啊  这个故事真是越听越精彩...
Boy, that story gets better every time you hear ..

158
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,750
实际上  我觉得前两个版本
Actually, I thought the first two renditions

159
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,910
要吸引人得多
Were far more compelling.

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,670
之前  我对那个叫莱纳德的角色是报以同情
Previously, I felt sympathy for the leonard character,

161
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,130
现在我只是觉得他很怨妇
Now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.

162
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,010
吃你的陈皮鸡丁去
Eat your tangerine chicken.

163
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,130
我也想吃啊  可我这根本不是陈皮鸡丁
I'd love to, but I don' have tangerine chicken.

164
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,090
非常感谢你愚蠢的建议!
Thank you so much for your stupid advice!

165
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,860
不可思议
Incredible.

166
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,500
你把搞砸的事情又搞砸了
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

167
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,150
我又来了
I'm back.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,990
对不起  刚才我吼你了
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

169
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,340
又不是你的错
It's not your fault.

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,150
怎么啦
What happened?

171
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,440
我去麦克那想跟他和好
Well, I went over to mike's to make up with him.

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,250
是  不用说  我知道这部分
Yeah. no, I know that part.

173
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,520
但他已经有新欢了
But he had already moved on.

174
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,180
已经?  好快啊
Already? that was quick.

175
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,480
我就是这么对
That's what I said to the woman

176
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,680
那个把脚缠在他脖子上的女人说的
Who had her legs wrapped around his neck!

177
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,580
佩妮  我也很难过
Oh, penny, I am so sorry.

178
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,010
他怎么能这样?!
How could he do that?!

179
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,410
你要知道  你把他80G的IPOD给了...
Well, you know, you did throw an 80-gig ipod...

180
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,870
对呀  他怎么能这样对你
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

181
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,400
我发誓我再也不跟这样的男人交往了
I swear to god I am done with guys like that.

182
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,430
那种身材好  发型帅  有钱的男人
You know, macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money.

183
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,210
是  他们肯定老得很快
Yeah, that must get old quick.

184
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,270
你知道吗  这一次
You know, just once

185
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,050
我真的想和一个
I would like to go out with someone

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,970
善良诚实  真正关心我的人约会
Who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.

187
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,840
我怎么样?
What about me?

188
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,100
你什么怎么样?
What about you what?

189
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,980
你和我约会怎么样?
What about if you went out with me?

190
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,370
你是在约我出去?
Are you asking me out?

191
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,250
是  我是
Um, yes, I am...

192
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,760
在约你出去
Asking you out.

193
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,990
我只是顺着你的话在说...
I was just going off your comment about the nice guy...

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,660
-我明白  -诚实啊什么的
No, I know, I got that. you know, and honest.

195
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,380
对啊
Yeah, totally.

196
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,830
...没有什么的
So, but... it's no big deal.

197
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,860
好
Yes.

198
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,240
好什么?
Yes what?

199
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,180
好  我愿意和你去约会
Yes, I will go out with you.

200
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,020
真的吗?
Really?

201
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,300
是
Yeah.

202
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,290
有什么不可以的
Why not?

203
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,670
我已经倾尽所有了
I mean, what do I have to lose?

204
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,170
确实
Yeah.

205
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,550
就该这样想
That's the spirit.

206
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,410
给我看你们的陈皮
Show me your citrus peels.

207
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,920
给我看你们的陈皮
Gay wo k n ni de jud zi pee.

208
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,370
给我看你们的陈皮
Show me your citrus peels.

209
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,810
给我看你们的陈皮
Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.

210
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,560
-给我看你们的  -谢尔顿?
Show me your... sheldon?

211
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,870
哎呀  吓死我了
Ai yah!xia si wo le

212
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,040
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,220
你有时间吗(second还有次等的意思)
Look, do you have a second?

214
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,560
次等的什么  内衣?
A second what, pair of underwear?

215
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,330
我是在问你是否有空和我聊聊
I was just wondering if I could talk to you.

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,660
是关于莱纳德
It's about leonard.

217
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,990
为什么和我聊
Why me?

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,210
为什么不和库萨帕里或者沃尔维茨聊
Why not koothrappali or wolowitz?

219
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,960
拉杰不能和我说话  除非他喝醉了
Well, raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk,

220
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,590
而沃尔维茨  你知道的  他令人恶心
And wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

221
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,600
是的  我也这么认为
Yes, I suppose he is

222
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,210
我想说的是  你最了解莱纳德了
All I'm saying is, you know leordrd the best.

223
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,410
不一定
Not necessarily.

224
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,760
我常会惊讶于
I'm often surprised

225
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,630
自己对莱纳德了解的匮乏
By my lack of familiarity with leonard.

226
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,140
前几天我发现
Just the other day I discovered

227
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,780
他不仅有丝瓜络
He not only has a loofah,

228
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,340
而且还藏起来
He hides it.

229
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,480
你说为什么一个男人会为使用丝瓜络而感到羞耻
Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?

230
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,410
我个人来说  更乐于让自己的上皮细胞
I, myself, prefer to have my excess epithelial cells

231
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,700
自然脱落  但是我也不责备
Slough off naturally, but I d't condemn

232
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,570
那些试图加速这个过程的人
Those who seek to accelerate the process.

233
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,640
...而且直到最近我才知道
...and until recently I had no idea

234
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,590
尽管他对乳糖过敏
That despite his lactose intolerance,

235
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,520
但他吃少量不含脂的冰淇淋
He can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream

236
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,730
却不会产生在我看来
Without producing a noxious gas that I maintain,

237
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,020
如果适当浓缩  可以成为生化武器的有毒气体
In the right concentration, could be weaponize

238
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,160
莱纳德可能会回来
Leonard might come home.

239
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,680
能去我屋里聊吗
Can we talk in my apartment?

240
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,160
我们还没聊完?
We're not done?

241
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,340
没有
No.

242
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,570
那好吧
Eh, why not?

243
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,620
反正我们已经穿过镜子了(源于"爱丽丝镜中奇遇记")
We're already through the looking glass anyway.

244
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,930
好  事情是这样的
Okay, so here's the thing...

245
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,470
我想你已经知道  莱纳德向我开口了
I guess you're aware that leonard asked me out.

246
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,630
他虽然事实上什么都没有说
Well, he didn't actually say anything,

247
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,230
但他回到房间后
But when he came back to the apartment

248
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,210
跳起了一支让人能联想起
He was doing a dance that brought to mind

249
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,970
幻想曲里那只开心河马的舞蹈
The happy hippos in fantasia.

250
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,740
他真好
Oh, that's nice.

251
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,380
无论如何  我想和你说的是
Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about

252
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,600
你知道  自从我和莱纳德成为朋友以来...
Is, you know, since leonard and I have become friends...

253
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,890
我只是...
I was just...

254
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,720
你要坐下来吗
You want to sit down?

255
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,990
能那样简单就好了
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

256
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,580
我没在这里待过多久
See, I don't spend much time here,

257
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,170
所以我还从来没有选过一个地方来坐
And so I've never really chosen a place to sit.

258
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,360
那选吧
Well, choose.

259
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,350
这里有许许多多的选择  而且...
There are a number of options, and...

260
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,850
我真的不够熟悉座垫的密度
I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities,

261
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,190
气流模式和阳光的散射
Air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight

262
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,780
来以便做出一个理性的选择
To make an informed choice.

263
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,970
好吧  那你就任意选一处坐
All right.why don't you just pick one at random

264
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,190
如果你不喜欢  下次来再换一个地方
And if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,610
不  不  那样太疯狂了
No, no. that's crazy.

266
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,180
你继续说  我一边听一边找
You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.

267
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,190
好吧
Okay.

268
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,570
是这样的
Um, here's the thing.

269
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,190
我已经知道
So I've known for a while now

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
莱纳德他有点
That leonard has had

271
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,030
喜欢我...
A little crush on me...

272
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,750
有点喜欢?
A little crush?

273
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,080
我想是的...就像斯巴达王墨涅劳斯
Well, I suppose so--in the same way menelaus

274
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,100
有点喜欢特洛伊的海伦一样
Had a "little crush" on helen of troy.

275
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,510
好吧  我不知道这些人是谁  但...
All right, yeah, I don't really know who they are, but...

276
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,130
墨涅劳斯是阿迦门农的兄弟...
Well, menelaus was the brother of agamemnon...

277
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,960
不用了  不用了  听着
I don't care. I don't care. listen.

278
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,680
我要说的是
The point is,

279
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,910
莱纳德不是那种经常会和我约会的人
Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.

280
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,710
莱纳德不是那种经常会和任何人约会的人
Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.

281
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,180
你是否介意把沙发顺时针旋转30度
Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

282
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,190
不行  我想说的是
No. what I'm saying is

283
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,200
莱纳德与其他人不同可能是件好事
Leonard might be different in a good way.

284
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,420
很明显  我平时的选择都不怎么的好
Obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.

285
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,470
你上一个对库萨帕里来说很好
Your last one worked out well for koothrappali.

286
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,910
他得到了一个免费的ipod
He got a free ipod.

287
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,860
刺眼
Oh, glare.

288
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,250
但换个角度来说  如果和莱纳德进展不顺利
On the other hand, if things don't go well with leonard,

289
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,430
我可能会失去一个很好的朋友
I risk losing a really good friend.

290
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,390
我意思是  他不会是一时放纵的人
I mean, I'm guessing he's not looking for a fling.

291
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,250
他是那种陷入一段感情后会持续
He's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship

292
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,740
我不知道  可能你会说  光年
For, I don't know, like you would say, light years.

293
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,140
我不会那么说
I would not say that.

294
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:22,860
没有人
No one

295
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,580
会那么说
Would say that.

296
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,300
光年是一个距离单位而不是一个时间单位
A light year is a unit of distance not time.

297
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,530
谢谢你的说明
Thank you for the clarification.

298
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,090
通风口
Draft.

299
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,990
人们听到年这个词的时候
See, people hear the word "year"

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,340
他们想到的是持续的一段时间
And they think duration.

301
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,190
"尺磅"也有这样的问题...
"foot-pound" has the same problem--

302
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,140
它是一个能量单位  而不是一个重量单位
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

303
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,350
没错  谢谢
Right. thanks.

304
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,340
这是常识性错误
It's common mistake.

305
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,280
这不是我今天犯的第一个错了
Not the first one I've made today.

306
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,770
好
Okay.

307
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,280
我觉得这就是我的座位了
I think this will be my seat.

308
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,980
谢尔顿  你有什么可以说的吗
Sheldon, do you have anything to say

309
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,460
任何内容  你知道
That has anything to do with, you know,

310
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,180
只要和我在说的有关的
What I'm talking about?

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,260
好  让我想想
Well, let's see...

312
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,490
我们也许可以参考"薛定谔猫"
We might cononsider schrodinger's cat.

313
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,290
薛定谔
Schrodinger?

314
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,580
是住2楼A座的那个女人吗
Is that the woman in 2a?

315
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,060
不  那位是格洛辛格女士
No, that's mrs. grossinger.

316
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,170
并且她不养猫  她养的是一只墨西哥无毛犬
And she doesn't have a cat, she has a mexican hairless.

317
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,690
超烦人的一种小动物
Annoying little animal. yip, yip, yip, yip.

318
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,220
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

319
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,800
对不起  你又让我跑题了
Sorry, you diverted me.

320
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,620
在1935年  埃尔文·薛定谔
Anyway, in 1935, erwin schrodinger,

321
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,050
尝试去说明在量子物理学中的
In an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation

322
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,990
哥本哈根解释
Of quantum physics,

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,320
他做了个实验
He proposed an experimen

324
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,230
把一只猫和一小瓶密封好的毒药一起放在盒子里
Where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison

325
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,130
毒药瓶随时会破裂
That will break open at a random time.

326
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,960
好  除非你打开盒子
Now, since no one knows when

327
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,060
不然没人知道毒药是否
Or if the poison has been released,

328
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,660
或者是何时已经被释放了
Until the box is opened,

329
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,920
因此我们认为猫或活或死都是可以的
The cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.

330
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,590
对不起  我没听明白
I'm sorry. I don't get the point.

331
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,980
你当然不会明白  我还没说呢
Wellofof course you don't get it; I haven't made it yet.

332
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,170
你只有靠第六感才能明白了
You'd have to be psychic to get it,

333
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,350
而事实是根本就没有"第六感"这个东西
And there's no such thing as "psychic."

334
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,770
谢尔顿  你到底想说什么?
Sheldon, what's the point?!

335
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,900
就好像"薛定谔猫"
Just like schrodinger's cat,

336
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,590
现在你和莱纳德潜在的可能
Your potential relationship with leonard right now

337
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,940
既可以被认为是美好的也可以是不好的
Can be thought of as both good andadad.

338
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,690
只有当你打开盒子
It is only by opening the box

339
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,380
你才知道到底是哪一种
That you'll find out which it is.

340
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,510
明白了  你是说我应该先跟莱纳德处处看
Okay, so you're saying I should go out with leonard.

341
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,280
不不  不不
No, no, no, no, no.

342
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,040
我再说一遍吧
Let me start again.

343
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,610
在1935年  埃尔文·薛定谔...
In 1935, erwin schrodinger...

344
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,950
那儿有俩座
Two seats right there.

345
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,790
长寿石灰?
社会主义万岁

346
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,040
谢谢
Shay shay.

347
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,190
谢尔顿  我想我办错了件事
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

348
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,230
我知道
I can seththat.

349
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,890
除非你是在备战马拉松
Unless you're planning on running a marathon,

350
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,720
不然填塞陷儿和土豆泥都要
Choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes

351
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,450
简直就是淀粉摄入过量
Is a starch-filled redundancy.

352
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,210
不  是关于佩妮的
No, it's about penny.

353
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,200
关于佩妮的错误
A mistake involving penny.

354
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,470
好吧  我得缩小范围了
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

355
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,200
我觉得今天晚上我不能跟她去约会
I don't think I can go out with her tonight.

356
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160
那就别去
Then don't.

357
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,190
别人一般会说"为什么不去"
Other pelele would say "why not?"

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,930
别人可能比较感兴趣
Other people might be interested.

359
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,190
反正我还是要说
I'm going to talk anyway.

360
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,450
我猜你也是
I assumed you would.

361
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,070
现在我真的要和佩妮去约会了
Now that I'm actually about to go out with penny,

362
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,800
我反而并不激动  我反胃
I'm not excited--i'm nauseous.

363
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,730
那你的食物就是选对了
Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate.

364
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,690
淀粉能吸收对于呕吐起作用的
Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit

365
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,370
催吐物质
Available for violent expulsion.

366
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,610
-好吧  -你还犯了
Right. you also made

367
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,890
一个文法上的错误
A common grammatical mistake.

368
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,380
你说的是"反胃的"  其实你想说"让人作呕的"
You said "nauseous," when you meant "nauseated."

369
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,410
你接着说
But go on.

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,350
谢尔顿  这次约会很可能就是我唯一的机会
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with penny.

371
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,000
我如果搞砸了怎么办?
What happens if I blow it?

372
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,550
好  假设我们按你说的前提
Well, if we accept your premise

373
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,220
并且承认佩妮就是上帝安排给你的另一半
And also accept the highly improbable assumption

374
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,400
这个极不可能的假设
That penny is the only woman in the world for you,

375
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,550
那我们从逻辑上可以得出的结论是
Then we can logically conclude that the result

376
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,620
如果你搞砸这次约会  后果就是
Of blowing it would  be that you end up

377
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,110
你将会孤独  辛酸地终老  并且没有后代
A lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.

378
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,420
我脑中突然浮现了史酷比动画片里
The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers

379
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,470
一群邪恶的灯塔管理员的画面
From scooby-doo cartoons comes to mind.

380
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,940
你这是在捣乱
You're not helping.

381
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,220
好吧  我怎么回答你
All right, what respon on my part

382
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,650
才能赶紧结束这个话题呢?
Would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?

383
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,320
你就告诉我该不该去赴约
Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.

384
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,920
薛定谔猫
Scododinger's cat.

385
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,270
太聪明了
Wow,that's brilliant.

386
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,210
你听起来很吃惊啊
You sound surprised.

387
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,120
猴子睡在里头
好滋味在里头..

388
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,270
好啊
Hi.

389
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,310
好
Hi.

390
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,660
进来
Come on in.

391
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,800
谢谢
Thank you.

392
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,930
你真漂亮
You look very nice.

393
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,230
谢谢  你也是
Thank you. so do you.

394
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,810
我定了座位  8点
I made an 8:00 reservation.

395
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,030
好啊  太好了
Okay, yeah, great.

396
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
听着
Listen, um...

397
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,420
也许我们应该先谈谈
Maybe we should talk first.

398
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,450
好
Okay.

399
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,300
但是在你说之前
But before you say anything,

400
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,760
你听说过薛定谔猫吗
Have you ever heard of schrodinger's cat?

401
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,510
事实上  我听过太多薛定谔猫了
Actually, I've heard far too much about schrodinger's cat.

402
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,980
好
Good.

403
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,460
好啦  看来猫还是活的
All right, the cat's alive.

404
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,640
我们去吃饭吧
L's go to dinner.

405
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,670
鼻涕在哪儿  鼻涕
Bee ti tsai nar! bee ti!

406
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,220
擤干净鼻涕  快走快走
Xing gan jing bi ti hou quai zoui.

407
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,520
这不是柳丁脚踏车
