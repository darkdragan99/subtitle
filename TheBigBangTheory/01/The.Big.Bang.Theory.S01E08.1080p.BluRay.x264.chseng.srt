00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,560
该死的walletnook.com!
Damn you,walletnook.Com!

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,890
有什么问题吗?
Problem?

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,340
网站上的产品说明 完全是在误导
The online description was completely misleading.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,250
上面说 有八个插缝 加一个可抽取的ID卡夹
They said eight slots,plus removable id.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,220
对任何理性人来说 那意味着可以放九张卡
To any rational person,that would mean room for nine cards,

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,590
但上面没告诉你 可抽取的ID卡夹也占了一个插缝
but they don't tell you,the removable id takes up one slot.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,140
简直是恶梦!
It's a nightmare!

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,000
好吧 你真的需要那张
Okay,now,do you really need

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,730
美国荣誉审判联盟的会员卡吗?
the honorary justice league of america membership card?

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,750
从5岁起就一直 存放在我的钱包里
It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,700
为什么?
Why?

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,960
它上面写着"请随时随身携持本证"
It says "keep this on your person at all times."

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,840
就在蝙蝠侠签名的下面
it's right here under batman's signature.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,440
…这就是莱纳德和谢尔顿的房间
…And this is leonard and sheldon's apartment.

15

猜猜谁的父母刚装了宽带
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,480
莱纳德 容我介绍 新德里现场连线

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,330
你们好!
Hi!

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,340
把摄像头抬起来! 我正在看他的裤裆
Tilt up the camera up! I'm looking at his crotch.

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,360
抱歉 爸爸
Sorry,papa.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,610
噢 好多了
Oh,that's much better.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,620
噢 真不错
Oh,that's nice.

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,400
就像哈罗恩和塔维尔一样
Like haroon and tanvir.

28
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,000
不 不 跟哈罗恩和塔维尔不一样
No,no. Not like haroon and tanvir.

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,570
多么可爱的年轻人啊
Such sweet young men.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,060
他们刚刚收养了一个很可爱的小印度男孩
They just adopted the cutest little punjabi baby.

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,500
不是 我们跟哈罗恩和塔维尔不一样
No,we're not like haroon and tanvir.

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,610
你们和我儿子一样 是搞研究的?
So,are you boys academics like our son?

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,420
是的
Yes.

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,430
你们父母对你们那点可怜收入也无所谓吗?
And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,810
- 哦 是的 - 完全不
- Oh,yes. - Not at all.

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,760
爸爸 拜托 不要再提这些了
Papa,please. Don't start.

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,280
只是随便问问
It was just a question.

38
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,120
他太敏感了
He's so sensitive.

39
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,410
好啦 这就是我的生活 他们是我的朋友
Okay,that's my life. That's my friends.

等一下!
Wait! Wait!

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,870
你关之前 我们还有个好消息要告诉你

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,760
把电脑放下 把你朋友们聚过来
Put the computer down and gather your friends.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,100
- 什么 爸爸? - 我没看到你朋友
- What is it,papa? -I don't see your friends.

46
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,400
你们不觉得网上聊天
Is it just me,or does web chatting

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,700
穿着衣服很无聊吗?
with your clothes on seem a little pointless?

48
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,860
拉杰 你还记得拉丽塔·古塔吗?
Rajesh,do you remember lalita gupta?

49
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,740
那个用萨摩萨饼打我 还叫我贱民的小肥妞?
The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable?

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,480
是的
Yes.

51
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,040
她现在在南加州大学 学牙科专业
Well,now she's a dental student at usc,

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,950
我们把你的联系方式给了她
so we gave her your contact information.

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,190
你们干嘛那么做?
Why did you do that?

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,490
你已经26岁了 拉杰
You're 26 years old,rajesh.

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,940
我们想抱孙子
We want grandchildren.

56
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,310
可是爸爸 我不想...
But,papa,I'm not supposed...

57
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,890
拉丽塔的父母同意了你们的婚事
lalita's parents approved the match.

58
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,280
如果你决定春天举办婚礼 还可以避开雨季
If you decide on a spring wedding,we can avoid monsoon season.

59
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,460
春天就结婚?
A spring wedding?

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,400
你自己决定 孩子
It's up to you,dear.

61
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,640
我们可不想干涉
We don't want to meddle.

62
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,830
既然你们不想干涉 干嘛要干涉我的事?
If you don't want to meddle,then why are you meddling?

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,670
我说一句 你父母可能不认为这是干涉
If I may,your parents probably don't consider this meddling.

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,770
包办婚姻如今虽已不常见
While arranged marriages are no longer the norm,

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,300
但印度父母仍然在他们子女的婚姻中
indian parents continue to have

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,090
扮演着比以往更重要的角色
a greater-than-average involvement in their children's love lives.

67
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,720
为什么我们自己文化还要你来教导?
Why are you telling me about my own culture?

68
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,400
你看起来很困惑
You seemed confused.

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
抱歉 妈妈 爸爸 尽管我非常尊重你们
Sorry,mumi,papa,but with all due respect,

70
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,640
- 但我真的不想... - 对不起 孩子
- I really don't want to... - I'm sorry,darling.

71
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,740
我们不能再聊了
We have to go.

72
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,960
1989-1993年的美国电视剧
<天才小医生>开始了
Doogie howser is on.

73
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,990
奶奶 <小医生>时间到了!
Grandma! It's doogie time!

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
- 拜拜! - 拜拜!
- Bye-bye! - Bye-bye!

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,460
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

76
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,650
我也是
Neither do I.

77
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,520
<天才小医生>快20年没播了
Doogie howser's been off the air for like 20 years.

78
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,060
其实我读到过 它在印度是最受欢迎的电视节目
Actually,I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programs in india.

79
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,690
我认为希望有个当医生的孩子
It might speak to a cultural aspiration

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,390
可能是种文化向往吧
to have one's children enter the medical profession.

81
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,650
说的没错
I bet you're right.

82
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,020
我猜他们喜欢看<实习医生风云>
I bet they love scrubs.

83
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,250
有不喜欢的吗?
What's not to love?

84
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,950
喂! 在听吗?
Excuse me! Hello?

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
我父母想要我娶一个 根本不认识的人
My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger.

86
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,930
我该怎么办?
What am I going to do?

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,620
我建议你坦然接受吧
I suggest you go through with it.

88
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,690
什么?
What?

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,040
建立在浪漫爱情上的婚姻
Romantic love as the basis for marriage

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,190
只是从19世纪开始盛行
has only existed since the 19th century.

91
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,280
在那之前都是包办婚姻
Up until then,arranged marriages were the norm,

92
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,370
也很好地适应了社会发展
and it served society quite well.

93
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,140
1964年著名的百老汇长篇音乐剧
那正是<屋顶上的小提琴手>的蓝本
It's the entire premise of fiddler on the roof.

94
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,350
我不是音乐剧的粉丝 但我超爱那部音乐剧
I'm not a big fan of musicals,but I love that show.

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,260
我也是
Me too.

96
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,010
当然 对我来说很有文化感染力
Of course,it speaks to me culturally.

97
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,590
可以理解 但这类故事一般都超越了种族
Understandable,but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.

98
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,560
让人没法忘记里面那些 琅琅上口的曲调
Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.

99
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,850
- 噢 的确 - 就是啊!
- oh,absolutely. - Yeah!

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,930
好吧 我知道该怎么做了
Okay,I know what I'm going to do.

101
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,640
什么?
What?

102
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,630
去找新朋友
Find new friends.

103
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,710
那谁去租那部音乐剧?
so who wants to rent fiddler?

104
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,950
没必要 我们有特别收藏版
No need,we have the special edition.

105
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,650
也许我们真的就像哈罗恩和塔维尔
Well,maybe we are like haroon and tanvir.

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,310

108
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,880
我想取消天文馆的会员资格
Yeah,I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.

109
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,450
我也很抱歉 但我钱包里没地方放你们的会员卡了
Well,I'm sorry,too,but there's just no room for you in my wallet.

110
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,530
我能理解 但我要在 你们和自然历史博物馆中选择
I understand,but it was between you and the museum of natural history,

111
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,320
坦白说 你们那儿可没有恐龙
and frankly,you don't have dinosaurs.

112
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,880
我也会想你的 再见
I'll miss you,too. Bye-bye.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,420
好啦 我知道你们在发短信宣扬我的事 你们最好停下来
Okay,I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop.

114
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,950
天呐 我彻底完蛋了
oh,dear,I am rightly and truly screwed.

115
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,270
嗨 我以为你去找新朋友了

我是有伸出触角(尝试过)
I've got some feelers out.

117
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
在此同时 听听这个
In the meantime,listen to this.

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,080
嗨 拉杰 我是拉丽塔·古塔
Hi,rajesh. This is lalita gupta.

119
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,600
我妈把你的电话号码转交给我
Uh,your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me.

120
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,920

So,I'm calling you and… call me back. Bye.

121
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,750
你们能相信吗 她居然逼得那么紧
Can you believe how pushy she is?

122
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,310
那就别回她电话
So don't call her.

123
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,720
如果不打给她 我就再也别想和我父母说话了
If I don't call her,I won't hear the end of it from my parents.

124
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,340
那就打给她
So call her.

125
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,830
我怎么打给她? 你知道我不能和女人说话
How can I call her? You know I can't talk to women.

126
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,320
我没辙了 其他人呢?
I'm done. Anybody else?

127

Oh,not important.

135
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,340
总之 你想什么时候见面?
Uh,so,anyhow,when would you like to meet?

136
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,330
周五没问题
Friday works for me!

137
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,780
具体时间地点 我再打给你
I'll call you with a time and place.

138
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,910
还有 我是认真的 宝贝
But in the meantime,keep it real,babe.

139
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,170
现在你可以感激我了
You may now thank me.

140
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,880
谢什么? 把我的声音弄得像 辛普森一家似的?
For what? Making me sound like a simpsons character?

141
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,070
那好吧 下次你自己去约她
Fine. Next time make your own date.

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,450
这次我都不想!
I didn't want to make this one!

143
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,140
往好的方面想吧 也许她已经是个美丽动人的姑娘呢
Look on the bright side,she might turn out to be a nice,beautiful girl.

144
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,470
好极了 那我们就会结婚
Great,then we'll get married,

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
但我一句话都没办法跟她说
I won't be able to talk to her

146
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,890
我们一起的余生就会沉默中度过
and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.

147
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
我父母就是这样
It worked for my parents.

148
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,630
- 嗨 伙计们 - 嗨
- hi,guys. - Oh,hey.

149
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,870
我需要几只"豚鼠"做实验
I need some guinea pigs.

150
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,600
在洛杉矶瑞赛达有家供应实验动物的公司 你可以去试试
Okay,there's a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try.

151
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,730
但如果你的研究需要人类志愿者
But if your research is going to have human applications,

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,440
我能建议你换成小白鼠吗?
may I suggest white mice instead?

153
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,590
它们大脑的机能和人类的更接近
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.

154
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,390
我向上帝发誓 谢尔顿 总有一天
I swear to god,sheldon,one day,

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,760
我会跟上你的说话思维
I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.

156
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,340
这话他妈妈说了好多年了
His mom's been saying that for years.

157
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,160
什么事?
What's up?

158
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,260
好吧 我总算说服餐馆老板 把我换到吧台
Well,I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift,

159
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,430
所以我需要练习调酒
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

160
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,030
哦 太好了
Oh,great.

161
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,490
任何事情的成功关键 都是熟能生巧
Well,the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.

162
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,160
显然也有例外
With certain obvious exceptions.

163
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,900
比如说 自杀
Suicide,for example.

164
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,330
莱纳德 怎么样?
So,leonard,how about it?

165
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,390
你知道 佩妮 我们很乐意帮助你
You know,penny,we'd love to help you,

166
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,810
但拉杰现在正遇到了点麻烦
but 拉杰 is going through some stuff right now,

167
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,280
而且他不喝酒 所以...
and besides,he doesn't drink,so...

168
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,510
是吗?
really?

169
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,030
拉杰现在很痛苦 所以愿意尝试喝酒
Um,raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.

170
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,020
好了 给你 莱纳德
Okay,here you go,leonard.

171
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,860
龙舌兰日出酒
One tequila sunrise.

172
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,190
谢谢
Thank you.

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,960
知道吗 这杯酒能极好地诠释
You know,this drink is a wonderful example of

174
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,600
在各自不同重力下
how liquids with different specific gravities

175
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,500
液体是如何在圆柱容器内相互作用的
interact in a cylindrical container.

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,640
谢谢
Thank you.

177
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,470
好吧 拉杰 你要什么?
Okay,raj,what'll it be?

178
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,320
随便你推荐
Whatever you recommend.

179
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,450
草蜢酒怎么样?
Uh,how about a grasshopper?

180
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,480
草蜢酒我很在行
I make a mean grasshopper.

181
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,970
行吗? 好的
Okay? Good.Coming up.

182
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,800
谢尔顿 你要什么?
Sheldon,what are you going to have?

183
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,030
我要一杯无糖可乐
I'll have a diet coke.

184
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,530
好吧 你能点鸡尾酒吗?
Okay,can you please order a cocktail?

185
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,460
我需要练习调酒
I need to practice mixing drinks.

186
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,110
好吧
Fine.

187
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,950
我要圣洁古巴利布瑞酒
I'll have a virgin cuba libre.

188
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,340
那是朗姆可乐酒 去掉朗姆酒
That's,um,rum and coke without the rum.

189
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,580
对
Yes.

190
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,370
- 那么...可乐 - 是的
- So...coke. - Yes.

191
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,650
能调制成无糖的吗?
And would you make it diet?

192
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,650
冰箱里有罐装的
There's a can in the fridge.

193
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,940
古巴利布瑞酒通常是用高脚杯盛放 并且杯口放上酸橙
A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

194
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,080
那你游去古巴吧
Then swim to cuba.

195
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,960
吧台侍者应该热情待人才对
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.

196
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,420
好啦
Okay.

197
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,220
拉杰 给你
Raj,here you go.

198
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,740
好啦 下一个到谁?
All right. Who's next?

199
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,300
我想试试 光滑的咪咪
I'd like to try a slippery nipple.

200
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,100
好吧 跳过你了
Okay,you're cut off.

201
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,960
谁要续杯?
Anybody need a refill?

202
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,320
我的人生驶向何方 佩妮?
Where did my life go,penny?

203
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,720
眼下我还是无忧无虑的单身汉
One day I'm a carefree bachelor,

204
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,470
转眼我就结婚了 载着一车小孩
and the next I'm married and driving a minivan

205
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,480
去新德里郊区打板球
to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,850
你在跟我说话?
Are you talking to me?

207
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,300
这儿还有别人叫佩妮?
Is there another penny here?

208
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,560
我有计划
I had such plans.

209
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,840
我有梦想
I had dreams.

210
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,470
我要成为粒子天体物理学界的甘地
I was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astrophysics.

211
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,810
当然是有小鸡鸡的
But with a penis,of course.

212
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
太神了
Amazing.

213
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,070
我还小的时候
Ever since I was a little boy,

214
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,150
我爸就想让我像他一样当妇科医生
my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him.

215
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,730
我哪能做妇科医生?
How can I be a gynecologist?

216
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,640
我都不敢看女人的眼睛!
I can barely look a woman in the eye!

217
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,860
知道吗?
You know what?

218
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,390
我再也不要父母控制我的人生了
I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer.

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,190
是时候摊牌了
It's time for a showdown.

220
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,670
谁给我一个带摄像头的电脑!
Somebody give me a computer with a webcam!

221
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,670
亲爱的 我觉得这是酒劲儿的作用
Okay,sweetie,I think that's the grasshopper talking.

222
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,940
我要告诉我父母
And it's about to tell my parents that

223
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,310
我绝不会跟拉丽塔·古塔 骑象走向圣坛（结婚）
I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta.

224
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,420
好啦 冷静
Okay,calm down.

225
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,490
没人能逼你结婚
Look,no one can make you get married.

226
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,780
不如跟她见见面 看会怎么样?
Why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?

227
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,810
你没听我说吗?
Haven't you been listening to me?

228
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,380
我不能跟女人说话
I cannot talk to women.

229
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,390
呃 拉杰
Um,raj...

230
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,710
别说 看他多久才醒悟
no,no,let's see how long it takes him.

231
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,200
拉杰 亲爱的 你说你不能跟女人说话
Um,raj,honey,you say you can't talk to women,

232
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,230
可你一直在跟我说话
but you've been talking to me.

233
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,500
这将是个永远的谜
And now we'll never know.

234
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,500
说的对...
You're right. I...

235
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,190
我正在和你说话
I am talking to you.

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,740
你好 佩妮 怎么样?
Hello,penny,how are you?

237
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,890
我很好
I'm fine.

238
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,970
现在我只需确保 和草蜢酒见面之前 先喝一杯拉丽塔
Okay,now I just need to make sure I have a lalita before I meet the grasshopper.

239
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,140
真是甜蜜的绿色奇迹
It's a sweet,green miracle.

240
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
好吧 如果你要靠酒撑过这次约会
Okay,if you're going to drink on this date,

241
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
答应我不要太过头
just promise me you won't overdo it.

242
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,730
什么过头?
Overdo what?

243
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,250
快乐过头?
Happiness?

244
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,360
自由过头?
Freedom?

245
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,600
能保证我一切都将顺利无比的 这股体内热流?
This warm glow inside of me that promises everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?

246
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,830
没错
Yeah,that.

247
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,030
你带她来我的餐馆吧
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant

248
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,180
我在吧台可以照看你们
while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you.

249
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,840
好
Okay.

250
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,210
等等 你们什么计划?
Wait a minute. What's the plan here?

251
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,030
让他俩见面 他喜欢她 娶她
Let's say he meets her,he likes her,they get married.

252
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,220
然后在酒精的麻痹下度过余生?
What's he going to do,stay drunk for the rest of his life?

253
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,500
我父母就是这样
Worked for my parents.

254
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,890
不敢相信小拉丽塔·古塔就坐在我旁边
I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little lalita gupta.

255
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,490
事实如此了
Well,you are.

256
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,810
小拉丽塔
Little lalita.

257
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,940
说起来很好玩
That's fd of kinun to say.

258
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,650
小拉丽塔 小拉丽塔 小拉丽塔
Little lalita,little lalita,little lalita.

259
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,130
你可以试试
You should try it.

260
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,750
不用了
Oh,it's okay.

261
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,120
你瘦了好多啊
You have lost so much weight.

262
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,460
肯定吃了不少苦头吧 因为你以前好胖好胖
That must have been difficult for you because you were so,so fat.

263
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,460
你还记得吗?
Do you remember?

264
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,650
我记得
Yes,I do.

265
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,400
当然记得了
Of course you do.

266
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,040
肥成那样 谁能忘得了?
Who could forget being that fat?

267
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,530
我一直在努力忘记
Well,I've been trying.

268
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,750
你现在学牙科了
So you're a dental student.

269
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,950
你知道吗? 牙医的自杀率特别高
Mm,are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate?

270
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,890
当然没有空中交通管制员高
Not as high as,say,air traffic controllers,but,then,

271
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,010
但是牙医要比空中交通管制员多很多
there are far mo dreentists than air traffic controllers,

272
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,620
所以单就数量来说 还是你们胜出
so in pure numbers,you're still winning.

273
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,290
是啊!
Yay,me.

274
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,320
你有没有什么酒能让他轻点闹腾?
Do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious?

275
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,720
酒是没有这种功能的
Drinks do not work that way.

276
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,260
我觉得他没问题 看她
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

277
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,340
上次我妈给我找的女孩 是个留着胡子的秃子
The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

278
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,580
对不起 我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

279
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,530
怎么了?
What happened?

280
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,920
没什么 我就是有点不太想来
Nothing. I just really didn't want to come.

281
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,930
请来一杯"圣洁无糖古巴利布瑞酒"
Virgin diet cuba libre,please.

282
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,930
好吧
Okay.

283
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,000
用高脚杯 要插柠檬片
In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

284
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,810
我这就插
Oh,I'll wedge it right in there.

285
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,370
库萨帕里怎么样…
So how's koothrappali...

286
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,030
噢 我的天
oh,my lord.

287
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,900
什么?
What?

288
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,110
这是潘查理公主
That's princess panchali.

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,900
我很确定她叫拉丽塔
I'm pretty sure her name's lalita.

290
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,360
不是 是<猴子与公主>里的潘查理公主
No,no,princess panchali,from the monkey and the princess.

291
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,360
哦 对
Oh,yeah.

292
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,770
我想在网上看来着 不过要信用卡的
I tried to watch that online,but they wanted my credit card.

293
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
那是儿童故事
It's a children's story.

294
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,640
不 它不是
Oh,no,it isn't.

295
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,390
我小时候有一次生了病
When I was a little boy and got sick,

296
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,250
我经常生病 我妈妈会读这个故事给我听
which was most of the time,my mother would read it to me.

297
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,530
讲述一只与众不同而遭同类取笑的猴子
It's about an indian princess who befriends a monkey

298
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,790
后来和印度公主成为好朋友的故事
who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different.

299
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,610
因为某些原因 它引起我的强烈的共鸣
For some reason,I related to it quite strongly.

300
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,470
我知道原因
I know the reason.

301
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,080
我们都知道
We all know the reason.

302
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,840
谢尔顿 你想说什么?
Sheldon,what are you getting at?

303
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,140
那个女人像极了书上的潘查理li公主
That woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess panchali in the book.

304
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,050
多难得见到一个你喜欢的角色 活生生在眼前啊
How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?

305
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,420
每年动漫展上
Every year at comic-con.

306
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,310
迪斯尼每天都有
Every day at disneyland.

307
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
你都可以把白雪公主雇到家里
You can hire snow white to come to your house.

308
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,870
当然 最好是家里有小孩
Of course,they prefer it if you have a kid.

309
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,590
伙计们
Hey,guys.

310
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,780
她是拉丽塔·古塔
Isth is lalita gupta.

311
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,270
拉丽塔 这是莱纳德 谢尔顿 霍华德 还有佩妮
Lalita,this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny.

312
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,990
你们说多好? 她不是肥女了
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.

313
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,400
请原谅 公主陛下 我只是一只猴子
Forgive me,your highness,for I am but a monkey,

314
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,300
我的天性就是爬树
and it is in my nature to climb

315
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,740
我不是故意在你梳头时弄乱你的头发
I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.

316
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,500
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

317
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,200
你简直是美貌的潘查理公主的真身啊
You are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali.

318
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,800
不要开玩笑了
Oh,no kidding.

319
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,490
那人是谁i?
Who... who is that?

320
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,240
我最爱的印度童话主角
A beloved character from an indian folktale.

321
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,070
是我们这样的印度人 还是开赌场的印第安?
Us indian or "come to our casino" indian?

322
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,810
你们这样的
You indian.

323
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,120
简直太像了
The resemblance is remarkable.

324
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,110
我简直可以闻到你黑发上 点缀的荷花香
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.

325
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,730
谢谢
Well,thanks.

326
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,520
我想你的味道一定也很好
I imagine you smell very nice,too.

327
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,210
我每天洗两次澡 洗手无数次
I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.

328
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,530
真的? 我也是
Really? So do I.

329
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,060
但你是牙科学生 他只是疯子
But you're a dentist. He's nuts.

330
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,190
不要骂人 拉杰
Don't be insulting,rajesh.

331
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,110
谢尔顿 跟我说说那个跟我长得很像的公主吧
So,sheldon,tell me more about this princess you say I look like.

332
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,220
传说 她的眼睛是神用星星做的
It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars

333
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,600
她艳红的唇 令玫瑰都羞于开放
and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,280
我的天
Oh,my.

335
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,880
滚开 谢尔顿
Back off,sheldon.

336
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,480
为什么?
What?

337
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,730
如果你再调戏我的女人
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,

338
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,450
你会感受到我炽热的怒火
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

339
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,140
我没调戏她
I'm not hitting on her.

340
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,680
我也不是你的女人
And I am not your lady.

341
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,150
而且你也没有怒火
And you have no wrath.

342
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,730
你是我的女人
You are my lady.

343
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,900
我爸妈说了的
Our parents said so.

344
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,910
从各方面来说 我们都是百分之一百在一起了
We are,for all intents and purposes,100% hooked up.

345
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,520
好吧 有些话我跟你说清楚
Okay,let's get something straight here.

346
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,690
我今天来见你完全是敷衍我父母
The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case.

347
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,420
我才不会嫁你这种老土人呢
I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.

348
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,040
潘查理公主就是凭这种精神
That's exactly the kind of spirit with which princess panchali

349
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,650
带领猴子走向自由
led the monkeys to freedom.

350
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,030
去他妈潘查理公主
Screw princess panchali.

351
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,250
不许你这么说我
Hey,you can't talk to me like that.

352
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,980
可你不是什么潘查理公主啊
But you're not princess panchali.

353
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,550
算你走运 否则她都能把你的头砍下来
Luckily for you-- she could have you beheaded.

354
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,670
谢尔顿 你饿吗?
Sheldon,are you hungry?

355
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,890
我想吃点东西
I could eat.

356
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,460
我们走
Let's go.

357
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,270
刚才怎么回事?
What just happened?

358
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,100
我也无法解释
Beats the hell out of me.

359
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,040
我告诉你怎么回事
I'll tell you what happened.

360
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,700
我想我学会怎么泡印度妞了
I just learned how to pick up indian chicks.

361
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,020
让我怎么跟拉丽塔的父母交待?
What are we supposed to say to lalita's parents?

362
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,200
我和她爸爸一起打高尔夫
I play golf with her father.

363
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,810
我都没法面对他了
I won't be able to look at him.

364
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,480
也许你应该看着球 爸爸
Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball,papa.

365
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,250
你现在懂搞笑了
Oh,now you're a funny man.

366
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,730
这不好笑! 搞笑先生
This is not funny,mr.Funny man.

367
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,510
库萨帕里医生及夫人 说句公道话
Dr.And mrs.Koothrappali,in all fairness,

368
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,580
也不全是拉杰的错
it wasn't entirely raj's fault.

369
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,210
这我们的家事 谢尔顿
This is a family matter,sheldon.

370
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,500
我是莱纳德
I'm leonard.

371
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,390
不好意思 你们老外全都一个样
Oh,sorry. You all look alike to us.

372
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,780
他说的对 爸爸
But he's right,papa.

373
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,510
听他的
Listen to him.

374
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,370
你! 你把一切事情都搞砸了
You! You are the one who ruined everything.

375
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,080
是谁? 我们看不见
Who is it? We can't see.

376
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,380
转过去 转过去
Turn us. Turn us.

377
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,030
说吧 告诉我父母 为什么他们抱不上孙子
Go ahead,tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.

378
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,950
我怎么知道?
How would I know?

379
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,080
你精子量不足?
Do you have a low sperm count?

380
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,910
跟我的精子量完全没关系
This has nothing to do with my sperm count.

381
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,930
我们寄给你的四角裤你穿着吧 拉杰?
You are wearing the boxers that we sent you,aren't you,rajesh?

382
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,710
穿着呢 妈妈
Yes,mumi.

383
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,900
穿那种紧身三角裤对小鸡鸡不好
Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear tighty-whities.

384
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,050
能不能别提我的睾丸?
Can we please stop talking about my testicles?

385
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,020
谢尔顿 告诉他们你做了什么
Sheldon,tell them what you did.

386
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,490
我做了什么?
What did I do?

387
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,370
你抢走了他的约会对象
You left with his date.

388
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,710
朋友之间不能这样
Friends don't do that to each other.

389
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,610
好吧 知道了
All right,noted.

390
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,230
对不起
Sorry.

391
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,990
对不起? 你就说一个对不起完事?
Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,630
接受吧 拉杰 我连一句对不起都没收到过
Take it,raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.

393
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,160
我能否指出 她本来不会跟我走
And may I point out,she woavdn't hule asked me to go with her

394
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,920
如果你不是喝醉了又说一些令人讨厌的话
if you hadn't been drunk and boring.

395
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,640
喝醉?
Drunk?

396
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,150
还有令人讨厌 她的原话
And boring-- her words.

397
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,080
我就知道!
I knew it.

398
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,210
他去了美国 变成酒鬼了
He moves to america and he becomes an alcoholic.

399
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,820
我不是酒鬼
I'm not an alcoholic.

400
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,340
那你为什么喝醉?
Then why were you drunk?

401
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,930
就这一次 我发誓 爸爸
It was just this one time,papa,I swear.

402
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,920
你还否认？
Are you in denial?

403
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,060
要不要我们亲自去教育教育你?
Do we have to come over and do an intervention?

404
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,830
别让他在朋友面前丢脸
Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.

405
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,880
好吧
All right.

406
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,850
带我们出去

407

至少等我到了走廊再说

你和拉丽塔怎么样?

我们吃饭 她告诉我牙周病和心脏病有关
We ate,she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks--

416
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,820
都是我早就知道的东西 然后我回家
nothing I didn't already know-- and I came home.

417
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,270
那你以后不会再去见她了？
So you're not going to see her again?

418

为什么要和她再见面?
Why would I see her again?

419

我已经有牙医了
I already have a dentist.

420
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,020
谁来告诉他的父母 永远都抱不上孙子了?

421
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,070
* 敬生命 敬生命 我致敬 *
To life,to life,l'chaim

422
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,080

l'chaim,l'chaim,to life

* 生活给我们欢笑 有福有祸 干杯 *
life has a way of amusing us blessing and bruising us drink,

424

425
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,370
不敢相信 他中了什么邪?
I don't believe it. What's gotten into him?

426
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,010
也许一点圣洁古巴利布瑞酒 让他变得放浪了
maybe a couple virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.

427
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,440
你不是吧
You didn'T.

428
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,000
你们做你们的实验 我做我的
