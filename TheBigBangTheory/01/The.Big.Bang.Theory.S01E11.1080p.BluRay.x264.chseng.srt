1
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,780
将军
Checkmate.

2
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,140
-又将?  -显然
-again? -obviously,

3
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,130
你还不够格来玩三维国际象棋
You're not well suited for three-dimensional chess.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,680
你的速度或许更适合玩三维糖果盒游戏
Perhaps three-dimensional candy land would be more your speed.

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,290
这盘重来
Just reset the board.

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,510
这么多层都得我让你  还真丢脸啊
It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,470
好  伙计们
Hey, guys.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,160
-你拿了我的邮件了?  -是  在这
-did you get my mail? -yeah, right here.

9
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,810
-内布拉斯加那边怎样?  -比北达科他州强
-how was nebraska? -well, better than north dakota.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,220
我猜这笑话只有在内布拉斯加州才会好笑
I guess that joke's only funny in nebraska.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,840
就目前的数据来说  你还不能得出这结论
From the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion.

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,000
你所能唯一确定的是
All you can say with absolute certainty is that

13
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,000
这笑话在这儿不好笑
that joke is not funny here.

14
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,800
兄弟们  回来真好
Boy, it's good to be back.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,820
-你家人怎么样?  -这趟旅行简直不能再糟了
-how's your family? -it was the worst trip.

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,630
一个周末下来家里人全病了
Everyone got sick over the weekend.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,620
-病了?  -又来了
-sick? -here we go.

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,710
什么病?
What kind of sick?

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,060
我猜  就是流感吧
The flu, I guess.

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,420
我不是要你猜  我要你确定
I don't need you to guess. I need you to know.

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,070
第一次出现症状是在什么时候
Now, when did the symptoms first appear?

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,360
大概是周五
Maybe friday.

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,950
周五  上午还是下午?
Friday. was that morning or afternoon?

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,730
我...我不...
I-i don't...

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,620
小姐  好好想想  是谁  在什么时候擦过鼻子?
Think, woman. who blew their nose and when?

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,100
没事的  谢尔顿
Sheldon, relax.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,870
她没有任何症状  我确定她不会传染
She doesn't have any symptoms. I'm sure she's not contagious.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,600
拜托
Oh, please.

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,410
如果流感只有在症状出现后才会感染
If influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear,

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,510
那它早该在几千年前就消失了
It would have died out thousands of years ago.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
在开始使用石器工具和创作洞穴壁画的年代
Somewhere between tool using and cave painting,

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,920
"能人"们肯定会想方设法
Homo habilis would have figured out

33
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,640
干掉流着鼻涕的家伙的
how to kill the guy with the runny nose.

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,370
佩妮  你要原谅谢尔顿  他有点病理恐惧
Penny, you'll have to excuse sheldon. he's a bit of a germaphobe.

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,930
没关系  我能理解
It's okay. I understand.

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,140
谢谢你的照顾  现在请你离开
Thanks for your consideration. now please leave.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,610
你最好趁他还没拿来沙尔(消毒药水)来对着你喷的时候赶紧闪
You'd better go before he starts spraying you with lysol.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,630
好的  谢谢你替我拿邮件
Okay. well, thank you for getting my mail.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
小意思  欢迎回家
No problem. welcome home.

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,920
怎么了?!
What?!

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第11集
The.Pancake.Batter.Anomaly

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,890
你在搞什么鬼东西
What the hell are you doing?

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,270
我在制作皮氏培养皿培养喉咙里的细菌
I'm making petri dishes to grow throat cultures.

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,620
用酸橙果冻?
With lime jell-o?

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,070
我需要一个(生长物)培养基
I need a growth medium,

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,110
而某人却把杏仁酸奶给扫荡一空了
And someone polished off the apricot yogurt.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,350
来  从我喉咙里取些唾液
Here, swab my throat.

48
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,800
我可不干
I don't think so.

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,980
如果我要走在它前面搞定它
If I'm going to get ahead of this thing,

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,160
就必须弄清楚我喉咙里是什么东西在生长
I need to find out what's growing in my throat.

51
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,670
谢尔顿  你没病
Sheldon, you are not sick.

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,730
这些行为有  但你没有
This is, but you are not.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,280
我们根本不清楚她带进屋子来的
We have no idea what pathogen typhoid

54
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,760
是什么伤寒病原体
penny has introduced into our environment.

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,620
鉴于我从没去过内布拉斯加
For having never been to nebraska,

56
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,240
我十分肯定我没有携带玉米外壳抗体
I'm fairly certain that I have no corn-husking antibodies.

57
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,480
谢尔顿  你不觉得你反应过度了吗
Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?

58
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,340
当我倒在医院昏迷不醒
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,290
要靠那些低智商来医治我的时候
relying on inferior minds to cure me,

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,590
这些果冻培养细菌连同我的笔记
These jell-o cultures and my accompanying notes

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,160
会让他们有机会最后一搏
Will give them a fighting chance.

62
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,750
-我回去睡觉了  -等等
-i'm going back to bed. -wait.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
-把这个放到卫生间  -干吗
-put this in the bathroom. -what for?

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,220
我要测量我体液的摄取和排放情况
I need to measure my fluid intake and output

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,130
确保我肾功能没有衰竭
To make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.

66
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,000
这是我用来和糕饼的!
I mixed pancake batter in this!

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,490
不  这个实验皿一直是用来盛小便的
No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.

68
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,530
你有闲工夫把房间里的所有东西都贴上标签
You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,180
即使标签笔都有标签
Including the label maker,

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,150
就不能抽出十秒钟把它标记上"小便皿"吗?
But you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said "urine cup"?

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,850
这不在杯底嘛
It's right here on the bottom.

72
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,530
我猜我该给贝蒂妙厨写封道歉信了
I guess I owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology.

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,480
我的天呐
Oh, dear god.

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,560
莱纳德  我病了!
Leonard, I'm sick!

75
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,010
莱纳德  我病了!
Leonard, I'm sick!

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,220
莱纳德  我的加衬芯床罩掉了  我一弯腰鼻窦就疼
Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

77
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,340
莱纳德  你在哪呢
-hey! -leonard, where are you?

78
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,990
我在工作
I'm at work.

79
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,070
早上六点半?
At 6:30 in the morning?

80
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,700
还是星期天?
On sunday?

81
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,230
-怎么会  -他们叫我帮忙
-why? -they asked me to come in.

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,420
我没听到电话响过啊
I didn't hear the phone ring.

83
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,510
他们发的短信
They texted me.

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,210
是这样  跟我预测的如出一辙  我病了
Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

85
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,810
我的体温从凌晨两点开始就呈指数曲线上升
My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2:00 a.m.,

86
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,220
而且我痰中含血量惊人地高
And I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.

87
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,760
开玩笑吧?
No kidding?

88
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,340
没有  不仅如此
No, not only that,

89
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,730
痰的颜色也已经从透明变成牛奶绿了
It has shifted from clear to milky green.

90
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,380
好吧
All right,

91
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,870
多休息  多喝点液体
Get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.

92
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,360
我还能喝什么  气体  固体  还是电离等离子体?
What else would I drink, gases, solids, ionized plasma?

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,640
想喝什么随你便
Drink whatever you want.

94
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,100
-我想喝汤  -那就煲汤啊
-i want soup. -then make soup.

95
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,560
家里没有汤
We don't have soup.

96
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,650
谢尔顿  我在工作呢
I'm at work, sheldon.

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,710
那是狗叫吗
Is that a dog?

98
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,010
在实验室里?
In the lab?

99
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,230
他们在训练狗操作离心机
They're training dogs to operate the centrifuge

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,600
以备他们需要狗去...
For when they need dogs to...

101
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,880
为盲人科学家
Operate the centrifuge

102
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,520
操作离心机  我要挂了
For blind scientists. I have to go.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,610
霍华德  电话响了!
Howard, it's the phone!

104
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,200
我知道电话响了  妈  我耳朵不聋!
I know it's the phone, ma, I hear the phone!

105
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,870
是谁在这么邪恶的时间来电话?!
Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?!

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,820
不知道!
I don't know!

107
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,970
那就问问他们为什么在这么邪恶的时间来电话?!
Well, ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour!

108
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,670
我在跟你说话怎么问他们问题?!
How can I ask them when I'm talking to you?!

109
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,380
你好
Hello.

110
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,370
霍华德  我是莱纳德  牛奶绿色警报
It's leonard. code milky green.

111
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,600
天呐  不是真的吧
Dear lord, not milky green.

112
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,830
警报属实  伴有发烧症状
Affirmative. with fever.

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,090
谁来的电话?
Who's on the phone?!

114
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,350
是莱纳德!
It's leonard!

115
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,300
他为什么来电话?!
Why is he calling?!

116
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,900
谢尔顿病了!
Sheldon's sick!

117
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,210
你还跟他一起玩呢?!
Were you playing with him?!

118
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,070
看在上帝的份上  妈  我都二十六岁了!
For god's sake, ma, I'm 26 years old!

119
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,050
不好意思  长大了先生!
Excuse me, mr. grownup!

120
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,850
你早饭想吃什么?!
What do you want for breakfast?!

121
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,370
巧克力牛奶和冰冻松饼  谢谢!
Chocolate milk and eggos, please!

122
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,960
-听我说  -等下  有呼叫等待
-listen to me. -hang on. call waiting.

123
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,570
不  别...!
No, don't...!

124
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,090
你好
Hello.

125
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,210
霍华德  我病了
Howard, I'm sick.

126
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,390
霍华德在睡觉呢  我是他妈!
Howard's sleeping. this is his mother!

127
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,310
你为什么要在这么邪恶的时间来电话?
Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?

128
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,240
我要喝汤
I need soup.

129
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,180
找你自己的妈妈去!
Then call your own mother!

130
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,010
是谢尔顿
It was sheldon.

131
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,300
-我刚才阻止你来着  -是我的错
-i tried to stop you. -it's my own fault.

132
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,010
我忘了06年耳炎大事件之后
I forgot the protocol we put in place

133
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,730
我们定下的协议了
after the great ear infection of 06.

134
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,440
你打电话给库萨帕里
You call koothrappali.

135
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,060
在接下来的18到24小时里  我们要找地方躲起来
We need to find a place to lay low for the next 18 to 24 hours.

136
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,230
等一下
Stand by.

137
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,530
妈  我朋友能来家里坐坐吗?
Ma, can my friends come over?

138
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,890
我刚洗过地毯!
I just had the carpet steamed!

139
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,850
被否决了
That's a negatory.

140
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,260
但是今天电影展里会上演"决战猩球"全集
But there's a planet of the apes marathon at the nuart today.

141
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,700
5部电影  每部2小时
Five movies, two hours apiece..

142
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,020
算是个开始
It's a start.

143
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,440
有个疯子加流浪汉  在18号桌
Homeless, crazy guy at table 18.

144
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,150
不  只是疯子而已
No, just crazy.

145
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,370
谢尔顿  你在这里做什么?
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

146
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,780
我病了  非常感谢
I'm sick. thank you very much.

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,110
怎么会是我传染给你的呢?  我没有病
How could you have gotten if from me? I'm not sick.

148
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,550
你是携带者
You're a carrier.

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,700
这里的所有人都在劫难逃
All these people here are doomed.

150
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,720
你们在劫难逃啦!
You're doomed!

151
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,100
谢尔顿  你想要干什么?
Sheldon, what do you want?

152
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,840
我想要喝汤
I want soup.

153
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,980
为什么你不...?
Why didn't you...?

154
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,140
为什么你不在家弄汤喝?
Why didn't you just have soup at home?

155
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,980
佩妮  我的智商是187
Penny, I have an iq of 187.

156
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,260
你不会想想  如果我在家有办法
Don't you imagine that if there were a way for me

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,230
喝汤的话  你觉得我会来这里么?
To have had soup at home, I would have thought of it?

158
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,650
你可以叫外卖啊
You can have soup delivered.

159
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,410
这点我倒没想过
I did not think of that.

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,650
很明显  我已经处于发烧后的精神错乱状态了
Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

161
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,150
趁我还知道汤匙是做什么用
Please bring me some soup

162
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,240
请快给我上汤吧
While I still understand what a spoon is for.

163
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,110
你想要什么汤?
What kind of soup do you want?

164
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,090
我母亲过去给我做的汤  里面有切开的豌豆
Well, my mother used to make me this split pea

165
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,330
切片的法兰克福香肠和一些自制的油煎面包块
With little frankfurter slices and these homemade croutons.

166
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,140
我们有鸡汤  玉米汤  和土豆葱汤
We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

167
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,330
有没有什么汤里是放切片的法兰克福香肠
Could I get any of those with little frankfurter slices

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,190
和自制的油煎面包块的?  没有
And homemade croutons?  No.

169
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,810
那就给我个惊喜吧
Then surprise me.

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,850
你们觉得它是黄绿色还是树绿色?
Would you call that "moss green" or "forest green"?

171
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,620
看看  每个人都选了黑猩猩
Look at this. everyone went chimp.

172
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,790
我要指出我之前提议选的是人猿
I'd like to point out that I voted for orangutan,

173
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,880
但是被你给否决了!
But you shouted me down!

174
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,650
-佩妮  -你在哪呢?
-hi, penny. -hey, where are you?

175
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,270
我在...工作
I'm... at work.

176
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,390
你的声音很奇怪
You sound funny.

177
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,000
我...我穿着反辐射工作服
Look. I'm... I'm in a radiation suit.

178
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,500
-有什么事吗?  -我也在工作
-what's up? -i'm at work, too,

179
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,710
你绝对猜不到谁在这里用病菌感染着我整个工作区
And you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
谢尔顿在芝士蛋糕店
Sheldon's at the cheesecake factory.

181
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,090
-告诉他让他回家  -他不走
-just tell him to go home. -he won't leave.

182
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,020
他怕他会晕倒在公车上
He's afraid he'll pass out on the bus,

183
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,410
然后有人会把他的器官割走
And someone will harvest his organs.

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,170
他已经有妄想症状了  不过他已经找到了地方呆着
He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.

185
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,800
你能过来接他吗?
Can you please come get him?

186
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,890
当然可以
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

187
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,970
我的天啊  辐射室出现裂缝了!
Oh, my god, there's a breach in the radiation unit!

188
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,350
整个城市要陷于危险中了!  我的天啊!
The whole city is in jeopardy! oh, my god!

189
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,400
安全壳已经开始融化了  不能说了  拜!
The containment vessel's melting. gotta go. bye!

190
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,230
我感到非常内疚
I feel really guilty.

191
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,800
你做了你该做的
You did what you had to do.

192
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,630
把你的脏爪子从我的爆米花上移开
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn,

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,110
你个恶心可恶的大猩猩!
You damn dirty ape!

194
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,030
谢谢你带我回家
Thanks for bringing me home.

195
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,370
没关系  我今天不是很需要上班
It's okay. I didn't really need to work today.

196
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,520
反正我也没车和房子的贷款要缴
It's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.

197
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,130
好  那就好
Good, good.

198
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,770
好吧  祝你康复
Okay, well, you feel better.

199
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,670
等等!  你要去哪里?
Wait! where are you going?

200
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,790
回家...  去写一些空头支票
Home... to write some bad checks.

201
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,830
你就这样扔下我不管?
You're going to leave me?

202
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,210
谢尔顿  你已经长大了  你之前没生过病吗
Sheldon, you are a grown man. haven't you ever been sick before?

203
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,040
当然生过  不过有人照顾我啊
Of course, but not by myself.

204
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,410
真的?  从来没自己一人过?
Really? never?

205
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,660
有一次  我15岁
Well, once, when I was 15,

206
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,190
暑假的时候在德国的海德尔堡学院
Spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany.

207
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,670
出国留学?
Studying abroad?

208
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,020
不是  被邀请当客座教授
No. visiting professor.

209
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,710
总之  当地的烹饪方法用的香肠比我习惯的多了一些
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,330
结果就是肚子里上演了陆军联合闪电战
Than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg,

211
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,060
我的大肠扮演的是捷克斯洛伐克
With my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia.

212
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,520
当时没有人在那里照顾你么?
And there was no one there to take care of you?

213
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,700
我妈要飞回德克萨斯帮我爸爸的忙
My mom had to fly back to texas to help my dad,

214
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,660
因为房子的煤渣砖又塌方了
Because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again.

215
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,700
-又?  -当时是狂风季节
-again? -it was tornado season.

216
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,010
那是个临时工棚
And it was an aluminum house.

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,210
当时学院公寓里的管家不会讲英文
The housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any english.

218
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,630
当我终于让她相信我生病了的时候
When I finally managed to convince her I was sick,

219
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,830
她说  "mochtest du eine darmspfilung?"
She said,"mochtest du eine darmspfilung?"

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,970
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

221
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,210
根据之后发生的事  我认为意思是
Based on what happened next, I assume it means,

222
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,240
"你想要灌肠吗?"
"would you like an enema?"

223
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,700
好吧  亲爱的  我来照顾你吧
Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.

224
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,660
你需要我做什么
What do you need?

225
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,570
我妈妈常给我用海绵擦身
My mom used to give me sponge baths.

226
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,370
基本规则  禁止用海绵擦身
Ok ground rules. No sponge baths,

227
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,900
还有绝对禁止灌肠
And definitely no enemas.

228
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,760
同意
Agreed.

229
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,730
开始了
Here we go.

230
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,910
2个半小时的猩猩大战  老天啊
Ten-and-a-half hours of ape-y goodness.

231
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,590
晕  我的眼镜
Damn it, my glasses.

232
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,090
兄弟们  我处于"半瞎"状态  你们可以帮我找找么?
Okay, I'm blind here, guys. can you help me find them?

233
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,950
-对不起  -好
-sorry. -okay.

234
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,660
找到了
Found them.

235
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,410
好极了
Oh, great.

236
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,170
对不起  你没有备用的吗
I'm sorry. don't you have a spare?

237
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,300
有啊  可是在家里
Yeah, at home.

238
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,540
如果你现在走
If you leave now,

239
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,370
你可以赶在大猩猩把查尔顿·赫斯顿的屎掏出来之前回来
You can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston.

240
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,980
不过谢尔顿要是在家的话  你就将永远被困在
Unless sheldon's there, in which case, you'll be trapped forever

241
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,920
他那喋喋不休的  超神经质的鼻涕网中
In his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

242
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,530
佩妮吗
Hi. penny?

243
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,130
我想问下  谢尔顿还在店里吗
I was just wondering, is sheldon still at the restaurant?

244
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,700
好的  你真是个大好人  我得挂了
Okay, that was very nice of you. okay, I gotta go.

245
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,150
切尔诺贝利事件升级了  挂了  再见
Got kind of a full-blown chernobyl thing here. gotta go, bye.

246
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,820
他在家  我完了
He's home. I'm screwed.

247
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,500
要看十个半小时的模糊猩猩
Ten-and-a-half hours of ape-y blurriness.

248
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,340
做个激光手术怎么样?
How about lasik?

249
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,740
你想让我去做眼部手术?
You want me to get eye surgery?

250
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,050
你是宁可回家跟谢尔顿斗智斗勇
Would you rather go home and deal with sheldon,

251
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,340
还是在你的角膜上用激光切个奇怪的槽
Or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

252
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,620
-怎么着?  -我正在想
-well? -i'm thinking.

253
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,390
好了  很好很舒适
Okay, nice and cozy.

254
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,240
好吧  一会见
Okay? I'll see you later.

255
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,560
等等
Wait.

256
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,200
你能不能把这个擦在我胸上?
Will you please rub this on my chest?

257
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,590
谢尔顿  你自己不能干吗
Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?

258
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,670
维克斯达姆膏会弄得我手上闻起来很奇怪
Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.

259
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,930
-可是  谢尔顿...  -求你了  求你了  求你了
-but, sheldon... -please, please, please?

260
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,330
真是被你打败了
I can't believe I'm doing this.

261
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,550
不  不  逆时针涂  要不我胸毛就该打结了
No, no. counterclockwise, or my chest hair mats.

262
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,490
对不起
Sorry.

263
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,740
你能唱"乖乖猫"给我听吗
Can you sing "soft kitty"?

264
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,870
什么
What?

265
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,640
我妈妈在我病的时候总唱给我听
My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.

266
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,900
-对不起亲爱的  我不会唱  -我可以教你
-oh, sorry, honey. I don't know it. -i'll teach you.

267
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,800
乖乖猫  暖暖猫
Soft kitty, warm kitty,

268
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,290
小小毛绒球
Little ball of fur

269
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,040
快乐猫  瞌睡猫
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty,

270
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,230
呜  呜  呜(猫的叫声)
Purr, purr, purr

271
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,090
该你了
Now you.

272
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,990
乖乖猫
Soft kitty,

273
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
暖暖猫
Warm kitty...

274
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,960
小小毛绒球
Little ball of fur

275
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,000
手别停
Keep rubbing.

276
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,640
小小毛绒球
Little ball of fur

277
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,950
你看到什么了?  我看不到
What do you see? I can't.

278
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,770
客厅好像没人
The living room appears to be empty.

279
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,540
他肯定在他卧室
He must be in his bedroom.

280
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,670
我的备用眼镜在我卧室的柜子上
My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser,

281
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,670
就挨着我的蝙蝠侠发光器
Next to my bat signal.

282
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,640
我又不进去
I'm not going in there.

283
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,810
-拉杰?  -没门  伙计
-raj? -no way, jose.

284
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,970
可是我没法去拿啊  我什么都看不到
But I can't do it. I can't see anything.

285
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,460
那没关系  有无线迷你摄像头和蓝牙耳机
It's all right. wireless minicam and bluetooth headset.

286
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,780
我们就是你的眼睛
We'll be your eyes.

287
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,700
好吧
Fine.

288
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,280
还有个玩意儿
One more thing.

289
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,060
这是个次音速冲击传感器
This is a subsonic impact sensor.

290
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,090
如果谢尔顿下床并开始走路
If sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk,

291
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,730
这个器件会记录下来并把信号发回笔记本
This device will register it and send a signal to the laptop.

292
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,210
由此  根据这间公寓的地理结构
At that point, based on the geography of the apartment

293
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,110
和病猫谢尔顿的步行速度
And the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon,

294
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,490
你有7秒钟的时间出来  带眼镜或者不戴眼镜
You'll have 7 seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.

295
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,520
我的脚步声不会干扰它判断吗?
Won't my footsteps set it off?

296
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,990
不会  你只能用你的手和膝盖走路
No. you'll be on your hands and knees.

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,980
你要把这个传感器放到离谢尔顿尽可能近的地方
You'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon's room.

298
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,060
我用手和膝盖走路我怎么带着这个玩意?
How do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?

299
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,400
低一点
Stay low.

300
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,400
左转
Bear left.

301
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,680
-现在直给  -什么
-now keep true. -what?

302
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,220
-意思是"一直走"  -说"一直走"不就得了
-it means "go straight." -then just say, "go straight."

303
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,840
你报方位的时候
You don't say, "go straight."

304
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,660
不说"一直走"  是说"直给"
When you're giving bearings, you say, "keep true."

305
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,590
好吧
All right.

306
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,210
我把头给撞了
I just hit my head.

307
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,750
因为你没"直给"
Because you didn't keep true.

308
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,990
好啦  右转
Okay, turn right.

309
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,120
图像受损了
The picture's breaking up.

310
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,220
把你的脑袋往右斜
Angle your head to the right.

311
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,920
再来点儿
Now, a little more.

312
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,630
再来点儿
Little more.

313
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,650
好了  现在直给吧
That's it. now, just keep true.

314
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,450
你离谢尔顿的屋子已经很近了  可以部署传感器了
You're close enough to sheldon's room. deploy the sensor.

315
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,440
现在把它打开
Now, turn it on.

316
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,390
它没开着吗?
It wasn't on?

317
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,530
那我干嘛还要爬着进来
Then why did I have to crawl?

318
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,610
是  我想你可以不用
No, I guess you didn't.

319
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,160
好了  打开了
Okay, it's on.

320
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,680
好  从现在开始  你就得爬着走了
Good. from this point forward, you will have to crawl.

321
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,640
明白
I know.

322
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,390
等等  传感器探测到了什么  把头转回去
Hang on, the sensor's picking up something. turn your head back.

323
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,420
你真不是个东西
You rat bastard.

324
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,770
看  传感器能用的吧
Told you the sensor would work.

325
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,420
你成心让我在这陪着谢尔顿活受罪
You deliberately stuck me with sheldon.

326
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,570
没办法  我也是不得以啊  你也看到谢尔顿什么样了
Come on, I had to. you see what he's like?

327
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,870
佩妮  我饿了
Penny, I'm hungry.

328
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,250
好的  亲爱的  有好消息  莱纳德回来了
It's okay, sweetie. good news! leonard's home!

329
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,830
交给你了  祝你好运  再见
Here you go. good luck. bye.

330
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,920
莱纳德  我饿了
Leonard! I'm hungry!

331
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,210
佩妮  把我带上吧
Penny, take me with you!

332
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,020
我想吃烤芝士三明治
I want grilled cheese.

333
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,040
你觉得佩妮会过来照顾咱们吗
Do you think penny will come here and take care of us?

334
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,130
我觉得佩妮再也不会到这来了
I don't think penny's ever coming here again.

335
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,410
我鼻塞得厉害
I'm very congested.

336
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,900
怎么?
Yeah? so?

337
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,530
你能不能帮我去厨房
Could you go to the kitchen

338
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,860
拿一个标有"分泌粘液"的胶头滴管
And get me the turkey baster labeled "mucous"?

339
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,930
我一站起来  我就会吐的
If I stand, I'll vomit.

340
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,420
在水槽下面  黄色的特百惠碗
Under the sink, yellow tupper ware bowl.
