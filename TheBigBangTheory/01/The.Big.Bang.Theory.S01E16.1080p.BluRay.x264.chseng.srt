1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,720
-把他按倒  -你没辙了  谢尔顿
Take him down! He's got you, sheldon.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,150
放得漂亮!  你实在太菜了
Look at this move! He's completely schooling you.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,440
伙计们  伙计们
Hey, guys. guys.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,870
有几个女服务生要我来问你们一声
Some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,030
这个叫"Tresling"  它是将掰手腕需要的力量
It's called Tresling. It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,630
与玩俄罗斯方块需要的头脑敏捷度相结合的终极运动
with the mental agility of Tetris into the ultimate spots.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,760
是  很棒
Yeah, that's terrific.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,370
但她们是要我来问  你们是否可以打住了
but they wanted me to ask you to cut it the hell out.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,010
好  来吧  大伙  来了
Great. Come here, guys. Come on.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,290
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,210
我们还是结束吧  打成平手  俄罗斯方块你赢了
We might as well stop. It's a stalemate. You're beating me in Tetris,

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,840
你的上肢力量就跟个同性恋差不多
but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,890
同性恋?  我现在就干你
Keebler elf? I've got your Keebler elf right here.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,220
好  打成平手
Okay, it's a stalemate.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,150
莱纳德  礼拜六我们会
So, leonard, will we be seeing you

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,250
在这里看到你和你的免费生日奶酪蛋糕吗
on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,180
他不能吃奶酪蛋糕
He can't eat cheesecake.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,620
他乳糖过敏的
He's lactose intolerant.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,000
好  那可以要胡萝卜蛋糕
Okay, he can have carrot cake.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,340
那蛋糕上面装饰的奶油奶酪呢
What about the cream cheese frosting?

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,690
他可以掰下来不吃
He can scrape it off.

22
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,370
不提蛋糕了
Forget about the cake.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,310
你怎么会知道礼拜六我生日?
How do you know that my birthday's saturday?

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,740
我占卜过你的星座  还记得?
I did your horoscope, remember?

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,890
我还想占卜你们每一个的
I was going to do everybody's,

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,630
直到被谢尔顿那典型且神经兮兮的理论所打断
Until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,270
正式申明下
For the record,

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,740
那"神经兮兮的理论"是贝尔特拉姆·福尔
"that psychotic rant" was a concise summation

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,670
所做研究的简要概括
Of the research of bertram forer, who in 1948,

30
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,630
他于1948年通过精心设计的实验
Proved conclusively through meticulously designed

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,330
结论性地证明占星术只不过
Experiments that astrology is nothing

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,330
是伪科学的噱头
but pseudo-scientific hokum.

33
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,160
叽里呱啦叽里呱啦  典型的金牛座
Blah, blah, blah. typical taurus.

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,220
说真的  我们是不是周六见?
So, seriously. are we going to see you saturday?

35
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,220
-我想不是吧  -为什么?
Uh, I don't inink so. why not?

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,510
我不庆祝生日的
I don't celebrate my birthday.

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,050
开玩笑  你不会的
Shut up. yeah, you do.

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,440
这没什么大不了  我一直都是这样的
It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised.

39
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,840
我父母只会在我取得成就的时候庆祝
My parents focused on celebrating achievements,

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,110
而被逐出产道
And being expelled from a birth canal

41
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,110
显然不算其中一项
was not considered one of them.

42
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,710
这太可笑了
That's so silly.

43
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,790
事实上  这还是一篇有理有据的文章
It's actually based on very sound theories.

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,620
他母亲发表在报纸上的
His mother published a paper on it.

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,740
这篇文章什么标题
Well, what was it called?

46
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,340
"我讨厌我儿子  因此他不能吃蛋糕"?
"i hate my son and that's why he can't have cake"?

47
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,730
显然易见  这是正确的
It was obviously effective.

48
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,170
莱纳德长大后现在是一位实验物理学家
Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist.

49
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,820
也许如果她还不让他过圣诞节
Perhaps if she'd also denied him christmas,

50
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,360
他还会更出色些
he'd be a little better at it.

51
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,890
谢谢
Thank you.

52
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,040
我很爱过生日
Well, I love birthdays.

53
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,940
起床后早饭是妈妈特制的法式吐司
Waking up to mom's special french toast breakfast,

54
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,570
戴上生日王冠
Wearing the birthday king crown,

55
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,570
和朋友们玩激光枪捉人
playing laser tag with all my friends...

56
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,440
是吗  看见不?
Yeah, see?

57
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,860
那才是孩子们该干的
That's what kids should have.

58
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,750
事实上  这是在去年
Actually, that was last year.

59
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,790
这么说你真的从来没开过生日派对?
So you really never had a birthday party?

60
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,470
没错  但没问题啊
No, but it was okay.

61
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,520
我小时候
I mean, when I was little,

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,030
还想父母可能会改变主意
I'd think maybe my parents would change

63
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,540
然后办个派对给我个惊喜
Their mind and surprise me with a party.

64
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,070
有一次生日  我上完大提琴课回来
Like this one birthday I came home from my cello

65
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,880
看见外面停着许多陌生的轿车
Lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front.

66
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
我走到门外时
When I got to the door,

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
听得见里面人在细声细语
I could hear people whispering

68
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,840
还闻到了表兄的巧克力蛋糕
and I could smell german chocolate cake,

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,330
那是我的最爱
Which is my favorite.

70
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,250
然后呢?
And?

71
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,570
结果是我祖父去世了
It turns out my grandfather had died.

72
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,310
天呐  那太糟糕了
Oh, my god. that's terrible.

73
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,560
那次倒有点生日派对的意思
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,510
所有的亲戚都来了  也有蛋糕  所以...
I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so...

75
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,500
这是我听过的最可怜的事了
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

76
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
是吗?
You think?

77
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,170
继续  告诉她你高中毕业舞会的事
Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.

78
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,950
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第16集
The.Peanut.Reaction

79
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,910
叫他们千万别忘了...不放花生
Make sure they remember-- no peanuts.

80
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,900
霍华德  城里每家泰国餐馆
Howard, every thai restaurant in town

81
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,270
都知道你不能吃花生
knows you can't eat peanuts.

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,310
他们看到我进去都直接说  "不放花生男来了!"
When they see me coming, they go, "ah, no-peanut boy!"

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,980
好  佩妮
Hello, penny.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,090
莱纳德刚走
Leonard just left.

85
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,660
我知道  我来跟你说呢
I know. I want to talk to you.

86
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,190
我们可以说什么?
What would we talk about?

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,090
就我所知我们没有什么共同语言
We have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of.

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,900
你知道  我对闲谈没兴趣
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.

89
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,600
你先让我进去好吗
Can you just let me in?

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,190
没问题  但我不认为这是什么有效的努力
Well, all right, but I don't see this as a promising endeavor.

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,120
好  直接说吧
Okay, here's the deal.

92
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,630
我们要在周六给莱纳德
We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass

93
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,310
办个超级惊喜的生日派对
Surprise party for his birthday on saturday.

94
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,570
我不赞同
I hardly think so.

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,760
莱纳德说得很清楚他不想要派对
Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.

96
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,970
有人说..."派对"?
Did someone say... "party"?

97
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,650
他根本不知道他想要  因为他从来没有过
He just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one.

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,780
这倒是可能的  但申明一下
I suppose that's possible, but for the record,

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,310
我从来没玩过3P  但我仍知道我想玩
I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,850
霍华德
Howard,

101
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,840
区别在这儿...莱纳德享受一次生日派对
Here's the difference-- the possibility exists that

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,890
还有可能在地狱毁灭之前发生
Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,930
好吧  如果我真的玩3P了  我不会叫你的
Fine. if I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it.

104
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,240
我开个玩笑啦  你可以加入的
I'm just kidding. yes, you can.

105
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,030
你可以带个朋友来吗
Can you bring a friend.

106
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,030
生日派对真是个馊主意
I think a birthday party's a terrible idea.

107
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,900
我真嫉妒莱纳德从小到大能免于这份痛苦
I envy leonard for growing up without that anguish.

108
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,740
痛苦?!
Anguish?!

109
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,170
年复一年
Year after year,

110
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,100
我都得忍受戴滑稽帽子的痛苦
I had to endure wearing comical hats while being

111
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,880
然后被迫走到那又挤又满是汗臭的快乐城堡里
Forced into the crowded, sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

112
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,790
更别提要把我眼睛遮住  转几圈走到一个奇怪的熊那里
Not to mention being blindfolded and being spun toward a

113
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,470
被其他小孩子嘲笑我没有方向感
Grotesque illess donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.

114
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,760
亲爱的
Okay, sweetie,

115
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,020
我知道你有一些非专业人士无法治愈的伤疤
I understand u have scars that no nonprofeioional can heal, but,

116
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,030
但是无论如何  我们都要给莱纳德开个生日派对
Nevertheless, we're going to throw leonard a birthday party.

117
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,640
我有没有说清楚我特别不喜欢跳舞
Have I pointed out that I'm extremely uncomforblble with dancing,

118
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,690
很吵的音乐  和其他大多由酒精引起的无聊举动?
Loud music and most other forms of alcohol-induced frivolity?

119
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,810
无论如何  我们...
Nevertheless, we're...

120
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,520
另外  我真觉得莱纳德并不想...
In addition, I really don't think that leonard wtsts...

121
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,010
要么你帮我开派对  要么  上帝啊
You either you help me throw leonard a birtayay party or, so help me god,

122
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,340
我会到你的卧室里把你最值钱的
I will go into your bedroom and unbag all of your most valuable,

123
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,560
全新漫画书都倒出来
Mint-condition comic books.

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,030
然后在其中一本...你不会知道是哪本
And on one of them-- you won't know which--

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,750
-我会在上面用墨水画一个小小的笑脸  -你不能这么做
I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink. you can't do that.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,430
如果你在一本全新的漫画书上做标记  那就不是全新的了
If you make a mark in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

127
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,520
谢尔顿  你懂啥叫勒索吗?
Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?

128
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,850
当然  我明白  噢...
Well, of course, i... oh.

129
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,720
我有个想法
Yeah, I have an idea.

130
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,350
我们来给莱纳德开一个超级生日派对吧
Let's throw leonard a kick-ass birthday party.

131
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,170
这不是敲门密码
That's not the secret knock.

132
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,410
这才是敲门密码
This is the secret knock.

133
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,940
有什么区别啊?
what difference does it make?

134
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,130
设置敲门密码的所有意义就在于建立一种
The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a

135
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,010
非语言信号来验证某人的同行者身份的办法
Non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.

136
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,470
是不是拉杰和霍华德?
Is that raj and howard?

137
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,170
可能  但是还没有核对
Possibly, but unverified.

138
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,430
让我们进去不
Will you just let us in.

139
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,920
你很幸运  这并不是核反应堆
Luckily for you, this is not a nuclear reactor.

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,510
你们准备了什么生日礼物?
So what'd you get the birthday boy?

141
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,320
拉杰给他买了一个特别赞的
Well, raj got him an awesome,

142
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,210
限量版黑暗武士的雕塑
Limited edition dark knight sculpture

143
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,720
是出自阿列克斯·罗丝版本授权的蝙蝠侠
Based on alex ross's definitive batman.

144
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,580
而我送给他这份完美的  有费曼亲笔签名的
And I got him this amazing autographed copy

145
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,450
关于物理学演讲的拷贝
Of the feynman lectures on physics.

146
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,050
太棒了
Nice.

147
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,460
我要送他一件毛衣
I got him a sweater.

148
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,510
他可能会喜欢吧
Okay, well, he might like that.

149
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,130
我见过他感到冷的
I've seen him get chilly.

150
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,100
谢尔顿  我没有看到你的礼物啊
Sheldon, I didn't see your present.

151
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,790
因为我没有带礼物来
That's because I didn't bring one.

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,970
-为什么啊?  -别问
Why not? don't ask.

153
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,420
整个送礼物的机制是没有意义的
The entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense.

154
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,860
-太迟了  -比如说我花50美元给你买礼物
Too late. let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

155
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,260
我得费尽心思想你需要什么  这是件很艰苦的事情
It's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need,

156
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,640
而且你知道你需要什么
Whereas you know what you need.

157
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,980
现在  我们把事情简化  直接给你50美元
Now, I could simplify things-- just give you the $50 directly,

158
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,150
然后我生日的时候你给我50美元  这样继续下去
And then you could give me $50 on my birthday, and so on,

159
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,610
直到我们其中一个死了  留下个比你富50美元的老人
Until one of us dies, leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

160
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,830
我问问你  这样有意义吗
And I ask you, is it worth it?

161
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,680
叫你别问的
Told you not to ask.

162
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,140
谢尔顿  你是他朋友啊
Well, sheldon, you're his friend.

163
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,970
朋友之间就是互送礼物的
Friends give each other presents.

164
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,600
我同意你的论据  但不同意你的论点
I accept your premise; I reject your conclusion.

165
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,510
你试试告诉他这是一个没得选择的社交习俗
Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.

166
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,310
什么?
What?

167
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,430
照我说的做
Just do it.

168
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,990
这是一个没得选择的...
It's a non-optional...

169
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,830
社交习俗
Social convention.

170
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,010
那倒是
Oh. fair enough.

171
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,250
他很有规则性的
He came with a manual.

172
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,720
提问  我怎么在派对之前
Question-- how am I going to get leonard

173
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,590
给莱纳德准备一份礼物?
a present before the party?

174
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,630
我不会开车而且在步行范围内
I don't drive and the only things available within

175
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,770
能去的只有一家泰国菜餐馆和一个加油站
Walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station.

176
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,060
我看我能打包一份
I suppose I could wrap up an order of

177
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,210
脆炸米粉再加一些刮奖券
Mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.

178
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,760
我们这么办  我开车带谢尔顿去买礼物
Okay let's do this-- I will drive sheldon to get a present.

179
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,640
霍华德  你得让莱纳德离开房间两小时
And howard, you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours.

180
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,260
没问题
No problem.

181
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,590
然后拉杰  你把东西搬到对面
And then, raj, you bring the stuff

182
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,290
然后开始布置
across the hall and start setting up.

183
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,690
如果有客人来了怎么办?
What if guests show up?

184
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,990
招待他们
Entertain them.

185
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,930
要是是女客人怎么办?
What if they're women?

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,640
一直盯着她们  让她们觉得不舒服
Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.

187
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,710
你还好吗
How's it goin'?

188
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,700
很好
Fine.

189
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,560
听着  新艺术影院正在放映
So listen, the nuart is showing the revised,

190
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
最终修订版的银翼杀手
Definitive cut of blade runner.

191
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,510
看过了
Seen it.

192
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,780
不  你看的是25周年的最终版本
No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut.

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,480
而这个版本有八秒钟以前没看过的片断
This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage.

194
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,510
他们说这会完全改变电影的基调
They say it completely changes the tone of the film.

195
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,830
算了
Uh... pass.

196
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,170
来吧
Come on.

197
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,450
之后还有与哈里斯·福特替身的问答
Afterwards, there's a q & a with harrison ford's body double.

198
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,940
听着  我正在打光晕生命之战呢
Look, I'm in the halo battle of my life here.

199
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,420
这是个在哥本哈根的小孩  他没有免疫系统
There's this kid in copenhagen-- he has no immune system,

200
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,360
所以他24小时加7天不停地坐着打光晕
So all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24-seven.

201
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,060
你不能找别的时间跟他玩?
Can't you play him some other time?

202
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,100
如果你相信他的医生那就不能
Not if you believe his doctors.

203
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,580
天啊  闻到煤气味吗
Oh, my god, do you smell gas?

204
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,600
没有
No.

205
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,350
确实没有
Yeah, no.

206
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,840
那边有DVD播放机
You know, they have dvds over there.

207
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,130
是  但这里有DVD刻录机
Yes, but they have dvd burners over here.

208
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,100
莱纳德需要一个DVD刻录机
leonard needs a dvd burner.

209
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,480
谢尔顿  礼物不应该是一个人所需要的
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs,

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,740
而应该是一件有趣的东西
It should be something fun.

211
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,570
一件他们不会买给自己的东西
You know, something they wouldn't buy for themself.

212
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,710
你意思说比如一件毛衣?
You mean like a sweater?

213
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,480
那件毛衣很有趣的
It's a fun sweater.

214
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,730
上面有一个醒目的几何图案
It's got a bold geometric print.

215
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,600
-是几何学使它变得有趣?  -好吧...
Is it the geometry that makes it fun? okay...

216
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,220
重点是我们关心某个人的表达方式之一
The point is one of the ways we show we care about people is

217
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,320
可以是通过把想法和想象力赋予到送他的礼物中
By putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.

218
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,530
我明白了
Okay, I see.

219
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,390
-所以不能是DVD刻录机了  -没错
So, not a dvd burner exactly.

220
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,970
一件他不会买给自己的东西
Something he wouldn't buy for himself.

221
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,230
一件有趣的东西  一件像...
Something fun. something like...

222
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,570
802-11n无线路由器
An 802-11n wireless router!

223
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,590
来吧  哥本哈根男孩
Here you go, copenhagen boy.

224
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,530
尝尝汉斯·克里斯蒂安手雷的滋味吧
How about a taste of hans christian hand grenade?

225
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,580
那肯定感觉不好
Oh, that could not feel good.

226
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,550
来啊  来...
Come on, come...

227
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,020
你个聪明的...
Oh, you clever...

228
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,510
来啊  来啊
Come on. come on.

229
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,700
尝尝这个!
Take that!

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,770
怎么了?
What's the matter?

231
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,530
这个格兰诺拉燕麦卷里面有花生!
This granola bar, it has peanuts in it!

232
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,250
上帝啊  你为什么吃它呢
Oh, my god. why did you eat it?

233
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,670
我不知道  它就放在那里
I don't know. It was just there.

234
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,930
如果我有把枪放在那里  你会对自己开枪吗
if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,230
别对我吼
Don't yell at me!

236
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,700
我必须得去急诊室!
I've got to go to the emergency room!

237
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,430
-现在?  -不  等到我的舌头肿得像胸部一样!
Now?! no, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!

238
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,140
好  让我拿下钥匙
All right, uh, just let me get my keys.

239
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,470
上帝啊  上帝啊  上帝啊
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!

240
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,610
洗衣房已经没人了
The laundry is out of the hamper.

241
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,370
好  谢尔顿  那应该是什么?
Okay, sheldon, what was it supposed to be?

242
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,560
好  没有人洗衣服了!
Fine. it's out of the washer!

243
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,270
等甩干的时候我再打电话给你
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

244
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,720
好  我们走
All right, let's go.

245
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,640
你觉得呢
What do you think?

246
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,760
那个
Um, that one.

247
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
因为有两个额外的以太网接口?
Because of the two additional ethernet ports?

248
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,970
-是的  -他不需要
Sure.He doesn't need them.

249
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,040
他已经有一台六个以太网接口的交换机了
He's already got a six-port ethernet switch.

250
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,610
好吧  那这个
Oh, okay, then this one.

251
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,950
-为什么  -我不知道
Why? I don't know.

252
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,990
盒子上的男人看起来很开心
The man on the box looks so happy.

253
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,700
佩妮  如果我要给莱纳德买礼物
penny, if I'm going to buy leonard a gift,

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,430
我一定要买得合适
I'm going to do it right.

255
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,780
我不会让他经历我童年时的创伤
I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.

256
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,620
我知道我可能会后悔了  不过  什么创伤?
I know I'm gonna regret this, but what trauma?

257
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,650
我12岁生日的时候
On my 12th birthday,

258
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,920
我非常想要一个钛离心分离机
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge

259
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,320
这样  我就可以分离放射性同位素了
so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.

260
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
当然
Of course.

261
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,980
然而我父母却给我买了一个...
Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me...

262
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,030
真是难以启齿
Wow, this is hard.

263
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,280
他们给我买了一辆摩托车
They got me a motorized dirt bike.

264
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,820
不会吧
No!

265
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,090
一个怎么样的12岁男孩会要辆摩托车?
What 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?

266
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,140
所有的
All of them?

267
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,980
真的?
Really?

268
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,060
-是的  -哈
Yeah. huh.

269
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,720
好吧  我们就买这个?
Okay, so we're getting this one?

270
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,650
是吧
Yeah, I suppose.

271
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,890
好  我们走吧
All right, let's go.

272
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,370
打扰一下
Excuse me.

273
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,180
你了解这个东西吗?
Do you know anything about this stuff?

274
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,360
我了解它的一切
I know everything about this stuff.

275
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,170
太好了
Okay,

276
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,700
我个人在开展鲜花批发业务
I have my own whwholesale flower business

277
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,700
我想把我的前台计算机
and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance

278
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,400
和冷藏库的计算机连在一起
with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.

279
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,220
这个  看  我们就买的这个
Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting.

280
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
看  他很开心
See? happy guy.

281
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,690
不  不  不  她不需要那个
No, no, no, she doesn't want that.

282
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,090
她需要一个扩大范围的点对点网络
She needs a point-to-point peer network with a range extender.

283
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,020
我应该选哪一个硬盘  火线还是USB?
Which hard drive do I want-- firewire or usb?

285
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,970
这取决于你有什么总线(bus还有大巴士的意思)
It depends on what bus you have available.

286
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,210
我开的是雪佛兰跑车
I drive a chevy cavalier.

287
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,810
真主啊
Oh, dear lord.

288
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,890
-谢尔顿  我们该走了  -现在不行  佩妮
Sheldon, we have to go. not now, penny.

289
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,110
这位可怜人需要我的帮助
This poor man needs me.

290
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,770
你等一下  我马上招呼你
You, hold on. I'll be right with you.

291
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,020
你计算机是什么样的?
What computer do you have?

292
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,650
请不要说是一台白色的
And please don't say "a white one."

293
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,020
打扰一下
Excuse me.

294
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,420
把这个填好  找个座位坐下
Fill this out. have a seat.

295
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,980
不  听着
No, listen.

296
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,030
我们打算给我的朋友开一个惊喜派对
We're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm

297
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,940
而我要让我朋友离开公寓两小时
Supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.

298
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,340
把这个填好  找个座位坐下
Uh-huh. fill this out and have a seat.

299
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,030
不
No, see,

300
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,860
我能让他离开的唯一办法就是告诉他
The only way I could get him to leave was to tell

301
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,470
我吃了一个花生  因为我对花生过敏
Him I ate a peanut because I'm allergic to peanuts.

302
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,020
这样的话  把这个填好找个座位坐下
Oh. well, in that case, fill this out and have a seat.

303
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,980
听着
Look,

304
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,000
我只要你把我带到后面去  给我一张创可贴
All I need from you is to take me in the back, give me a band-aid  and

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,450
这样我就可以假装打了一针肾上腺素
So I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine

306
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,180
然后你告诉我朋友你需要让我
And then you tell my friend you need to keep me

307
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,530
留在这观察一小时  一个半小时
under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.

308
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,860
没有别的了吗?
Is that all you need?

309
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,750
-没了  -给我滚出急诊室
Yes. get out of my er.

310
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,070
不  你不明白
No, you don't understand.

311
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,510
我明白  但是不好意思
Oh, I understand, but unfortunately,

312
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,130
我们医院不接待傻子
This hospalal is not equipped to treat stupid.

313
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,290
好吧  我知道了
Okay, I get it.

314
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,590
我知道这个世界的规则
I know how the world works.

315
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,680
不如介绍你认识一下赋予你们自由的领袖吧?
How about if I were to introduce to you to the man who freed your people?

316
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,110
除非我们的领袖是本杰明·富兰克林
Unless my people were freed by benjamin franklin

317
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,980
还有他五个孪生兄弟  否则你是在浪费时间
And his five twin brothers, you are wasting your time.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
对不起  停车位太难找了
Hey, sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,930
-你怎么样了  -非常糟糕
-How are you doing? -bad, very bad.

320
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,890
真的?  你看上去像完全没有吃过什么一样
Really? you don't look like you're swelling up at all.

321
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,650
不如我们就去药店拿点伤风抗素剂然后回家吧
Maybe we should just pick up some benadryl at the drugstore and go home.

322
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,360
-我们不能回家  -为什么
We can't go home. why not?

323
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,650
因为...因为...
Becaus.... because...

324
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,470
我的胸痛!  胸痛!
Brisket! brisket!

325
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,150
-水  我要水  -我马上拿来
Water! need water! I'll be right back.

326
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,210
佩妮  我遇到状况了
penny, listen, I've got a problem.

327
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,410
我这里也是
Yeah, well, so do i.

328
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,140
听着  你得再拖住莱纳德一会
Look, you gotta stall leonard a little longer.

329
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,270
我认为我办不到了
I don't think I can.

330
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,020
你必须办到  我们一定要同时回去喊"惊喜"
You have to. we all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise.

331
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,620
好吧  你必须明白
Okay, you have to understand something.

332
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,280
我们现在还在医院
We're in a hospital right now.

333
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,540
为什么  莱纳德还好吧
Why? is leonard okay?

334
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,420
他很好  我也很好
Leonard's fine. I'm fine.

335
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,260
顺便感谢你的关心
Thanks for asking, by the way.

336
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,850
好了  我不需要你表达什么态度
Okay, I don't need your attitude.

337
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,920
听着  就再拖一会
Listen, just hold him there a little longer.

338
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,700
不行  我应经尽力了
Look, I've done my best,

339
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,010
但是他想回家  我不知道该怎么做
But he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.

340
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,160
好吧  那这样
Ok, , how about this?

341
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
你如果能再拖一会  等你到了派对上
You keep him there a little longer, and when you get to the party,

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,210
我会给你介绍我最容易上手的朋友
I'll point out which of my friends are easy?

343
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,630
不要耍我  女人
Don't toy with me, woman.

344
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,980
我有个以前非常胖没有自信而现在辣得不行的朋友
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem,

345
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,920
还有个到处和男人上床气坏老爸的朋友
I got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and

346
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,550
以及一个喝两杯鸡尾酒
Alcoholi who's two tequila shots

347
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,440
就任人摆布的朋友
Away from letting you wear her like a hat.

348
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,790
我会搞定一切的
Thy will be done.

349
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,630
一切都是为了你  小弟弟
I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

350
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,560
我们库存也没有了
Okay, we don't have that in stock...

351
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,180
不过我可以为你特别定一个
But I can special-order it for you.

352
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,110
就是他
Him.

353
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,630
抱歉  先生  你不是工作人员
Excuse me, sir. you don't work here.

354
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,370
是  当然  但这里没工作人员
Yes, well, apparently, neither does anyone else.

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,330
-谢尔顿  我们得走了  -为什么
Sheldon, we have to go why?

356
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,700
一方面  莱纳德的派对要开始了
Well, for one thing, we're late for leonard's birthday party,

357
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,720
另一方面  我已经让他去叫保安了
And for another, I told him to call security.

358
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,600
祝你好运
Good luck.

359
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,450
顺便提一下  一个6岁男孩都可以侵入你们的电脑
By the way, a six-year-old could hack your cocomputer system.

360
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,630
快走吧
Keep walking.

361
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,880
"1234"不是一个安全的密码
"1234" is not a secure password.

362
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,890
不好意思  我朋友他花生过敏了
Excusee-e-- my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.

363
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,210
没  他没有
No, he's not.

364
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,180
是的  他是的
Yes, he is.

365
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,150
先生  是这样  我们很忙  而且...
Look, sir, we are very busy here, and i...

366
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,700
我的天啊
Holy crap!

367
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,490
快来人!
Please help me!

368
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,520
4号  我需要个轮床
Cocode four! I need a gurney!

369
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,570
马上  马上
Right away! right away!

370
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,810
谢谢
thank you.

371
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,540
对于这个国家的健康保健系统  你可以随便说啥
Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country,

372
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,570
假使他们害怕诉讼  他们得保证检测过所有东西
But when they're afraid of lawsuits, they sure test everything.

373
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,540
我真不觉得肠窥镜有任何必要
I really don't think the colonoopopy was necessary.

374
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,060
你知道嘛  在你症状出现之前
You know, before you got all swollen up,

375
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,920
我还以为你是要让我离开家
I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of

376
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,940
这样你们可以为我准备惊喜派对
The apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.

377
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,220
想起来了  今天是你的生日
Oh, right, it's your birthday.

378
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,580
我都忘了是你生日
I had no idea it was your birthday.

379
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,480
完全忘了
I completely forgot.

380
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,830
这个生日过得还真糟糕
Wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday.

381
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,200
不过  反正都过去了
Well, it's all over now.

382
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,370
是有个派对  是吗
There is a party, isn't there?

383
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,080
可能
Maybe.

384
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,030
霍华德
Howard?

385
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,500
你生气了?
Are you mad?

386
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,370
我怎么可能生气
How could I be mad??

387
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,910
你都冒了生命危险就因为你关心在乎我
You actually risked your life because you care about me.

388
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,740
-当然  就是因为这个  -好吧
Yeah, that's why I did it all right.

389
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,710
进去吧
Here we go.

390
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,220
我的第一个生日派对
My first birthday party.

391
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,870
伙计  大伙一个小时前就都走了
Dude, everybody left an hour ago.

392
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,910
惊喜!
Surprise!

393
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,080
莱纳德  我现在就在你的生日派对上
Okay, leonard, here I am on your birthday party.

394
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,010
我不知道你在哪  但这真的很棒!
I don't know where you are, dude, but it's really kick-ass!

395
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,930
每个人都烂醉如泥
Everyone is very, very drunk and...

396
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,070
看  有个女孩把上衣脱了!
Oh, and look, there's a girl taking her shirt off!

397
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,430
那是我的朋友卡萝尔
That's my friend carol.

398
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,090
提醒我  我要把她介绍给霍华德
Remind me-- I gotta introduce her to howard.

399
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,090
可爱的卡丽什娜  把卢布制造机晃起来!
Oh, sweet krishna, shake that rupee maker!

400
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,050
