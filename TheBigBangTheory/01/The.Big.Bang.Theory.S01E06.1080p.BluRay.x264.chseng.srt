1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,700
既然没人愿意承认 那就让我来吧
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,050
我们的彩蛋射击技术逊毙了
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,050
简直丢脸丢到家
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,200
哦 拜托 胜败乃兵家常事啊
Oh, come on. Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,960
可也不能输给凯尔那帮犹太小男生啊
Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,450
我想我们得承认
I think we have to acknowledge,

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,870
对方手段太野蛮了
those were some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,080
不 我们的惨败是源于我们自己的无能
No,we were annihilated by our own incompetence

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,150
以及某些人没有能够听从指挥
and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,800
谢尔顿 别再计较了!
Sheldon,let it go!

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,420
不行 我想说说沃罗威茨从背后袭击我的事
No,I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,970
我有充分的理由
I shot you for good reason.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,230
你正把我们引向灾难之中
You were leading us into disaster.

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,690
我的命令清晰而且明确
I was giving clear,concise orders.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,060
你躲在树后面喊 "打那个戴帽子的小孩!
You hid behind a tree yelling,"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,250
"打那个戴帽子的小孩!"
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,460
嗨 你们好
Oh,hey,guys.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,400
- 嗨 佩妮 - 早上好 女士
-Oh,hey,Penny. Hello. -Morning,ma'am.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,770
游戏如何 好玩吗?
So,how was paintball?Did you have fun?

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,130
当然 如果你觉得被自己人暗算也开心的话
Sure,if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,330
你最好把日程空出来 我会就此事提出质询的
You clear space on your calendar--there will be an inquiry.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,650
好吧
Okay.

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,920
对了 周六我会开个派对
Um,hey,I'm having a party on Saturday,

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,540
你们有空的话 不如一起过来玩吧
so if you guys are around,you should come on by.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,750
- 派对? - 是啊
-A party? -Yeah.

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,380
是... ‘男女’ 派对?
A... "boy-girl" party?

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,190
呃...肯定有男生 也肯定有女生 而且也是场派对
Well,there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party,so...

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,320
其实也就是邀请一帮朋友
It'll just be a bunch of my friends.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,290
喝喝啤酒 跳跳舞
We'll have some beer,do a little dancing.

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,180
跳舞?
Dancing?

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,590
嗯 我不能确定 佩妮...
Yeah,I don't know,Penny...

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,560
其实 我们不太...
The thing is,we're not...

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,940
- 我们更适合...  - 不行
-No,we're really more of a... -No.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,110
不过谢谢你能邀请我们
But thanks.Thanks for thinking of us.

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,230
确信吗? 来嘛 万圣节哦
Are you sure? Come on,it's Halloween.

36
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,590
万圣节派对?
A Halloween party?

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,180
化妆舞会吗?
As in... costumes?

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,140
当然了
Well,yeah.

39
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,940
有主题吗?
Is there a theme?

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,400
呃 万圣节咯
Um,yeah,Halloween.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,920
是的 不过服装是随自己意呢 还是有风格限制的?
Yes,but are the costumes random,or genre-specific?

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,390
和以前一样 我还是没听懂
As usual,I'm not following.

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,690
他是想问 我们能不能打扮成科幻片里面的人物 ...
He's asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction,fantasy...

44
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,080
- 当然  - 漫画里的人呢?
-Sure.  -What about comic books?

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,110
- 当然   - 动漫?
-Fine.  -Anime?

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,890

Anything you want! Okay?

49
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,010
怎么样打扮都行
Any costume you want.

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,340
再见
Bye.

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,020
各位 向缝纫机前进!
Gentlemen,to the sewing machines.

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,820
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第06集
The.Middle.Earth.Paradigm

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,030
我来开
I'll get it.

54
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,090
哦 不
Oh,no.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,730
哦 不
Oh,no.

56
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,390
给世界上速度最快的人让路了!
Make way for the fastest man alive!

57
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,760
哦 不
Oh,no.

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,640
看吧 我都说了应该先开会讨论一下嘛
See,this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,600
我们还有别的服装 换一下就可以了
We all have other costumes: We can change.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,190
或者我们可以整晚都保持一列纵队
Or we could walk right behind each other all night

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,810
看起来就像是一个人在快速移动
and look like one person going really fast.

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,720
不不不
No,no,no.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,140
这是男女派对 闪电侠得单独行动
It's a boy-girl party,this flash runs solo.

64
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,510
不如这样
Okay,how about this?

65
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,770
谁都不许穿成闪电侠
Nobody gets to be The Flash.

66
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,490
全部去换掉 如何?
We all change. Agreed?

67
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,890
同意
Agreed.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,220
我要扮弗拉多!  (电影<魔戒>中人物)
I call Frodo!

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,600
该死!
Damn!

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,670
嘿
Hey.

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,090
抱歉迟到 我的锤子被公交车门卡住了
Sorry I'm late,but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.

72
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,430
你要扮雷神托尔?
You went with Thor?

73
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,240
怎么 印度人就不能扮北欧神祗了吗?
What,just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse god?

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,400
"不不 拉杰只能演印度神仙"
"No,no,Raj has to be an Indian god."

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,870
这是种族歧视
That's racism.

76
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,910
我说 看看沃罗威茨 他也不是英国人
I mean look at Wolowitz.He's not English,

77
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,770
可是他打扮成了彼得·潘
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,870
谢尔顿既不是声波也不是光波
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,790
但很明显 他穿成了多普勒效应
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,730
我不是彼得潘
I'm not Peter Pan.

81
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,510
我是罗宾汉
I'm Robin Hood.

82
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,430
是啊?
Really?

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,750
我看过彼得潘 你穿的和凯西·瑞比一模一样
Because I sawPeter Pan,and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.
著名百老汇演员 在舞台上饰演该角色24年之久

84
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,210
她比你大了一号 不过造型完全一样 伙计
She was a little bigger than you,but it's basically the same look,man.

85
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,780
谢尔顿
Hey,Sheldon

86
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,920
派对开始前我得先和你谈谈
There's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,550
我不管别人看不看得懂
I don't care if anybody gets it.

88
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,230
我就是要穿成多普勒效应
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

89
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,170
- 我不是要说这个  - 如果有必要 我会当场演示
-No,it's not that. -If I have to,I can demonstrate.

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,090
好极了
Terrific.

91
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,130
这次派对是佩妮第一次
this party is my first chance for Penny

92
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,860
邀请我加入她的社交圈
to see me in the context of her social group,

93
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,140
我希望你今晚不能给我难堪
and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,740
你说让你难堪是什么意思?
Well,what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?

95
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,830
比方说 今天晚上
Well,for example,tonight,

96
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,180
没人需要知道我的中间名是里克
no one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.

97
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,240
这和难堪根本一点关系也没有
But there's nothing embarrassing about that.

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,630
你父亲曾经和伟大的人类学家路易斯·里克一起工作过
Your father worked with Louis Leakey, a great anthropologist.

99
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,380
跟你尿床的事一点关系也没有
It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.

100
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,600
总之我的意思是 这次派对是大好机会
All m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,040
佩妮可以把我当成她的同伴看待
to see me as a member of her peer group,

102
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,650
一个潜在的亲密好友 或许还能更进一步
a potential close friend,and perhaps more,

103
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,730
我不想看起来像一个怪胎
and I don't want to look like a dork.

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,580
先告诉你们 各位
Just a heads up,fellas.

105
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,500
如果有谁交了好运 我的箭筒里有一打套套
If anyone gets lucky,I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

106
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,750
嗨 各位
Oh,hey,guys.

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,430
嘿 对不起来晚了
Hey. Sorry we're late.

108
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,330
晚?
Late?

109
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,540
才7:05呢
It's 7:05.

110
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,730
你说过派对7点开始
And you said the party starts at 7:00.

111
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,860
没错 可是如果派对定在7点
Well,yeah,I mean,when you start a party at 7:00,

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,570
没人会7点就入场
no one shows up at,you know,7:00.

113
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,680
已经7:05了
It's 7:05.

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,390
是是 没错
Yes. Yes,it is.

115
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,240
好吧 请进
Okay. Well,um,come on in.

116
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,630
怎么 女生全部去了洗手间吗?
So,what,are all the girls in the bathroom?

117
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,980
很有可能 她们自己家里的洗手间
Probably,but in their own homes.

118
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,460
那个...服装展示什么时候开始?
So,what time does the costume parade start?

119
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,290
展示?
The parade?

120
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,430
对啊 这样评委可以给最佳造型颁奖
Yeah,so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume.

121
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,320
比如最吓人奖 最逼真奖
You know,most frightening,most authentic,

122
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,180
科学原理演示之最佳视觉效果奖
most accurate visualization of a scientific principal.

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,380
真抱歉 谢尔顿
Oh,Sheldon,I'm sorry,

124
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,760
可是不会有什么展示
but there aren't going to be any parades

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,200
评委或在奖品什么的
or judges or prizes.

126
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,240
这派对一定会很糟糕的
This party is just going to suck.

127
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,370
不！拜托 一定会好玩的
No! Come on,it's going to be fun,

128
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,420
你们看起来都棒极了
and you all look great.

129
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,030
看 你是雷神托尔
I mean,look at you,Thor,

130
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,690
还有~ 彼得·潘 这太可爱了
and,oh,Peter Pan. That's so cute.

131
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,850
- 其实上 佩妮 他是罗宾汉  - 我是彼得·潘
-Actually,Penny,he's Robin Hood. -I'm Peter Pan.

132
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,810
我手里还有一把有你名字的魔法粉
And I got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,890
你才没有
No,you don't.

134
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,910
呃 谢尔顿穿的是什么?
Uh,hey,what's Sheldon supposed to be?

135
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,250
哦 他那是多普勒效应
Oh,he's the Doppler effect.

136
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,100
当声源和观察者之间的距离发生变化时
Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave

137
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,680
波动的频率也会发生明显变化
caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.

138
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,580
哦 我知道了
Oh,sure,I see it now.

139
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,690
多普勒效应嘛
The Doppler effect.

140
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,670
好的 我得去洗澡了
All right,I got to shower.

141
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,810
你们 自己好好玩吧
You guys,um,make yourselves comfortable.

142
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,510
好的
Okay.

143
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,690
瞧见没? 人们能明白的
See? People get it.

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,230
以奥丁的胡子起誓 实在太好吃了
By Odin's beard,this is good Chex mix.
奥丁 北欧神话中的主神

145
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,790
不用了 谢谢 有花生
No,thanks. Peanuts.

146
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,910
穿这么紧 我可不能肿起来
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

147
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,300
我搞不懂
I'm confused.

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,900
如果没有服装展示 我们在这干吗?
If there's no costume parade,what are we doing here?

149
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,220
参与社交活动啊 认识新朋友
We're socializing,meeting new people.

150
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,820
靠传心术吗?
Telepathically?

151
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,510
嗨 你们什么时候来的?
Oh,hey,when did you get here?

152
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,490
嗨
Hi.

153
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,380
佩妮的那件猫女装是我见过最丑的
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

154
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,740
比哈里·贝瑞还差
And that includes Halle Berry's.
哈里·贝瑞 她曾因<猫女>一片勇夺金酸梅最差女主角

155
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,670
她不是猫女 只是一只普通的猫
She's not Catwoman. She's just a generic cat.

156
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,610
正是由于竞争机制的缺乏
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming

157
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,490
才会导致这种三流造型的出现
which results from a lack of rules and competion.

158
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,690
嘿 快瞧那个性感小护士
Hey,guys,check out the sexy nurse.

159
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,070
我相信是时候采取行动了
I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.

160
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,990
你准备怎么做?
What is your move?

161
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,210
采取镜子战术
I'm going to use the mirror technique.

162
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,210
她拨她的头发 我就拨我的
She brushes her hair back,I brush my hair back...

163
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,230
她耸肩 我也耸肩
She shrugs,I shrug.

164
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,010
她下意识里就会觉得 我们心有灵犀 注定是一对
Subconsciously she's thinking,"We're in sync. We belong together."

165
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,430
你哪学来的这一套?
Where do you get this stuff?

166
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,370
心理学期刊 国际性研究
You know,psychology journals,Internet research,

167
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,100
而且在VH-1台上也有教如何追求女孩的好节目
and there's this great show on VH-1 about how to pick up girls.

168
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
我有他那么自信就好了
Oh,if only I had his confidence.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,020
我跟女人说话都困难 呆在女生旁边也是...
I have such difficulty speaking to women,or around women...

170
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,170
甚至包括娘娘腔的男人
or at times even effeminate men.

171
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
如果那个听诊器能正常使用
If that's a working stethoscope,

172
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,620
或许你想听听我击鼓般的心跳声?
maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?

173
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,910
不用了
No,thanks.

174
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,950
我说真的 我有瞬间自发性心律失常
No,seriously,you can.I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

175
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,830
我想去认识佩妮的朋友们
I want to get to know Penny's friends,

176
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,710
我只是… 但我不知道该怎么和这些人说话
I just… I don't know how to talk to these people.

177
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,980
这点上 我可能会帮上忙
Well,I actually might be able to help.

178
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,060
怎么说?
How so?

179
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,550
就像珍·古德观察黑猩猩一样
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes,
英国科学家 以对黑猩猩的研究闻名世界

180
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,220
我发现一开始他们之间的互动是混乱且无组织性的
I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured.

181
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,680
但渐渐有模式可循
But patterns emerge.

182
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,600
他们有自己独特的语言
They have their own language,if you will.

183
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,510
继续
Go on.

184
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,860
新来的人在接近现有的一伙聊天的人时 会说
Well,it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting,

185
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,760
"我看起来喝醉了吗?"
"How wasted am I?"

186
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,740
然后就会有一阵类似“伙计”之类的欢迎声
Which is met with an approving chorus of "Dude."

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
然后呢?
Then what happens?

188
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,360
我只观察到这些
That's as far as I've gotten.

189
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,180
真是荒谬
This is ridiculous.

190
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,480
我准备上了
I'm jumping in.

191
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,370
祝你好运
Good luck.

192
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,810
不 你跟我一起
No,you're coming with me.

193
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,200
我可不这么想
Oh,I hardly think so.

194
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,740
拜托
Oh,come on.

195
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,490
你不怕我给你难堪?
Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?

196
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,110
怕 可我需要一个副手
Yes; but I need a wing man.
wingman:原意指护航的飞机

197
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,050
好吧 可是如果要拿飞行来做比喻的话
All right,but if we're going to use flight metaphors,

198
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,240
我更适合联邦航空局事故调查员的角色
I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

199
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,400
嗨
Hi.

200
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,020
- 嗨 - 你好
Hi. Hello.

201
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,010
你这身是扮的是什么?
So what are you supposed to be?

202
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,560
我? 我给点提示
Me? I'll give you a hint.

203
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,350
玩具火车?
A choo-choo train?

204
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,090
接近了!
Close!

205
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,610
一列脑震荡的火车?
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

206
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,900
我看起来喝醉了吗?
How wasted am I?

207
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
我还是不懂
I still don't get it.

208
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,900
我是多普勒效应
I'm the Doppler effect.

209
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,070
如果这是指一种"学习障碍"
Okay,if that's some sort of learning disability,

210
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,970
那么你也模仿得太烂了
I think it's very insensitive.

211
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,290
为什么不跟别人说你是只斑马呢?
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?

212
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,500
那你怎么不告诉人家你是 七个小矮人之一?
Well,why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?

213
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,720
因为我是弗拉多
Because I'm Frodo.

214
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,080
没错 很好 因为我是多普勒效应
Yes,well,I'm the Doppler effect.

215
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,100
- 不会吧 - 怎么了?
-Oh,no.  -What?

216
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,070
那是佩妮的前男友
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

217
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,020
他来这里干吗?
What do you suppose he's doing here?

218
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,670
干扰这里的重力场吗?
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

219
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,070
他要是再大块点 月亮都会绕着他转
If he were any bigger,he'd have moons orbiting him.

220
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,800
你真刻薄
Oh,snap.

221
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,330
那么 我们似乎该走了
So,I guess we'll be leaving now.

222
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,230
为什么要我们走?
Why should we leave?

223
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,080
很明显他是不请自来 佩妮看都不想看他
For all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,150
还有后备的假设吗?
You have a backup hypothesis?

225
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,620
也许他们只是想做回朋友
Maybe they want to be friends.

226
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,500
又或者她想做朋友 而他想要更多
Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.

227
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,710
那么他和我就在同一高度
Then he and I are on equal ground.

228
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,090
没错 但你比他更接近地面
Yes,but you're much closer to it than he is.

229
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,780
如果是1500年前
Look,if this was 1,500 years ago,

230
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,700
凭他的体格和力量
by virtue of his size and strength,

231
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,250
科特想挑选哪个女人都可以
Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.

232
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,500
还有男人 动物 巨型远古茄子
And male partners,animal partners, large primordial eggplants--

233
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,250
几乎所有他想要的东西
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

234
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,490
没错 但现在的社会已经发生了根本的转换
Yes,but our society has undergone a paradigm shift.

235
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,430
在信息时代 谢尔顿
In the Information Age,Sheldon,

236
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,910
你和我才是最优秀的
you and I are the alpha males.

237
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,720
我们不该退缩
We shouldn't have to back down.

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,610
是的
True.

239
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,880
你干吗不发短信给他看他会不会退缩?
Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?

240
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,160
不
No.

241
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,350
我要面对面向他展现我的优势
I'm going to assert my dominance face-to-face.

242
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,770
面对面? 你是要他坐下
Face-to-face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down,

243
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,560
还是自己站在咖啡桌上?
or are you going to stand on the coffee table?

244
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,860
嗨 佩妮
Hello,Penny.

245
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,760
嗨 科特
Hello,Kurt.

246
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,840
嗨 你们玩得还好吗?
Oh,hey,guys,are you having a good time?

247
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,090
鉴于人们对我扮相的反应
Given the reaction to my costume,

248
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,670
这次派对是对美国教育制度的严厉控诉
this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.

249
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,480
你是斑马 对吧?
What,you're a zebra,right?

250
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,360
有一个低能儿童
Yet another child left behind.

251
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,850
你又是什么 精灵?
And what are you supposed to be,an elf?

252
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,300
不 我是霍比特人
No,I'm a hobbit.

253
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,970
有什么不同?
What's the difference?

254
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,860
霍比特人是居住在中土世界 生命有限的矮人
A hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth,

255
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,430
而精灵则是永生而高大的战士
whereas an elf is an immortal,tall warrior.

256
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,540
那你为什么要做个矮人呢?
So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?

257
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
因为他既不高也会死
Because he's neither tall nor immortal

258
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,170
而且我们没有人可以做闪电侠
and none of us could be The Flash.

259
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,790
随你怎说
Well,whatever.

260
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,750
不如你们赶紧消失
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

261
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,230
我正和佩妮说话呢
I'm talking to Penny here.

262
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,170
我想我们都在和佩妮说话
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

263
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,760
我没有 我没恶意
I'm not. No offense.

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,410
好吧 可能你没听懂我意思
Okay,maybe you didn't hear me.

265
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,650
- 滚蛋 - 好啦 科特 有礼貌点
-Go away.  -All right,Kurt,be nice.

266
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,400
我很有礼貌
Oh,I am being nice.

267
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,150
对不对 小朋友?
Right,little buddy?

268
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,370
- 科特 - 好吧
-Kurt.  -Okay.

269
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,690
我明白你企图用武力来恐吓我
I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me.

270
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,220
因为你在智力上无法和我匹敌
I mean,you can't compete with me on an intellectual level

271
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,190
所以你只能选择这种动物似的方式
so you're driven to animalistic puffery.

272
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,690
你是说 我是动物吗?
You calling me a puffy animal?

273
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,650
当然不是啦 不 他不是
Of course not. No,he's not.

274
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,950
你不是 对吧 莱纳德?
You're not,right,Leonard?

275
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,640
不 我是说"动物似的"
No,I said "animalistic."

276
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
当然我们都是动物
Of course we're all animals,

277
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,790
只不过我们当中一些人 在进化树上爬得更高一些
but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

278
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,070
要是他听懂了 你就完蛋了
If he understands that,you're in trouble.

279
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,140
所以怎样 你说我没进化吗?
So,what,I'm unevolved?

280
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,300
你完蛋了
You're in trouble.

281
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,680
作为一个侏儒 你用的词还真够大的
You know,you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.

282
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,360
好吧 科特 别这样
Okay,Kurt,please.

283
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,480
佩妮 没关系 我可以处理
Penny,it's okay. I can handle this.

284
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,190
我不是侏儒
I am not a dwarf,

285
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,860
我是霍比特人
I'm a hobbit.

286
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,130
一个霍比特人...
A hobbit.

287
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,010
你大脑海马区里坏掉的神经元
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion

288
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,550
阻碍了短期记忆到长期记忆的转换吗
from short-term to long-term memory?

289
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,190
好吧 现在你惹火我了
Okay,now you're starting to make me mad.

290
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,420
一个发现自己可对立拇指的人猿说什么?
A homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?

291
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,680
什么?
What?

292
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,310
我想我已经说得很清楚了
I think I've made my point.

293
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,720
是吗? 不如我在你的小脑袋上 凿个洞让你更清楚点?
Yeah? How about I make a point out of your pointy little head?

294
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
我要提醒你 尽管精神上我绝对支持你
Let me remind you,while my moral support is absolute,

295
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,610
但在肢体冲突上 我的作用是零
in a physical confrontation,I will be less than useless.

296
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,790
根本就不会有什么冲突的
There's not going to be a confrontation.

297
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,090
说实话 我怀疑他能不能拼 "冲突"这个单词
In fact,I doubt if he can even spell "confrontation."

298
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,810
C-O-N...
C-O-N...

299
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,120
frontation!
frontation!

300
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,080
科特 马上放他下来
Kurt,put him down this instant!

301
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,090
他先惹我的
He started it!

302
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,290
我不管 我想结束这事 总之放下他
I don't care. I'm finishing it.Put him down!

303
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,220
好吧
Fine.

304
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,250
算你个妖精走运
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

305
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,260
他是霍比特人!
He's a hobbit!

306
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,590
我顶你
I got your back.

307
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,080
莱纳德 你没事吧?
Leonard,are you okay?

308
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,430
我很好
Yeah,I'm fine.

309
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,810
这派对很棒 谢谢你邀请我们
It's good,it's a good party,thanks for having us.

310
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,940
时间也不早了 所以...
It's just getting a little late,so...

311
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,540
好吧
Oh,okay.

312
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,250
好吧 谢谢你们能来
All right,well,thank you for coming.

313
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,480
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

314
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,670
如果这也算安慰的话
If it's any consolation,

315
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,970
我想说 你那句"人猿"的确很适合他
I thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place.

316
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,690
那是什么?
What's that?

317
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,460
茶
Tea.

318
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,930
当人们沮丧的时候
When people are upset,

319
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,940
传统上应该给他们一点热饮
the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages.

320
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,470
好啦 好啦
There,there.

321
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,620
要谈谈吗?
You want to talk about it?

322
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,840
- 不 - 太好了
-No.  -Good.

323
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,720
我能说的也只有"好啦 好啦"了
"There,there" was really all I had.

324
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,230
晚安 谢尔顿
Good night,Sheldon.

325
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,280
晚安 莱纳德
Good night,Leonard.

326
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,690
嘿 莱纳德?
Hey,Leonard?

327
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,970
嗨 佩妮
Hi,Penny.

328
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,930
我只是来看看你有没事
Hey,I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

329
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,500
我很好
I'm fine.

330
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,890
刚才的事真不好意思
I am so sorry about what happened.

331
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,620
那不是你的错
It's not your fault.

332
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,800
不 怪我
Yes,it is.

333
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,230
这就是我和他分手的原因
That's why I broke up with him.

334
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,480
他总是这样
He always does stuff like that.

335
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,770
那他怎么会出现在派对上?
So why was he at your party?

336
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,500
上周我碰见他 他道歉说他已经变了
Well,I ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he's changed.

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,860
他不停的说啊说…
And he was just going on and on and...

338
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,530
我就相信了 我真是个笨蛋
I believed him and I'm an idiot

339
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,570
因为我总是那么容易相信那种男人
because I always believe guys like that.

340
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,900
我根本不想回去 因为他还待在那
And I can't go back to my party because he's there.

341
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,630
我知道你不想听这些 但我很伤心
And know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset

342
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,320
还喝醉了 我只想...
and I'm really drunk and I just want to...

343
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,130
好啦 好啦
There,there.

344
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,550
天啊 我做错什么了吗?
God,what is wrong with me?

345
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,180
没有 你很完美
Nothing,you're perfect.

346
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,730
我不完美
I'm not perfect.

347
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,120
不 你是
Yes,you are.

348
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,470
你真的这么想?
You really think so,don't you?

349
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,380
佩妮?
Penny?

350
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,430
恩?
Yeah?

351
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,930
你今晚喝了多少?
How much have you had to drink tonight?

352
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,900
就...很多
Just... a lot.

353
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,390
你确信你不是因为喝醉酒而且对科特的事生气
Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt

354
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,360
现在才这样做吗
doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?

355
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,780
可能有吧
It might.

356
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,860
你太聪明了
Boy,you're really smart.

357
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,540
是啊 我TMD就是个天才
Yeah,I'm a frickin' genius.

358
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,170
莱纳德 你真是太好了
Leonard,you are so great.

359
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,110
为什么男人都不能像你这样？
Why can't all guys be like you?

360
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,690
如果是那样的话
Because if all guys were like me,

361
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,320
人类就无法繁衍了
the human race couldn't survive.

362
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,210
我想我该走了
I should probably go.

363
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,840
是的
Probably.

364
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,140
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,880
是的 你没看错
That's right,you saw what you saw.

366
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,570
我们在夏尔也是这么狂欢的
That's how we roll in the Shire.
<魔戒>中弗拉多的家乡

367
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,780
来了
Coming.

368
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,900
嘿 看见库萨帕里了吗?
Hey,have you seen Koothrappali?

369
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,640
他不在这
He's not here.

370
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,290
也许复仇者们把他召走了
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

371
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,530
他不是神奇漫画里那个雷神 是北欧神话里那个雷神
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,he's the original Norse god.

372
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,010
多谢你的解释
Thank you for the clarification.

373
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,300
我本来要送他回家的
I'm supposed to give him a ride home.

374
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
放心吧 我相信他没事的
Well,I'm sure he'll be fine.

375
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,300
他带着锤子呢
He has his hammer.

376
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,670
我得承认 你太了不起了
I have to say,you are an amazing man.

377
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,210
温柔 有激情
You're gentle,and passionate.

378
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,110
而且 上帝啊 你还是个超好的倾听者
And,my God,you are such a good listener.
