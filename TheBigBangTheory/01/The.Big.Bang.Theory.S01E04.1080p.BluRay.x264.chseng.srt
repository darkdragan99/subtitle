1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,460
我最近又在想着时光旅行的事了
you know,I've been thinking about time travel again.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,280
为什么 你又撞上看不见的障碍物了?
Why,did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,840
先不说那个
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,390
我想到 如果我发明了完美的时间机器
Anyway,it occurs to me if I ever did perfect a time machine,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,610
我会回到过去把它送给自己
I would just go into the past and give it to myself,

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,270
省得要自己再去发明它一次
thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,980
不错
Interesting.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,170
是啊 这样能让我减压不少
Yeah,it really takes the pressure off.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,790
听起来像是个大突破
Sounds like a breakthrough.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,390
要我打电话给科学杂志 让他们留下头版的位置吗?
Should I call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,270
这可是时间旅行 莱纳德 过去的我已经打过了
It's time travel,leonard,I will have already done that.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,830
那我想就等着祝贺你啦
Then I guess congratulations are in order.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,400
不 过去的你已经祝贺过我了
No,congratulations will have been in order.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,940
我肯定在派对上不会开心的
You know,I am not going to enjoy this party.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,490
我知道 我太了解你
I know,I'm familiar with you.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,120
上次系里的派对 芬克顿教授抓着我
The last department party,professor finkleday cornered me

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,590
讨论洞穴探险 一直说了45分钟
and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,880
是的 我也在场
Yes,I was there.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,800
你知道窑洞有什么意思吗 莱纳德?
You know what's interesting about caves,leonard?

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,500
- 什么? - 什么也没有
- What? - Nothing.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,770
那我们躲开他 去见到新的系主任
Well,then we'll avoid finkleday,we'll meet the new department head,

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,550
恭喜他 跟他握手 然后就走
congratulate him,shake his hand and go.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,690
这样如何?
How's this?

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,650
"见到你很高兴 盖博豪斯博士"
"Pleased to meet you,dr.Gablehauser.

25
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,620
"您真幸运 学校雇了你做系主任"
"How fortunate for you that the university's "chosen to hire you,

26
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,970
"尽管您25年来都没做出什么原创研究"
despite the fact "that you've done no original research in 25 years,

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,140
"而只是出版了一系列畅销书"
"and instead have written a series of popular books "

28
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,080
"将科学的伟大概念 降格为一系列奇闻轶事"
that reduce the great concepts of science "to a series of anecdotes,

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,610
"每则故事都简单到
"each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,260
能在一次肠部运动的时间内看完" (就是厕所读物)
of an average bowel movement.

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,950
Mahalo (夏威夷语的谢谢)
Mahalo.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,290
"Mahalo"是不错的修饰
"Mahalo's" a nice touch.

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,330
你知道夏威夷语里只有8个辅音吗?
You know there only eight consonants in the hawaiian language?

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,630
很好 你就这么做开场白吧
Interesting. You should lead with that.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,740
瞧瞧这自助餐
Oh,god,look at this buffet.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,410
我爱美国
I love america.

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,070
印度没自助餐吗?
You don't have buffets in india?

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,450
当然有 可那些都是印度菜
Of course,but it's all indian food.

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,140
在孟买你可能连救命的面包圈都找不到
You can't find a bagel in mumbai to save your life.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,060
给我涂点
Shmear me.

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,770
真是有趣
Well,here's an interesting turn of events.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,430
怎么了?
What?

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,150
霍华德带了女伴?
Howard brought a date?

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,860
最有可能性的解释是
A more plausible explanation is

45
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,100
他在机器人方面的研究 取得了重大进展
that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,890
怎样 科学怪人们?
Hey,what up,science bitches?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,220
这位是我特别的女性朋友桑茉
May I introduce my special lady friend summer?

48
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,010
霍华德 我说了碰我要加钱的
Howard,I told you touching's extra.

49
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,140
好 抱歉
Right. Sorry.

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,380
我们的新老板来了 礼貌点
Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

51
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,760
大家好
Hi,fellas.

52
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,800
- 我是艾瑞克·盖博豪斯 - 我是霍华德·沃罗威茨
- Eric gablehauser. - Howard wolowitz.

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,040
霍华德 见到你很高兴 你是?
Howard,nice to meet you. And you are?

54
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,880
一个真真正正的科学家
An actual real scientist.

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,870
这个开场白怎样?
How was that?

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,490
我不敢相信他开除我了
I can't believe he fired me.

57
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,330
你说他是被捧出来的高中理科老师
Well,you did call him a glorified high school science teacher

58
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,710
还说他上一次成功的试验 是点燃了自己的屁
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.

59
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,760
但我之前说了"恕我直言"
In my defense,I prefaced that by saying,"with all due respect."

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,090
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第04集
The.Luminous.Fish.Effect

61
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,340
早
Morning.

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,860
早
Morning.

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,000
今天早餐 你做鸡蛋吃?
You're making eggs for breakfast?

64
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,690
这不是早餐 这是试验
This isn't breakfast,it's an experiment.

65
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,900
但看起来很像早餐
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,680
我终于有时间验证我的理论 从蛋白质中分离水分子
I finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules

67
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,650
以及它对口感的影响
from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.

68
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,900
听起来真开胃
Sounds yummy.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,350
我很期待你配上熏肉后的成果
I look forward to your work with bacon.

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,290
我也是
As do I.

71
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,880
我相信只要你跟盖博豪斯道歉
You know,I'm sure if you just apologize to gablehauser,

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
他会让你回去工作的
he would give you your job back.

73
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,190
我不想回去工作
I don't want my job back.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,180
过去三年半时间我都在瞪着 写满方程式的板子上
I've spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations.

75
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,750
在那之前我花了四年时间写论文
Before that,I spent four years working on my thesis.

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,870
在那之前 我在上大学 而在大学之前 我在上5年级
Before that,I was in college,and before that,I was in the fifth grade.

77
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,740
这是我十几年来第一次休息 我要好好享受
This is my first d oayff in decades and I'm going to savor it.

78
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,740
好吧
Okay.

79
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,820
那你回去弄你的鸡蛋吧
I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.

80
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,470
不只是我的鸡蛋 弄的是全人类的蛋
Not just fixing my eggs,I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
我们都感激你
And we all thank you.

82
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,560
要用新鲜鸡蛋
use new eggs.

83
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,220
嗨 我正要去超市
hi. Hey,I'm running out to the market.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,640
你们要带什么吗?
Do you guys need anything?

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,180
这就是那些不熟悉数学规律的人
Oh,well,this would be one of those circumstances that

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,960
会称之为巧合的事件之一了
people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,990
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,970
我要蛋
I need eggs.

89
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,440
4打就够了
Four dozen should suffice.

90
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,200
4打?
Four dozen?

91
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,530
对 棕蛋 白蛋
Yes,and evenly distributed amongst brown,white,

92
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,820
走地鸡蛋 大鸡蛋 加大鸡蛋 跟特大鸡蛋各要8个
free-range,large,extra large and jumbo.

93
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,200
好 再说一次
Okay,one more time.

94
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,530
算了 你肯定搞不对
Never mind. You won't get it right.

95
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,690
我最好跟你一起去
I'd better come with you.

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
好呀
Oh,yay.

97
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,100
你今天怎么没去上班?
How come you didn't go into work today?

98
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,980
我在休假 因为我不愿向平庸之流屈服
I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,100
你给开除了?
So you got canned,huh?

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,610
理论上说物理学家不会给开除...
Theoretical physicists do not get canned...

101
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,490
但你说对了
but yeah.

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
可能这样最好
Well,maybe it's all for the best.

103
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,090
我相信一扇门关上了  总会有另外一扇门打开的
You know,I always say when one door closes,another one opens.

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,930
不 不是的
No,it doesn'T.

105
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,960
除非两扇门用继电器连接
Not unless the two doors are connected by relays

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,700
而且还装有传感器
or there are motion sensors involved.

107
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,300
不 我是说...
No,no,I meant...

108
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,490
或者一扇门关上时产生的空气
or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure

109
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,680
压力作用于第二扇门引致...
that acts upon the second door.

110
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,290
算了
Never mind.

111
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,260
慢点
Slow down.

112
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,200
慢点! 拜托慢点!
Slow down. Please,slow down!

113
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,160
没事啦!
We're fine!

114
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,810
你跟车都不保持足够的距离
You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.

115
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,790
我有啊!
Oh,sure,I am.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,630
不 我给你算算
No,no,let me do the math for you.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,130
就算这车重4000磅
This car weighs,let's say 4,000 pounds.

118
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,530
我140磅 你120磅
Now add 140 for me,120 for you...

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,460
- 120? - 不好意思
- 120? - Oh,I'm sorry.

120
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,650
冒犯你了吗?
Did I insult you?

121
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,710
你的体重跟自我价值有关系?
Is your body mass somehow tied into your self-worth?

122
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,990
当然
Well,yeah.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,250
有趣
Interesting.

124
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,800
那么我们就算总重4400磅吧
Anyway,that gives us a total weight of,let's say 4,400 pounds.

125
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,990
算4390磅
Let's say 4,390.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,470
好
Fine.

127
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,430
目前时速是 老天啊 51英里/时
We're traveling forward at-- good lord-- 51 miles an hour.

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,780
假设你的刹车是新的 卡钳也是校准的
Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the calipers are aligned.

129
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,520
当我们踩下刹车时
Still,by the time we come to a stop,

130
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,110
我们就会和前面的别克汽车撞在一起
we'll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us,

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,050
因此我们会在短时间内 给压成稀泥 死得很惨...
an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death,mutilation...

132
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,340
哇 看 他们在铺新的迷你高尔夫场地
oh,look,they built a new putt-putt course.

133
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,960
真不错
This is great.

134
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,110
看看我
Look at me.

135
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,480
我生活在普通人的平凡世界中
I'm in the real world of ordinary people

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,120
过着他们无趣平常的一天
just living their ordinary,colorless workaday lives.

137
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,700
谢谢
Thank you.

138
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,650
不 谢谢你
No,thank you.

139
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,270
还有谢谢你 普通人
And thank you,ordinary person.

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,370
你想知道关于番茄的趣闻吗?
Hey,you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?

141
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,750
不 不是很想
Uh,no,no,not really.

142
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,830
你不是要买鸡蛋的吗?
Listen,didn't you say you needed some eggs?

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,210
对 但任何对细菌繁殖学稍有了解的人
Yes,but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth

144
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,610
都会在出去结账时 才买冰柜里的食物
knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.

145
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,120
那好 那你现在就该准备出去了
Oh,okay,well,then maybe you should start heading on out then.

146
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,630
不 这样很好玩啊
No,this is fun.

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,230
关于番茄的事 我觉得你肯定会喜欢的
Oh,the thing about tomatoes-- and I think you'll really enjoy this--

148
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,130
它们给摆在蔬菜栏里 但事实上却是一种水果
is they're shelved with the vegetables,but they're technically a fruit.

149
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,680
- 真有意思 - 是吧?
- Oh,interesting. - Isn't it?

150
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,520
不 我指的是你觉得有趣的事情很有趣
No,I mean what you find enjoyable.

151
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,210
天啊
Oh,boy.

152
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,310
又怎么了?
What now?

153
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,750
服用维生素剂虽然有一定好处
Well,there's some value to taking a multivitamin,

154
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,180
但人体能吸收的量是有限的
but the human body can only absorb so much.

155
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,220
你买这么多 就是买的一堆昂贵的尿液原料
What you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

156
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,050
也许那就是我的目的呢
Well,maybe that's what I was going for.

157
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,170
那你可以买锰
Well,then you'll want some manganese.

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,170
刚刚很好玩呀
Well,that was fun.

159
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,900
也许明天我们能 一起去那种仓储式商店
Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.

160
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,060
我不知道哦 谢尔顿
Oh,I don't know,sheldon.

161
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,890
我要花一段时间才能 从今天度过的乐趣中恢复过来
It's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.

162
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,810
你确定?
Are you sure?

163
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,300
大宗采购有很多优势呀
There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk.

164
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,430
比如说 我发现你的卫生巾一次是购买一个月的量
For example,I noticed that you purchase your tampons one-month supply at a time.

165
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,540
什么?
What?

166
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,200
想想啊
Think about it.

167
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,960
这种东西放着也不会变坏
It's a product that doesn't spoil

168
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,890
而且你接下来至少30年都要用它
and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,260
你要我一次性买30年份的?
You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?

170
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,340
30或35年 你母亲什么时候绝经的?
Well,30,35. When did your mother go into menopause?

171
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,160
好了
Okay.

172
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,930
我才不跟你说这个
I'm not talking about this with you.

173
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,600
这是很自然的人类进程
Oh,penny,this is a natural human process

174
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,020
而且我们讨论怎么省钱的问题
and we're talking about statistically significant savings.

175
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,070
现在假设你每次用15条 28天一周期...
Now,if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

176
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,650
你经期正常吗?
are you fairly regular?

177
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,720
好吧 不去仓储式商店 但我们还是一起去高尔夫 对吧
Okay,no warehouse store,but we're still on for putt-putt golf,right?

178
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,550
我刚碰到佩里
Hey,I just ran into penny.

179
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,620
她好像有点心烦
She seemed upset about something.

180
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,050
可能她大姨妈来了吧
I think it's her time of the month.

181
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,100
我在日历上做记录 以备参考
I marked the calendar for future reference.

182
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,210
鱼是怎么回事?
What's with the fish?

183
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,220
是实验呀
It's an experiment.

184
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,310
你的炒蛋研究呢?
What happened to your scrambled egg research?

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,660
那是死路一条
Oh,that was a dead end.

186
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,810
炒蛋怎么弄也就这样啦
Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.

187
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,980
那...现在研究鱼?
So... fish?

188
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,030
我看到一篇文章 说日本科学家
I read an article about japanese scientists

189
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,770
将发光水母的DNA注入到其他动物体内
who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals

190
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,210
我就想 "哦 夜光鱼"
and I thought,"hey,fish nightlights.

191
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,300
夜光鱼?
Fish nightlights?

192
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,920
这是个能发大财的主意
It's a billion-dollar idea.

193
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,200
我不会出去
Mum's the word.

194
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
谢尔顿 你确定不要跟
Sheldon,are you sure you don't want to

195
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,350
系主任道歉 然后回去上班啊?
just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back?

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,490
不不不 我有太多事情要做
Oh,no,no,no,I have too much to do.

197
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,500
比如说发光鱼
Like luminous fish.

198
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,860
对不起 我不知道
I'm sorry. I didn'T...

199
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,220
这只是个开头
that's just the beginning.

200
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,510
我还有个大宗女性护理用品 邮购公司的设想
I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company.

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,010
夜光卫生棉条!
Oh,glow-in-the-dark tampons!

202
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,670
莱纳德 我们会暴富
Leonard,we're gonna be rich.

203
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,990
谢谢你这么快赶过来
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
你给我打电话是对的
Well,you did the right thing calling.

205
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,440
我不知道还能怎么办
I didn't know what else to do.

206
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,750
他失去生活的重心了
He's lost all focus.

207
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,200
每天他都沉迷于一个新想法
Every day he's got a new obsession.

208
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,990
这一个让我特别困扰
This is a particularly disturbing one.

209
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,970
妈妈?
Mommy?

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,840
宝贝!
Hi,baby!

211
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,340
</i>你给我妈打电话了?!<i>

212
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,510
你给自己弄了个纺织机? 真棒!
Oh,you got yourself a loom? How nice!

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,650
谢谢
Thank you.

214
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,070
亲爱的 为什么要弄台纺织机?
Honey,why'd you get a loom?

215
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,050
我在研究发光鱼 所以我想到...
I was working with luminous fish,and I thought,hey...

216
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,280
"纺织机" (英语中"纺织机"与"发光"发音部分相同)
"loom."

217
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,080
你来这干嘛 妈妈?
Mom,what are you doing here?

218
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,750
莱纳德给我打电话了
Leonard called me.

219
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,630
我知道 为什么?
I know,but why?

220
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,890
因为21世纪最聪明的脑袋
Because one of the great minds of the 21st century

221
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,390
用在了养夜光鱼 和编织毛毯上
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.

222
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
这不是披肩 这是披风
This is not a serape,this is a poncho.

223
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,250
披肩两边不收边 披风是一体的
A serape is open at the sides; a poncho is closed.

224
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,180
所以这是披风
This is a poncho.

225
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,060
不管是什么 都不能成为 你打电话给别人母亲的理由
And neither is a reason to call someone's mother.

226
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,990
是吗? 你上一次出门是什么时候?
Really? When was the last time you left the house?

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,690
跟佩里去超市
I went to the market with penny.

228
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,570
对 那是三周以前的事了
Yeah,that was three weeks ago.

229
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,110
那么小心啦 接下来的4到8天她会变得很暴躁
Well,then buckle up-- in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.

230
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,420
亲爱的 你的朋友很担心你
Sweetheart,your little friend is concerned about you.

231
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,130
但我是成年人了 我能过自己想要的生活
Yes,well,I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man,capable of living my life as I see fit.

232
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,060
我也绝不需要 有打小报告人给我的妈妈!
And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!

233
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,020
等等 你去哪?
Wait,where are you going?

234
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,910
我房间! 所有人都不许进来!
To my room-- and no one's allowed in!

235
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,540
他的脾气像他爸爸
oh,he gets his temper from his daddy.

236
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,260
- 眼睛像我 - 原来如此
- He's got my eyes. - I see.

237
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,770
他的科学头脑是上帝赐予的
All that science stuff,that comes from jesus.

238
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,620
谢尔顿 你妈妈做了晚饭
Sheldon,your mom made dinner.

239
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,390
我不饿!
I'm not hungry!

240
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,730
莱纳德 你别管了 他很固执的
Oh,leonard,don't trouble yourself. He's stubborn.

241
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,180
他会一直待到他满意为止
He may stay in there till the rapture.

242
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,920
确定那是件坏事?
We so sure that's a bad thing?

243
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,770
跟你说 我很爱那孩子 但他很难相处
I tell you,I love the boy to death,but he has been difficult

244
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,340
自从他在Kmart超市 从我身体里滑出来后
since he fell out of me at the k-mart.

245
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,310
原谅我的无礼 但我终于知道谢尔顿 英俊的外表是从哪继承的了
Excuse me for being so bold,but I now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.

246
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,850
亲爱的 这不会起作用的 但你可以继续尝试
Honey,that ain't gonna work,but you keep tryin'.

247
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,250
我做了鸡肉
I made chicken.

248
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,360
我希望你们那里 不会把他当做神圣的动物
I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic.

249
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,100
我们教堂里有一个印度人
You know,we have an indian gentleman at our church,

250
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,650
派特医生 这是个感人的故事
a dr.Patel-- it's a beautiful story.

251
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,240
上帝给与他启示 把他带来我们身边 让我们享受8折手术
The lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasik--

252
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,690
你知道 给那些需要做这手术的人
you know,those that needed it.

253
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,190
真是个感人的故事
That is a lovely story.

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,500
谢尔顿的事 我们不用做什么吗?
Um,are we gonna do anything about sheldon?

255
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,360
当然要
Oh,we will.

256
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,460
对付谢尔顿要慢慢来
You have to take your time with sheldon.

257
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,600
他死去的爸爸过去总跟我说
His father,god rest his soul,used to always say to me,

258
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,830
"玛丽 对谢尔顿要耐心"
"mary,you have to take your time with sheldon."

259
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,150
听起来是个睿智的人啊
Sounds like a wise man.

260
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,720
没那么睿智
Oh,not so wise.

261
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,030
他有一次为了甘草跟山猫打了一架
He once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice.

262
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,000
大家拿盘子 还有谢尔顿织的餐垫
So,everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that shelly wove.

263
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,550
他以前也这么发作过吗?
Has shelly ever freaked out like this before?

264
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,140
总是这样
Oh,all the time.

265
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,500
我记得他13岁时的夏天
I remember one summer when he was 13,

266
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,840
他在小屋里做了一个小型原子反应堆
he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed

267
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,060
然后跟大家说 他会为全镇人提供免费电力
and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town.

268
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,000
问题是 他没有你们所说的"可裂变物质"
Well,the only problem was,he had no what you call "fissionable" materials.

269
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,420
当他试图上网采购时
Anyway,when he went on the internets to get some,

270
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,090
一个政府官员来访 很温柔地让他坐下
a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle,

271
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,590
告诉他 私人持有铀精矿是违法的
and told him it's against the law to have yellow-cake uranium in a shed.

272
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,970
然后呢?
Well,what happened?

273
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,510
发作了呀
Well,poor boy had a fit.

274
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,700
把自己锁在屋里 做了个音速死亡放射线仪
Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.

275
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,670
死亡放射线?
A death ray?

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,150
他是这么叫的
Well,that's what he called it.

277
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,640
那玩意都阻止不了隔壁的小孩
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,020
倒是让家里的狗折腾个没完
It pissed our dog off to no end.

279
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,760
知道吗 你俩真是可爱的一对
You know,you two make a cute couple.

280
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,860
不 我们不是...
uh,no. We're not...

281
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,350
不是一对 我们都是单身
we're not-not a couple. We're singles.

282
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,170
- 两个单身 - 对
- Two singles. - Yeah.

283
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,240
像是那种...独立包装的芝士片
Like those... individually wrapped slices of cheese that...

284
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,510
我们是朋友
we're friends.

285
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,820
我是不是踩到地雷了?
Did I pluck a nerve there?

286
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,360
- 对 - 好吧
- Oh,yeah. - Okay.

287
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,750
好吧 大家 该吃饭了
All right,everybody,it's time to eat.

288
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,520
主啊 感谢您赐予我们晚餐 及您所有的恩赐
Oh,lord,we thank you for this meal and all of your bounty.

289
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,290
我们祈求您帮助谢尔顿重新振作
And we pray that you help sheldon get back on his rocker.

290
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,730
沉思一阵之后 我会以"以主之名"结束
Now,after a moment of silent meditation,I'm gonna end with "in jesus' name,"

291
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,020
但你们俩不一定要跟着一起说
but you two don't feel any obligation to join in.

292
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,930
当然 除非你被圣灵感动
Unless,of course,the holy spirit moves you.

293
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,990
哇 这是我吃过最好吃的厚皮馅饼
Oh,my god,this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,740
谢尔顿最喜欢吃这个
It was always sheldon's favorite.

295
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,120
你知道秘方是什么吗?
You know w thathe secret ingredient is?

296
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,350
- 爱? - 猪油
- Love? - Lard.

297
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,980
看看谁来了...
Hey,look who's come...

298
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,360
嘘 你会吓到他的
You'll spook him.

299
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,100
他就跟小鹿似的 你得让他过来亲近你
He's like a baby deer-- you got to let him come to you.

300
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,720
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

301
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,910
够了! 谢尔顿 振作起来!
Damn it,sheldon,snap out of it!

302
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,380
你是物理学家
You're a physicist--

303
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,530
该在学校做实验 而不是躲房间里
you belong at the university doing research,not hiding in your room!

304
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,660
你不打猎的 是不是?
you don't hunt,do you?

305
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,550
早上好 小饼干
good morning,snickerdoodle.

306
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,560
早
Morning.

307
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,880
那看起来好奇特啊 是什么呢?
Oh,well,that looks awful fancy. What is that?

308
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,570
我设想的硅系生物DNA模型
It's my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon-based life-form.

309
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,740
但是由造物主巧妙地设计?
But intelligently designed by a creator,right?

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,670
你想干什么呀 妈妈?
What do you want,mom?

311
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,000
你知道你爸爸经常说
You know how your daddy used to say that

312
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,090
你只能在把炸药扔进鱼塘之前
you can only fish for so long

313
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,630
钓那么一会儿鱼
before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?

314
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,730
记得
Yeah.

315
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,170
我钓够鱼了
Well,I'm done fishing.

316
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,980
你穿上衣服
You put those on.

317
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,770
为什么?
What for?

318
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,860
因为你要回到办公室
Because you're gonna go down to your office,

319
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,710
跟你的老板道歉 回去上班
you're gonna apologize to your boss and get your job back.

320
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,570
不要
No.

321
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,110
不好意思 我刚刚是以 "若尊贵的陛下愿意"开始的吗?
I'm sorry,did I start that sentence with the words,"if it please your highness"?

322
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,870
我不要道歉 我说的都是实话
I'm not going to apologize-- I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

323
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,370
你听好
Now,you listen here.

324
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,120
我从你4岁开始就跟你说
I have been telling you since you were four years old,

325
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,110
比大家都聪明不是问题 但你不能到处显摆
it's okay to be smarter than everybody,but you can't go around pointing it out.

326
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,860
为什么?
Why not?

327
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,400
因为别人不喜欢!
Because people don't like it!

328
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,040
记得邻居的孩子欺负你的事吗?
Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids?

329
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,950
动作快点
now,let's get crackin'.

330
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,200
沐浴更衣 然后我们就出发
Shower,shirt,shoes,and let's shove off.

331
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,390
如果那该死的死亡放射线能用 我就不会挨打了
There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
问题解决了
Problem solved.

333
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,400
真的?
Really?

334
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,720
真厉害
That's impressive.

335
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,150
莱纳德 主自有分寸
Leonard,the lord never gives us more than we can handle.

336
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
幸亏我另外两个孩子傻得像头驴
Thankfully,he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.

337
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,970
抱歉 盖博豪斯博士 您在忙吗?
Excuse me,dr.Gablehauser,are you busy?

338
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,590
实际上...
Well,actually...

339
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,020
谢尔顿 他只是在乱画而已
sheldon,he's just doodlin'.

340
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,490
进来
Get in here.

341
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,850

343
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,110
说吧宝贝 天要黑了
Let's go,baby-- we're losing daylight.

344
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,650
你知道 几周前我们第一次见面时
as you know,several weeks ago in our first encounter,

345
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,110
我们可能没给彼此留下好印象 我称你为白痴
we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I called you an idiot.

346
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,460
我只想跟你道歉...
And I just wanted to say that I was wrong...

347
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,010
指出这一点是我不对
to point it out.

348
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,520
抱歉 我们还不认识
I'm sorry,we haven't been introduced.

349
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,720
艾瑞克·盖博豪斯博士
Dr.Eric gablehauser.

350
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,700
我叫玛丽·库珀 是谢尔顿的妈妈
Mary cooper,sheldon's mom.

351
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,190
不可能吧
Now,that's impossible--

352
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,220
你怀他的时候还是个少女吧
you must have had him when you were a teenager.

353
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,470
你嘴真甜
Oh,aren't you sweet.

354
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,730
他父亲过世了
His father's dead.

355
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,520
- 最近? - 够久的了
- Recently? - Long enough.

356
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,560
请坐
Please.

357
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,980
谢尔顿 你不该去上班啊?
sheldon,shouldn't you be working?

358
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,940
好的
Okay.

359
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,130
怎么样?
Hey,how did it go?

360
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,670
我可以回来上班了
I got my job back.

361
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,750
真的? 怎么回事?
Really? What happened?

362
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,040
我不太清楚
I'm not quite sure.

363
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,700
其中包含的人类经验我从未经历过
It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.

364
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,930
那还真是缩小范围了
Well,that narrows it down.

365
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,920
我为你骄傲 宝贝
I'm very proud of you,honey.

366
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,680
你今天表现出了极大的勇气

谢谢你 妈妈
Thanks,mom.

368
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,130
妈?
Mom?

369
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,740
盖博豪斯博士会是我的新爸爸吗?
Is dr.Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?

370
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,080
看看再说吧
We'll see.

371
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,180
好梦
Sleep tight.
