1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,750
另一方面呢  物理学家又开始担心
On the other hand, some physicists are concerned

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,700
一旦超撞机真的实现
That if this supercollider actually works,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,800
它产生的黑洞会吞噬地球
It'll create a black hole and swallow up the earth,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,420
终结生命
Ending life as we know it.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,560
真是一群爱哭鬼
Pfft, what a bunch of crybabies.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,450
人有多大胆  地有多大产
No guts, no glory, man.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,300
嘿  看看这个
Hey, check it out.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,540
药学院要招志愿者
The school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,410
"我们正在测试一种新药  专治社交焦虑症
"we are testing a new medication "for social anxiety, panic attacks,

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,250
恐慌发作症  陌生环境恐怖症和强迫症"
Agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder."

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,940
他们为什么要在这招人?
Why would they be looking for test subjects here?

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,720
我怎么知道  拉杰
I don't know, raj.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,570
没准是因为漫画书店没有布告栏
Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,000
在这干什么呢?
What's going on?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,190
嘘  嘘  谢尔顿办公室有个靓妹
Shh, shh, hot girl in sheldon's office.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,250
在谢尔顿的办公室?
Sheldon's office?

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,380
她是不是走丢了?
Is she lost?

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,710
我认为不是
I don't think so.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,610
我从停车场就开始跟着她了
I followed her here from the parking lot.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,430
可能她是他的律师
Maybe she's his lawyer.

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,920
那她可以随时查看我的诉讼
Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,630
-霍华德  -我知道  我很恶心
Howard. I know, I'm disgusting.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,530
我应该被惩罚...被她惩罚
I should be punished... by her.

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,150
看  我还是这么恶心
Oh, look, I did it again.

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,210
那样就差不多了
That should do it.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,010
麻烦你跑一趟
Thank you for coming by.

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,570
你们好啊
Hello.

28
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,610
嘿  老弟...
Oh, hey, buddy...

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,220
"老弟..."?
"buddy..."?

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,130
不好意思  我来迟了
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,980
我正在攻关一个项目  可能要上一次航天飞机了
I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.

32
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,030
为什么要说晚了呢?
How can you be late?

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,690
我根本没想要你来
I wasn't expecting you at all.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,120
我总是神出鬼没
Nobody ever expects me.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,480
有时你只是看着看着就...
Sometimes you just look and...

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,730
霍华德·沃尔维茨驾到
Bam! howard wolowitz.

37
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,560
谢尔顿  能介绍一下吗?
Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,820
可以  这是米茜
Oh, all right. uh, this is missy.

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,690
米茜  这是莱纳德和拉杰  你已经见过霍华德了
Missy, this is leonard and rajesh, and you've already met howard.

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,710
很高兴见到你们
It's nice to meet you.

41
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,140
你也是  也  也是
You, too, as well, also.

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,300
是
Yeah.

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,400
你们两个是怎么认识的?
So, how do you two know each other?

44
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,050
他的头可在我的胯下呆过9个月
Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.

45
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,120
啊?
Excuse me?

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,320
她是我的孪生妹妹
She's my twin sister.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,590
她以为自己很风趣  但说实话  我从来看不出
She thinks she's funny, but frankly, I've never been able to see it.

48
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,660
这是因为你根本无法衡量什么是幽默  谢利(昵称)
That's because you have no measurable sense of humor, shelly.

49
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,270
一个人要怎么衡量幽默?
How exactly would one measure a sense of humor?

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,390
幽默测量器?
A humormometer?

51
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,320
我觉得你非常得幽默
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,320
-当然  就像法语中  "你真有趣"  -看我记不记得住
Ooor, as the french say, tres drole. okay, so let me see if I got this.

53
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,230
莱纳德  霍华德  还有...
Leonard, howard and...

54
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,940
不好意思  你叫?
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,260
拉杰
Rajesh.

56
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,000
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第15集
The.Shiksa.Indeterminacy

57
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,980
那么  米茜  你为什么从德州跑到这来?
So, missy, what brings you all the way from texas?

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,300
是不是缘分?  我觉得是缘分
Was it perhaps destiny? I think it was destiny.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,040
我朋友明晚在迪斯尼结婚
My friend's s getting married at disneyland tomorrow night.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,120
destiny "缘分、命运"也作"目的地"解 阿纳海姆是迪斯尼乐园的所在地
缘分  名字就叫做阿纳海姆市(美国南加州)
Destiny, thy name is anaheim.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,260
我还过来让谢利在父亲的地产文书上签个字
And I had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,820
文书可以邮寄的吧
The papers could've been mailed.

63
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,260
妈让你来监视我  没错吧
Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,500
我想这就是为什么他们要管你叫天才了
I guess that's why they call you a genius.

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,070
他们叫我天才是因为我确实是天才
They call me a genius because I'm a genius.

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,600
告诉妈我目前165磅
Tell mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,260
还有我的胃肠蠕动正常
And that I'm having regular bowel movements.

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,180
好好享受婚礼  拜拜
Enjoy the wedding. good-bye.

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,300
婚礼不是明天吗  不如你今晚来我们这吧?
If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,860
我看行不通
Oh, I don't think so.

71
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,520
谢利不喜欢别人缠着他
Shelly doesn't like company.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,450
即使是在他小时候
Even as a little boy,

73
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,310
他也会在晚上把假想的朋友送回家
He'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.

74
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,100
他们不是朋友
They were not friends.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,140
他们是假想的同事
They were imaginary colleagues.

76
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,990
你看  你都来了
Look, you're here.

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,350
我们有很多房间的
We have plenty of room.

78
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,260
不  我们没有
No, we don't.

79
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,290
别这样  谢利  她是家人啊
Come on, shelly. she's family.

80
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,210
那又怎么样  我都没有邀请你妈来
So what, I don't issue invitations to your mother.

81
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,090
能不用在高峰时段开去阿纳海姆也不错啊
Well, it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour.

82
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,870
再也不要叫我谢利
And don't ever call me shelly.

83
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,650
就这么定了  你住我们这儿
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

84
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,730
我带你去拿车
Yeah, I'll walk you to your car.

85
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,840
你车停在3区  c层  没错吧
You're in structure 3, level c, right?

86
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,660
这都是怎么一回事?
What just happened?

87
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,400
反正
So anyway,

88
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,930
我们8岁时  谢尔顿把我的
We're eight years old and sheldon converts my

89
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,610
傻瓜式烤箱改装成了一种高能量熔炉
Easy bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,590
太经典了
Just classic.

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,280
我要做家用集成电路
I needed a place to fire ceramic

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,290
需要一个可以融化半导体陶瓷基底的地方
Semiconductor substrates for homemade integrated circuits.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,450
他当时想要造一个
He was trying to build some sort of

94
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,340
武装机器人来把我赶出他的房间
Armed robot to keep me out of his room.

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,850
要不是你一直闯进我的房间这也没必要
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.

96
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,790
还有  我去做了些小的玉米蛋糕
Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you.

97
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,800
突然哗的一下
There's a big flash.

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,250
你醒来的时候眉毛就不见了
Next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.

99
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,790
你的眉毛?
Not your eyebrows.

100
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,650
是
Yep,

101
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,670
然后我整个二年级都要
I had to go through the entire second

102
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,080
顶着妈妈画的弯曲的假眉毛去上学
Grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,230
是这样吗?
Is that what that was?

104
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,940
我还以为是二年级的课程
I just assumed that the second grade

105
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,810
让你行为变得有些古怪
Curriculum had rendered you quizzical.

106
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,240
莱纳德  你短裤忘在楼下的干衣机里了
Hey, leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.

107
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,970
那不是我的
Those are not mine.

108
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,200
真的吗
Really?

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
这里面有你名字的小标签啊
They have your little name label in them.

110
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,590
对...不  我...
Yeah... no, I do... i...

111
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,640
我是用这来磨光我捕鱼用的鱼叉器材的
I use those, uh, just to polish up my spearfishing equipment.

112
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,540
我用鱼叉捕鱼的
I spearfish.

113
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,410
我不去用石弓打猎时  我会去用鱼叉捕鱼
When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spearfish.

114
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,100
佩妮  这是谢尔顿的孪生妹妹  米茜
Uh, penny, this is sheldon's twin sister, missy.

115
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,550

Missy, this is our neighbor penny. don't look that much alike.

116
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,310
让我说声哈利路亚(赞美上帝)
Can I get a hallelujah?

117
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,970
异卵双生的双胞胎来自于两个不同的卵子中
Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs.

118
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,030
他们不像一般的同胞手足那样
They are no more alike than any other siblings.

119
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,570
哈利路亚!

120
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,650

Yes, I'm very hopeful. hello, missy.

125
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,660
他们提到过可能会有副作用
They mentioned there may be side effects.

126
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,750
米茜  你遇到过来自充满异域风情的印度次大陆的男人吗
So, missy, have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india?

127
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,930

你喜欢摩托车吗
Do you like motorcycles?

130
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,210
我有一台哈雷摩托(俚语指小弟弟)
'cause I ride a hog.

131
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,930
哈雷?
A hog?

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,800
你那辆是两轮的踏板车  前面还装个小篮子的
You have a two-cylinder scooter with a basket in the front.

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,690

你听说过伽摩经吗
Have you ever heard of the kama sutra?

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,110
讲性爱的书
The sex book.

136
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,880
是印度的性爱之书
The indian sex book.

137
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,830
换句话说  如果你好奇是谁写了这本关于爱的书
In other words, if you "wonder, wonder who wrote the book of love,

138
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,750
是我们印度人
" it was us.

139
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,180
谢尔顿的妹妹挺漂亮啊  是吧
So, sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?

140
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,680
我没有盯着她看
I wasn't staring.

141
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,210
我没有说你在盯着她啊  我只是说她挺漂亮
I didn't say you were. I just said she was cute.

142
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,850
可能吧  如果你喜欢这么高...
Oh, eh... maybe, if you like women who are tall...

143
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,850
而且完美的
And perfect.

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,870
谢尔顿  你怎么不理你妹妹啊
Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?

145
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,260
我没有不理我妹妹  我是不理你们任何人
I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.

146
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,580
这里有些小吃
I brought snacks!

147
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
哈  腌黄瓜和..
Oh, my, gherkins and...

148
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,520
洋葱酱  这个是洋葱酱
Onion dip. it's onion dip.

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
我们不常招待人的
We don't entertain much.

150
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,200
米茜
Missy.

151
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,710
你喜欢穿睡衣吗
Do you enjoy pajamas?

152
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,390
应该是吧
I guess.

153
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,190
太好了  是我们印度人发明的睡衣
Yeah, we indians invented them.

154
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,490
不客气
You're welcome.

155
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,810
那这么说  是我们犹太人发明了割礼
Yeah, well, my people invented circumcision.

156
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,280
不客气
You're welcome.

157
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,900
米茜  我要去做指甲
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.

158
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,780
想一起去吗
Do you want to come?

159
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,220
太好了  我去  谢谢你
God, yes. thanks.

160
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,450
不客气
You're welcome.

161
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,350
-大伙再见  -再见  米茜
Bye, guys. bye, missy.

162
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,580
-米茜  再见  -再见  莱纳德
Bye, missy, see you. good-bye, leonard.

163
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,630
对...不...再见  佩妮
Oh, yeah, no, uh, bye, penny.

164
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,080
听着  你们俩给我闪开
Okay, you two have to back off.

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,600
我干吗要闪开  你闪开  伙计
Why should I back off? you back off, dude.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,670
不好意思  这是我的房子  她是我室友的妹妹
Excuse me, this is my apartment, and she's my roommate's sister.

167
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,180
那又怎么样  你已经有佩妮了
So what? you've already got penny!

168
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,480
我怎么有佩妮了?
How do I have penny?

169
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,870
我到底哪门子有佩妮了?
In what universe do I have penny?

170
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,560
那我可以追她了?
So I can have penny?

171
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,280
该死  不行!
Hell, no!

172
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,700
抱歉  我能插两句吗
Excuse me. can I interject something?

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,750
我正在线订一个披萨
I'm ordering pizza online.

174
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,610
意大利辣香肠你们都吃吧?
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

175
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,350
谢尔顿  我能跟你单独谈一下吗
Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?

176
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,720
行啊
I guess.

177
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,570
别担心  我会点那种芝士少一点的
Don't worry. I was going to order you cheese-less.

178
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,800
-谢谢你  -没事
Thank you. it's okay.

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,470
不能吃乳糖不是什么丢脸的事
Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.

180
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,140
我是梦幻印度情人
I'm a fancy indian man.

181
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,620
我们发明了睡衣
We invented pajamas.

182
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,890
看我  我没有包皮
Hey, look at me. I don't have a foreskin.

183
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,640
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

184
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,860
你难道没意识到你妹妹魅不可挡吗
Are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?

185
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,070
她确实有着西方文化所青睐的
She certainly has the symmetry and low

186
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,340
既匀称而又低脂肪的身段
Body fat that western culture deems desirable.

187
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,050
这倒是值得注意的  在历史上
It's noteworthy, at other points in history,

188
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,940
胖一些的女人象征着美丽
Heavier women were the standard for

189
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,540
因为她们的腰身意味着富饶
Beauty because their girth suggested affluence.

190
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,820
很令人着迷  但...
That's fascinating, but...

191
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,160
我没有说令人着迷  我只是说值得注意
I didn't say it was fascinating. I said it was noteworthy.

192
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,410
好吧  我注意到了
All right... noted.

193
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,530
我的意思是  库萨帕里和沃尔维茨
But my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz,

194
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,980
他们在泡你的妹妹啊
They're hitting on your sister.

195
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,460
这简直...
Oh, it's...

196
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,940
没事啊
Oh, okay.

197
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,670
我不想评价你说话的修辞手法
You know, I don't want to criticize your rhetorical style,

198
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,490
但要是你能开门见山地说
But we'd be a lot further along in this

199
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,680
我们可能已经谈得很深了
Conversation if you'd begun with that thought.

200
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,040
-很好  -但是...
That's great, but my...

201
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,250
我要说的是  我们拐了个不必要的弯
What I'm saying is that we took quite an Unnecessary detour

202
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,920
因为现在我发现这才是你的论点
from what I now understand to be your thesis.

203
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,050
又怎么了
Whatever.

204
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,670
你不能干坐着啊
You have to do something about it.

205
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,760
为什么
Why?

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
因为她是你妹妹
Because she's your sister.

207
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,910
我不明白
I don't understand.

208
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,470
不错  我们共同在一个子宫里待过九个月
Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months,

209
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,710
但此后我们就你走阳关道我走独木桥了
But since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.

210
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,010
好吧  那这么想吧...
Okay, uh, consider this...

211
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,510
你父亲去世之后
With your father gone,

212
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,960
确保米茜能选择一位合适的伴侣就是你的责任了
It is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate.

213
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,310
我倒没想过这个
I hadn't considered that.

214
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,140
我们确实有相同的DNA
We do share dna. uh-huh.

215
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,600
所以有这种可能  尽管可能性不大
So there is the possibility, however remote,

216
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,060
她的天赋可以创造另一个
That resting in her loins is the potential

217
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,870
像我这样不平凡的人
For another individual as remarkable as myself.

218
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,520
正是
Exactly.

219
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,050
并且你有责任替你自己和你子孙保留
And you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect

220
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,730
你妹妹所传后代遗传基因的完整性
The genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.

221
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,470
你说的对
You're right.

222
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,760
如果有人想接近米茜的输卵管
If someone wants to get at missy's fallopian tubes,

223
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,240
他们必须通过我
They'll have to go through me.

224
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,230
我是毁灭之神湿婆(印度三大神中司破坏之神)
I am shiva the destroyer!

225
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,080
我会赢得这个女人
I will have the woman.

226
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,090
警告你  我可是数学夏令营的柔道冠军
I'm warning you I was judo champion at math camp.

227
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,610
好了  你们幼稚够了吧
All right, now that's enough juvenile squabbling.

228
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,550
给我停下
You stop it.

229
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,310
我说给我停下!
Stop it, I say!

230
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,870
我现在就来处理这件事
I'm going to settle this right now.

231
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,040
你们中的任何一个都配不上我妹妹
Neither of you are good enough for my sister.

232
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,580
你是谁  凭什么你决定?
Who are you to decide that?

233
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,260
他是这个家的男人
He's the man of his family.

234
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,730
你们必须尊重他的意愿
You have to respect his wishes.

235
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,940
-顺便说一句  你也出局了  -你说什么?
You're out, too, by the way. say what?

236
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,290
我不是针对你
It's nothing personal.

237
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,300
我只是更希望我将来的侄子或者侄女
I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew

238
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,010
不要成为每次一吃冰激淋就觉得胀气的人
Didn't become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie.

239
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,750
你高兴个什么劲儿
What are you so happy about?

240
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,930
我不是高兴
I'm not happy.

241
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,320
药起作用了  我停不下来
It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

242
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,240
莱纳德让我意识到遗传基因的赌注有多大
That leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are,

243
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,940
我们必须面对现实
We have to face the fact that none

244
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,000
你们没有一个配得上我妹妹
Of you are suitable mates for my sister.

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,840
等一下
Wait a minute.

246
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,010
是莱纳德让你意识到的?
Leonard made you aware of that?

247
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,320
我们都会犯错  换个话题吧
We all make mistakes. let's move on.

248
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,050
插一句  不过我认为你错失了一个良机
Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.

249
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,940
怎么说
How so?

250
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,520
每个人都知道基因多样化能创造出了不起的后代
Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring.

251
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,860
"摩卡"产于阿拉伯 "拿铁"谐音拉丁
不如考虑在拿铁家族里 放点摩卡调和一下
Why not put a little mocha in the family latte?

252
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,460
理论上  你说的没错
In principle, you have a point.

253
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,730
但考虑到实际情况
But as a practical matter,

254
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,020
允许我提醒你一下  你都需要实验性药品
Need I remind you that it takes experimental

255
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,500
才能让你更容易开口跟异性说话
Pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.

256
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,180
我觉得你把太多的焦点放在药物上了
I think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs.

257
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,750
是不是因为我是个犹太人?
Is it 'cause I'm jewish?

258
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,950
要知道为了和你妹妹在一起  我愿意用猪排杀了我的导师
'cause I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister.

259
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,880
这和你的宗教信仰无关
This has nothing to do with religion.

260
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,130
只是因为你还是个小男孩
This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny,

261
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,190
一个仍和妈妈一起住的小男孩
Tiny man who still lives with his mother.

262
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,510
谢尔顿  你真不讲道理
Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.

263
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,110
是吗
Am I?

264
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,030
来  吃了这片芝士能不放屁  你就可以和我妹上床
Here, eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.

265
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,980
噢  真的吗
Oh, really?

266
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,430
靠
Oops.

267
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,870
谢利  我可以和你说几句吗
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?

268
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
私下里
Alone.

269
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,420
为什么大家突然都想和我单独谈话
Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone?

270
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,800
通常没有人喜欢和我单独相处的呀
Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.

271
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,950
我们都会犯错  换一个话题吧
We all make mistakes. let's move on.

272
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,200
好吧  我不想过问你为何为了区区芝士把我推销出去
Okay, I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.

273
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,780
不过你何时开始关心我和谁上床了?
But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?

274
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,210
说实话  我从来没有考虑过
Well, truthfully, I've never given it any thought,

275
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,900
不过我后来意识到  你身上带着潜在的DNA
But it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential.

276
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,360
你在说些什么鬼话
What on earth are you talking about?

277
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,410
让我解释一下
Let me explain.

278
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,800
你知道的  我是个优秀的遗传变异产物
You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, uh,

279
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,500
对现有的次品来说存在一个显著提高
An improvement on the existing mediocre stock.

280
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,800
你说的"次品"是什么意思?
And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?

281
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,130
就是指你
That would be you.

282
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,790
不过在你身体里  有一个潜在的我
But residing within you, is the potential for another me.

283
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,990
一个可能更高  更聪明  雀斑更少的  谢尔顿2.0
Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a sheldon 2.0,

284
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,190
可以这么称呼
if you will.

285
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,900
"谢尔顿2.0"?
"sheldon 2.0"?

286
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,350
正是
Exactly.

287
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,550
现在
Now,

288
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,380
我不是说我要专横地决定你要和谁在一起
I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with.

289
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
如果你不被追求者吸引
If you're not attracted to the suitor,

290
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,850
那怀孕的可能性就会减少
Then the likelihood of conception will be reduced.

291
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,620
你开什么玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

292
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,150
完全没有
Not at all.

293
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,700
频繁性交会大大增加受精几率
Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.

294
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,390
好了  谢利  坐下
Okay, shelly, sit down.

295
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,150
我花了一辈子时间去消化这一事实  我的双胞胎哥哥
Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin

296
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,290
像妈妈所说  是个"上帝赐予的特别的小孩"
Brother is, as mom puts it, "one of god's special, little people."

297
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,440
我一直认为我更像一只布谷鸟
I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird.

298
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,870
你知道的
You know,

299
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,770
一种把蛋放在普通鸟巢里的了不起的生物
A superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.

300
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,190
当然  先孵化出的布谷鸟会吃掉所有的食物
Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food,

301
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,470
留下其他普通的兄弟姐妹们饿死
Leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death.

302
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,980
你很幸运  这就是我使用这比喻想要说的
Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.

303
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,900
我还以为你是想说"布谷"
I thought it ended at "cuckoo."

304
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,960
你听好
You listen to me.

305
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,890
如果你想做一个关心妹妹的好哥哥
If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me,

306
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,620
那太好了
Then terrific.

307
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,250
尽管来做
Bring it on.

308
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,890
但只要你有一次想告诉我该和谁上床
But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with,

309
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,550
我就得跟你回顾回顾
And you and I are going to go round and

310
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,340
我们小时候的那种方式了
Round the way we did when we were little.

311
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,620
没忘吧?
Remember?

312
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,530
-我有另外个提议  -说
I have an alternate proposal. go on.

313
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,980
你捐出卵子
You donate eggs.

314
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,890
我们把它放去低温储藏
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

315
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,990
我会帮你的卵子找一个合格的精子
I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs,

316
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,630
等他们完成受精后再植入你的体内
Have them fertilized and implanted in you.

317
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,360
这样  对每个人都好
That way, everybody wins.

318
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,560
更正下
Correction.

319
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,770
米茜想跟谁约会不关我的事
Missy can date whoever she wants.

320
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,470
我们得想办法解决下
Look, we have to settle this.

321
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,630
我同意
I agree.

322
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,460
谢尔顿的妹妹躲在佩妮家里
Sheldon's sister is hiding at penny's because

323
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,420
是因为我们在同一时间向她发起攻击
We've all been hitting on her at the same time.

324
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,760
她才没躲呢
She's not hiding.

325
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,950
她得留点私人空间来打电话给她生病的奶奶
She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick.

326
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,850
我想她还得洗她的头发
Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.

327
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
你这个傻混蛋
Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.

328
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,250
别跟我来劲  你这家伙
Don't start with me, dude.

329
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,510
你还想再来?  来啊
You want to go again? let's go.

330
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,950
-坐下  -好吧
Sit down. okay.

331
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,080
如果我们想争米茜  我们来好好地争
If we're going to fight over missy, let's do it the right way.

332
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,720
有尊严地争
The honorable way.

333
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,160
吃我一拳!
Take that!

334
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,550
还想再来?
You want some more?

335
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,600
他倒下了!
And he's down!

336
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,790
1  2  3
One, two, three...

337
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,600
来啊  快起来啊
Come on, come on! get up!

338
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,960
乖乖躺着吧  婊子
Stay down, bitch!

339
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,710
9  10
...nine, ten.

340
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,670
上帝的选择是正确的
Yeah! natural selection at work.

341
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,430
为人类感到悲哀
I weep for humanity.

342
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,760
失陪  我得去告诉米茜这个好消息
Excuse me while I go tell missy the good news.

343
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,230
-好啊  莱纳德  -好啊  佩妮
Hey, leonard. oh, hi, penny.

344
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,770
还不错吧
How's it going?

345
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,450
对了  你约会的那个对象麦克  现在还好着吗
Listen, that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?

346
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,570
算是吧  怎么了
Uh, pretty much. why?

347
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,580
没事  随便问问
Nothing, just catching up.

348
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,690
顺便  能让我跟米茜说几句吗
By the way, may I speak to missy, please?

349
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,340
当然
Of course.

350
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,190
好啊  莱纳德  什么事
Hi, leonard. what's up?

351
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,730
你明天就走了
Well, since you're leaving tomorrow,

352
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,210
我想能不能邀你一起吃顿晚饭?
I was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

353
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,030
你人真好
That's so sweet.

354
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,430
但不用了  谢谢
But no thanks.

355
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,430
你有其它安排还是...?
Oh. do you have other plans or...?

356
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,030
没有
No. oh.

357
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,690
好吧
All right, uh...

358
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,840
祝你今晚过得愉快
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

359
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,700
谢谢  再见
Thanks. see ya.

360
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,080
有点世事难料啊
Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.

361
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,720
有什么能为你效劳的  霍华德?
What do you want, howard?

362
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,170
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. thanks for asking.

363
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,560
我来拜访下米茜
I've come to call on missy.

364
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,340
米茜
Missy.

365
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,730
你好  霍华德
Hi, howard.

366
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,590
是神奇的霍华德
The amazing howard.

367
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,150
喜欢魔术吗
Do you like magic?

368
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,630
不喜欢
Not really. no.

369
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,400
那你算是赚到了
Then you are in for a treat.

370
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,050
看好  这是根普通的棍子
Behold, an ordinary cane.

371
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,010
不
No.

372
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,710
好吧
Okay.

373
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,190
米茜
Missy.

374
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,040
谢谢
Thank you.

375
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,330
很感...
I apprec...

376
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,810
感...
Apprec...

377
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
感感感...
Appreeee...

378
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,390
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

379
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,680
是不是你的药效退了?
Is your medication wearing off?

380
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,260
你好  开心果
Well, hi, cutie pie.

381
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,060
正想着你会出现呢
I was hoping you'd show up.

382
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,660
我们家养过的一只狗就发这种声音的
We had a dog who made a noise like that.

383
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,230
最后不得不弄死他
Had to put him down.

384
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,260
有什么要我跟妈说的吗
Any news you want me to pass along to mom?

385
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,910
她可能会愿意知道  我已经把研究重点
She might be interested to know that I have refocused my research

386
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,290
从玻色弦论转到了杂交弦论
From bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory.

387
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,020
我就跟她说  你向她问好吧
Yeah, I'll just tell her you say "hey."

388
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,630
很高兴能看到你
Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you,

389
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,510
除了你对我睾丸干的那事儿
Other than that business with my testicles.

390
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,090
来吧  谢利
Come on, shelly.

391
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,050
我要你知道我很以你为荣
I want you to know I'm very proud of you.

392
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,140
真的?
Really?

393
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,200
当然  我经常跟我朋友们吹嘘我哥哥
Yep, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother,

394
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,490
是火箭专家(美国人对天才科学家的习惯称呼)
The rocket scientist.

395
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,170
你跟别人说我是火箭专家?
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

396
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,240
对啊
Well, yeah.

397
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
我是个理论物理学家
I'm a theoretical physicist.

398
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,770
有什么区别
What's the difference?

399
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,720
有什么区别?!
What's the difference?!

400
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,850
我走了  谢利
Good-bye, shelly.

401
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,970
天呐
My god!

402
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,920
你怎么不跟人家说
Why don't you just tell them that

403
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,980
我是金门大桥那儿收通行税的啊?
I'm a toll-taker at the golden gate bridge?!

404
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,400
火箭专家  多丢人啊
Rocket scientist. how humiliating.
