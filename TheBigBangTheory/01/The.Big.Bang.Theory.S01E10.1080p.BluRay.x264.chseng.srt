1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,880
不  你想  液态金属终结者
No, see, the liquid-metal terminators were created

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,540
是天网系统在未来世界创造的角色
In the future by skynet,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,410
而天网系统是由麦尔斯·戴森开发的
And skynet was developed by miles dyson,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,080
但这样的未来不会存在了
But that future no longer exists

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,510
因为戴森已经在终结者2里死了
Due to dyson's death in terminator 2.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,890
好吧  但你这样想
Okay,read only this.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,960
假设所有正义的终结者一开始
Assuming all the good terminators

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,040
由天网系统创造时都是邪恶的
Were originally evil terminators created by skynet

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,010
是后来经约翰·康纳之手才重新改编了其程序
But then reprogrammed by the future john connor,

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,110
那为什么天网系统  如此一个人工智能
Why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,030
会去创造一个火辣的17岁小矮个机器人杀手?
Bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,010
因为天网系统变态?
Skynet is kinky?

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,420
我不知道
I don't know...

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,790
人工智能可不会把小屁孩当恋物
Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,580
好吧  等等  其实他们是想用它...
All right. Wait! they use it to...

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,510
太晚了  我赢了
Too late. I win.

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,700
这究竟是什么玩意?
What the hell is that?

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,520
我不知道  但如果猫可以唱歌
I don't know, but if cats could sing...

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,910
它们也会受不了这个
They'd hate it, too.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,890
好啊  伙计们
Hey, guys!

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,380
你们去哪儿?
Hi! where you going?

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,370
什么
What?

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,270
我们出去寄些信  还有...
We just had to mail some letters and...

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,560
顺便把这些鸡肉扔了
Throw away some chicken.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,210
你们肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
You'll never guess what just happened.

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,240
我猜不到
Oh, I give up.

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,240
我根本不用猜
I don't guess.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,780
作为一名科学家  我们通过
As a scientist, I reach conclusions

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,370
观察和试验来得出结论...
Based on observation and experimentation...

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,810
虽然我现在正这么说
Although as I'm saying this,

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,740
但我感觉你可能已经使用了
It occurs to me you may have been employing

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,510
某种能带修辞的表达装置来使我的回应倍受争议
A rhetorical device rendering my response moot.

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,510
那是什么东西?
What was that?

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,710
你信不信  他现在开窍了
Believe it or not, personal growth.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,770
是什么事?
What happened?

36
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,480
是这样  记不记得我曾经参加了
All right, remember when I auditioned for that workshop

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,100
出租产品展示会的试镜却没通过
Production of rent, but I didn't get it

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,240
并且我没想通是什么原因?
And I couldn't figure out why.

39
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,340
通过观察我得出了一点结论
I have a conclusion based on an observation.

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,540
不  你没有
No, you don't.

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,340
不  他没有
No, he doesn't.

42
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,020
他们选中的那个女孩
Well, the girl they picked to play mimi--

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,100
她退出了  然后他们让我替代她
She dropped out, and they asked me to replace her.

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,130
恭喜你  这是个契机啊
Congratulations. what a lucky break.

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,040
没什么大不了的  就一晚上的亮相
It's not that big a deal, just a one-night showcase,

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,380
但他们请了好多剧组人员和经纪人来
But they invite a lot of casting people and agents.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,480
去了才知道啦...
So, you never know.

48
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,360
-我想我知道  -不  你不知道
I think I know. no, you don't.

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,540
他不知道
He doesn't.

50
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,510
这周五晚8点  你们想不想来?
It's this friday night at 8:00. you guys want to come?

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,980
-不  -不
No. no.

52
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,210
因为...
Because... uh...

53
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,440
周五我们要参加一个
Friday we are attending a symposium

54
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,110
关于分子正负的研讨会
On molecular positronium.

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,710
我以为是下周二6点呢
I think that's a week from tuesday,at 6:00.

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,790
不  是这个周五
No, it's this friday.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,640
8点
At 8:00.

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,780
太遗憾了
Oh, too bad.

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,900
好了  我得去排练了
Well, I gotta get to rehearsal.

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,500
-再见了  伙计们  -再见
See you guys. see ya.

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,380
你刚才对潘妮撒了谎
You just lied to penny.

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,140
-是  我撒了谎  -而且你表现得
Yes, I did. and you did it

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,610
如此从容  没有呼吸急促
So casually-- no rapid breathing,

64
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,450
也没有冒汗
No increase in perspiration...

65
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,480
所以说?
So?

66
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,410
所以说  你撒谎时缺乏生理反应
So, lack of a physiological response while lying

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,300
这是反社会暴力狂的特点
Is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,550
谢尔顿  你是在担心你的人身安全吗
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,620
不  我想如果你要杀了我
No, I imagine if you were going to kill me,

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,580
你早就下手了
You'd have done it a long time ago.

71
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,250
说得非常正确
That's very true.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,230
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第10集
The.Loobenfeld.Decay

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,380
莱纳德
Leonard?

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,580
莱纳德
Leonard?

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,910
-莱纳德  -干嘛
Leonard? what?

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,510
我得找你谈谈
I need to speak to you.

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,220
现在是凌晨2点
It's 2:00 in the morning!

78
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
很重要的事
It's important.

79
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,850
我严重怀疑
I highly doubt that.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,550
走开
Go away.

81
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,490
你还在外面吗
Are you still out there?

82
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,110
没错
Yes.

83
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,240
干嘛
What?

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,540
你说的对  我们还是天亮了再说吧
You're right; it can wait until morning.

85
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,940
什么  什么  什么  什么  什么
What, what, what, what, what?

86
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,310
没事儿
Never mind.

87
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,010
很明显我在你熟睡的时候叫醒了你
I clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle.

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,640
你根本就没心情听我说话
You're in no state of mind to talk.

89
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,630
谢尔顿  到底什么事
Sheldon, what is it?

90
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,640
卷入了你对潘妮的欺骗事件我感到很不舒服
I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,440
那我应该怎么说
What was I supposed to say?

92
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,810
你可以跟她说实话
You could have told her the truth.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
那样会伤害她的
That would have hurt her feelings.

94
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,910
这跟伤害她有什么关系?
Is that a relevant factor?

95
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,310
当然有
Yes.

96
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,540
那我想你应该答应她去的
Then I suppose you could've agreed to go.

97
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,160
那我之后该怎么说?
And what would I have said afterwards?

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,350
我会这么说
I would suggest something to be a fact of

99
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,580
唱歌对你来说既不是一个合适的职业
Singing is neither an appropriate vocation

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,040
也不是合适的副业  如果你不同意
Nor avocation for you, and if you disagree,

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,530
我建议你去做一个X光断层扫描
I'd recommend you have a cat scan

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,610
看看是不是有肿瘤
To look for a tumor pressing

103
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,360
压迫到了你大脑的认知处理单元
On the cognitive processing centers of your brain.

104
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,400
我可说不出来
I couldn't say that.

105
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,340
我只会说  你真的太棒了
I would have to say, "you were terrific

106
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,840
我好想再听一遍你的歌声
And I can't wait to hear you sing again."

107
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,180
为什么
Why?

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,290
这是人们交际的法则
That's the social protocol.

109
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,610
当你朋友对自己很烂的东西引以为傲时
It's what you do when you have a friend

110
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,770
你就应该这么做
Who's proud of something they really suck at.

111
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,480
我以前不知道
I was not aware of that.

112
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,110
那你现在知道了
Well, now you are. oh.

113
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,840
好吧  莱纳德
All right. leonard?

114
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,730
怎么
Yes?

115
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,220
记得我们以前玩国际象棋吗
When we played chess earlier,

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,730
你真的太棒了  我真想能有机会再跟你切磋
You were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

117
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,270
晚安
Good night.

118
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,560
莱纳德
Leonard?

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,700
莱纳德
Leonard?

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,840
莱纳德
Leonard?

121
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,780
如果我真是反社会暴力狂
This would be so much easier

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,040
那就好办多了
If I were a violent sociopath.

123
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,510
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard? leonard?

124
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,980
怎么了
What?

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,940
我刚才分析了下我们的谎话  我在想
I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger

126
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,010
潘妮要是看穿了我们的骗局  我们就危险了
Of penny seeing through the ruse.

127
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,410
怎么会
How?

128
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,110
很简单  如果她登陆
Simple, If she were to log onto

129
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,810

然后查找分子正负的研讨会
And look for the seminar on molecular positronium,

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
那可好了
Well than...

134
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,180
我们就要火烧屁股了
Our pants are metaphorically on fire.

135
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,610
好吧  先生  我今天不会让火烧到我屁股的
Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.

136
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,380
潘妮
Penny?

137
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,580
潘妮
Penny?

138
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,980
潘妮
Penny?

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
早上好
Good morning.

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,380
你知不知道现在几点?
Do you have any idea what time it is?

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,550
我当然知道
Of course I do.

142
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,110
我的手表连接着科罗拉多州的
My watch is linked to the atomic clock

143
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,410
波尔得的原子钟
In boulder, colorado.

144
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,680
精确到0.1秒
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

145
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,010
但我在这说话的同时  再一次
But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,910
我感觉你的问题可能是带修辞性的
That, once again, your question may have been rhetorical.

147
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,540
你要干什么
What do you want?

148
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,810
还记得莱纳德怎么跟你说
Remember how leonard told you

149
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
为什么我们不能去看你表演吗
We couldn't come to your performance

150
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,910
因为我们要参加研讨会
Because we were attending a symposium

151
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,780
关于分子正负的
On molecular positronium?

152
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,180
我记得有个研讨会
I remember "symposium."

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,140
是的  那是他骗你的
Yes. well... he lied.

154
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,340
等等
Wait.

155
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,410
什么
What?

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,410
他跟你撒谎了
He lied

157
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,840
我对此感到很忐忑不安
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.

158
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,080
知道我是什么感觉吗
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

159
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,320
饿?
Hungry?

160
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,170
累?
Tired?

161
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,830
对不起  这真的不是我的强项
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

162
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,850
你告诉他我骗她?
You told her I lied?

163
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,710
你为什么要告诉她我骗她?
Why would you tell her I lied?

164
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,790
为了帮你
To help you.

165
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,790
不好意思  我没看到哪里有帮助
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

166
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,280
她最终肯定会看穿你的谎言
She was going to see through your lie eventually,

167
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,400
所以  为了保护我  我告诉她你撒了谎
So I told her that you were lying to protect me.

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,490
我有种不好的感觉
Ohh... I'm getting a bad feeling.

169
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,340
饿了?
Hunger?

170
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,490
消化不良?
Indigestion?

171
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,060
对不起  我真的不擅长这个
I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this.

172
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,030
总之
Anyway,

173
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,110
潘妮现在已经相信
Penny now believes that, on friday night,

174
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,410
周五的晚上我们要去参加
We're going to participate

175
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,520
我表弟里奥珀德的戒毒调停会
In my cousin leopold's drug intervention.

176
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,640
你的表弟里奥珀德
Your cousin leopold.

177
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,840
大部分人叫他里奥  但你叫他里他也会答应
Who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee.

178
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,410
记住这点  这很关键
Remember that. it's important.

179
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,930
有什么好关键的?
What's important?

180
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,580
细节  莱纳德
Details, leonard-- the success

181
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
骗人的成功或失败
Or failure of our deceitful enterprise

182
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,270
就是取决于细节
Turns on details.

183
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,210
-你真有个表弟叫里奥珀德?  -没有
Do you have a cousin leopold? no.

184
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,510
他是我捏造的
I made him up.

185
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,140
我觉得你应该叫他里
I think you'd call him lee.

186
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,310
我不明白了
I don't get it.

187
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,840
我已经跟她撒过一次谎了
I already told her a lie.

188
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,680
为什么要再撒一个不同的谎?
Why replace it with a different lie?

189
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,010
首先  你的谎话很可笑且容易被识破
Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent,

190
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,440
而我的却十分缜密且难以识破
Where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

191
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,760
在你睡觉的时候
While you were sleeping,

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,250
我组建了一个"非不可解释"网站
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

193
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,790
非不可解释?
Un-unravelable?

194
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,740
是的
Yes.

195
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,610
如果她在Google里搜索"里奥珀德·休斯顿"
If she googles "leopold houston,"

196
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,000
她会找到一个Facebook(美国交友网站)页面
She'll find a facebook page,

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,340
一个在线博客  里面有描述他吸毒走向堕落的过程
An online blog depicting his descent into drug use

198
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,280
而且在Eharmony.com(美国婚介网站)有个绝望但仍有希望的名单
And a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony.com.

199
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,010
好吧  但是为什么
Okay, why would I go

200
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,240
我要去参加你表弟的戒毒调停会
To a drug intervention for your cousin?

201
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,480
因为那在长滩  而我又不会开车
Ah! because it's in long beach, and I don't drive.

202
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,110
我们要去长滩?
We're going to long beach?

203
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,780
不  当然不  根本就没有表弟里奥
No, of course not. there's no cousin leo.

204
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,980
也没有调停会
There's no intervention.

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,280
动动脑子  莱纳德
Focus, leonard.

206
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,310
不会吧
Aw, come on.

207
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,200
我们只需要在周五晚上离开家
We just leave the house on friday night and we return

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,260
然后等到凌晨再回来
In the wee hours, emotionally wrung out,

209
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,280
带着一幅坚信里奥回戒毒所后能改邪归正的表情
From the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab.

210
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,310
他还要回戒毒所?
He goes back into rehab?

211
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,940
没错  并且  要是潘妮再邀请我们听她唱歌
Yes, but, he can relapse if penny

212
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,080
他随时可以毒瘾发作的
Ever invites us to hear her sing again.

213
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,740
你毕竟还是告诉她我撒谎了
You still told her I lied.

214
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,510
但初衷很高尚的  你是为了帮助我
For a noble purpose-- to spare me

215
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,640
避免让人知道我有个吸毒的弟弟
The social embarrassment

216
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,910
这一让人尴尬的事情
Of having a drug-addled first cousin--

217
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,410
我假设这是很尴尬  对吗
Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?

218
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,280
我怎么可能记住这么多乱七八糟的
How am I supposed to remember all of this?

219
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,880
最精彩的部分到了  你根本不用去记
Oh, that's the best part. you don't have to.

220
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,840
我对潘妮说如果你发现
See, I told penny that you would be embarrassed

221
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,080
她知道你骗她的话  你会很尴尬
If you knew that she found out that you had lied,

222
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,480
所以  她同意装作像上个谎话
So she's agreed to operate

223
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,280
还没被拆穿一样  装作什么都不知道
As if the original lie is still in force.

224
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,140
所以她以为我是撒谎
So she's expecting me to lie about going

225
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,480
说去帕萨迪纳市开研讨会
To a symposium in pasadena,

226
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,280
而实际上  我们假装正要去
When, in actuality, we're pretending

227
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,610
长滩参加你弟弟的戒毒调停会
To go to a drug intervention in long beach.

228
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,710
非不可解释
Un-unravelable.

229
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,140
潘妮
Oh, hey, penny.

230
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,680
你看看你  都整装待发准备好演出了
Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase.

231
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,000
-你看上去真漂亮  -谢谢
You look great. thanks.

232
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,470
我只是想过来看看并且祝你们好运
I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck

233
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,330
关于你们的...研讨会
With your... symposium.

234
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,090
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

235
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,670
我必须要跟你说  很多人都会
You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends

236
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,090
让他们的朋友孤零零一个人
Would let their friend go alone,

237
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,190
但你不是这样的人
But that's not who you are.

238
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,170
你是那种总陪在朋友身边的人
You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend

239
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,290
即使当他有个...研讨会要去参加
When... when he has a symposium to go to.

240
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,780
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say.

241
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,730
没事的  莱纳德
It's okay, leonard.

242
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,770
哦  好的  不错
Oh, okay, all right, good.

243
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,560
伙计  大家一起来抱抱
Oh, boy, group hug. uh-uh.

244
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,360
好吧
Okay.

245
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,630
怎么了?
So, what's up?

246
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,750
潘妮正要去一个
Well, penny is on her way to perform

247
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,000
出租用品展示会进行表演
In a one-night showcase production of rent,

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,060
而我们不能去了  因为我们要去参加
Which we are unable to attend, because we're going

249
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,860
由伊米尔·法尔曼法尔米安博士主讲的
To a symposium on molecular positronium

250
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,660
关于分子正负的研讨会
Given by dr. emil farmanfarmian.

251
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,620
等等  法尔曼法尔米安要来
Wait a minute-- farmanfarmian is speaking

252
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,690
而你们竟然霸占这个研讨会?
And you're bogarting the symposium?

253
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,590
霍华德  对不...我们...
Howard, I'm sorr... we-we...

254
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,110
不  不  你们保密到连夸克都透不过
No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,000
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say.

256
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,760
-霍华德  听着...  -不  没关系
Howard, listen... no, it's okay.

257
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,030
那是你的命根子
It's your millennium falcon.

258
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,080
你可以跟楚巴卡(体型高大、身披毛发的战士)得到任何你们想要的
You and chewbacca do whatever you want to do.

259
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,860
我跟莱娅公主(星战人物)
Me and princess leia here

260
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,130
会找点别的事来度过今晚
Will find some other way to spend the evening.

261
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,290
霍华德  等等
Howard, wait. wai...

262
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
谢尔顿  我觉得我们得告诉他们
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

263
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,930
好吧  当然可以
Okay, sure.

264
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,430
我觉得没有任何问题
I don't see a problem with that.

265
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,090
根本就没有什么研讨会
There's no symposium.

266
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,760
莱纳德跟我撒了谎  是不是  莱纳德?
Leonard lied to me. isn't that right, leonard?

267
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,050
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to say!

268
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,380
没关系  我来说
It's okay; I do.

269
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,960
莱纳德其实在帮谢尔顿解决家庭危机
Look, leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis.

270
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,460
他编了整个什么研讨会的故事
He made up the whole story about the symposium

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,610
什么法尔曼...法尔米安...博士
With dr. farman... farmian...

272
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,370
你真强
Good for you.

273
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,290
因为他不想让谢尔顿尴尬
...because he didn't want sheldon to be embarrassed.

274
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,330
其实这根本没什么可尴尬的  知道吗
And there is nothing to be embarrassed about, okay?

275
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,790
在美国谁家都会有个亲戚
Every family in america has a relative

276
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,990
干点不大光彩的事情
Holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.

277
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,600
不  我也糊涂了
No, I'm lost, too.

278
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,590
我觉得她跳过了一步
I think she skipped a step.

279
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,960
不是  你们听我说
No, look.

280
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,210
谢尔顿的表弟里奥逃离了戒毒所
Sheldon's cousin leo escaped rehab,

281
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,800
他现在躲在长滩的一家汽车旅馆
And he's in a motel 8 in long beach.

282
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,060
他们全家出动参加调停会
The whole family's going out for an intervention.

283
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,790
莱纳德要开车送谢尔顿去
Leonard is driving sheldon down there

284
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,630
帮他表弟渡过难关  因为他真的是个好人哦
To help him through this, because he's such a good man.

285
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,090
又抱我一次?  谢谢
Oh, another hug? thank you.

286
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,860
好了  朋友们  祝你们好运
All right, you guys, good luck.

287
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,960
谢谢  潘妮
Thanks, penny.

288
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,160
祝你演出成功
Oh-- break a leg.

289
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,260
演出成功
Break a leg.

290
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,960
开车去长滩
So, road trip to long beach.

291
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,730
不  我们不去长滩
No. we're not going to long beach.

292
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,410
为什么
Why not?

293
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,960
因为谢尔顿根本就没有一个
Because sheldon doesn't have

294
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,590
吸毒的叫里奥珀德的表弟
A drug-addicted cousin leopold.

295
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,630
太遗憾了
Oh, too bad.

296
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,080
我一直都想去长滩
I've always wanted to go to long beach.

297
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,790
的确是个不错的地方
It's a very nice community.

298
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,430
玛丽女王号就停靠在那里
The queen mary is docked there.

299
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,510
它曾是世上最大的远洋客轮
Once the largest ocean liner in the world,

300
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,810
现在成了一家酒店和餐厅
It's now a hotel and restaurant,

301
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,630
为顾客提供极其扣人心弦的
Where they host a surprisingly gripping

302
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,530
离奇谋杀主题晚宴
Murder mystery dinner.

303
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,790
听起来挺有趣  我要去
Sounds fun. I'm game.

304
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,790
出发!
Shotgun!

305
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,860
别  别  别
No, no, no.

306
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,330
莱纳德要坐前排  否则他会恶心呕吐
Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front,

307
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,760
不过即便这样  也很难保证
And even then, it's iffy.

308
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,530
等等  我们...真要去长滩啊?!
Wait, are we... really going to long beach?!

309
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,790
莱纳德
Leonard?

310
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,630
莱纳德  莱纳德
Leonard? leonard?

311
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,230
别再想了  谢尔顿
Let it go, sheldon.

312
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,480
不管你觉得说不说得通
The murderer was the first mate

313
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,030
谋杀犯就是第一个同事
Whether it makes sense to you or not.

314
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,890
不是  我才不关心那个呢
No, that's the least of our worries.

315
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,190
我一直在做一些关于吸毒方面的研究...
I've been doing some research on addiction--

316
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,430
既有生物化学方面的也有行为方面的...
Both the biochemical and behavioral aspects--

317
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,500
我觉得我们现在这个
And I think there's a problem

318
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,540
版本的谎话有个问题
With the current version of our lie.

319
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,710
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

320
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,360
无所谓了  她相信了  都结束了
It's fine-- she bought it; it's over.

321
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,870
可惜的是  并没有
Sadly, it's not.

322
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,910
对抗毒品不是一朝一夕的事
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle,

323
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,960
抛开这点  我意识到我所描述的这个里奥
But beyond that, I have realized that the leo I described

324
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,550
根本就不会同意到戒毒所接受治疗
Would not have agreed to go to rehab.

325
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,360
为什么
Why not?

326
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,330
因为里奥是中间儿
Because leo's a middle child.
中间儿综合症是指排行老二或者排在中间的孩子，
由于没有老大或最小的孩子那么“受关注”，因此产生的一些心理问题

327
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,130
根本就没里奥这个人!
There is no leo!

328
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,190
你怎么就能说这些?
How can you say that?

329
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,610
你没读过他的简历  是吗
You didn't read the bio, did you?

330
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,710
他不仅是个中间儿
He's not just a middle child,

331
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,350
他更是个典型的中间儿...
He is the quintessential middle child--

332
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,890
附:他出自破碎家庭
From a broken home, to boot.

333
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,360
从心理学上讲  即使会导致自我毁灭
Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling,

334
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,290
对他来说  通过反抗所获得的关注度
Even to the point of self-destruction,

335
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,860
在情感上的价值要远远超过康复治疗所带来的效果
Is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.

336
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,330
我倒有个主意
I've got a solution.

337
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,230
太好了  什么
Great. what is it?

338
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,760
出  去!
Get out!

339
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,660
好吧
Fine.

340
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,250
我一直犹豫要不要说
I've hesitated to point this out,

341
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,030
但我必须提醒你的是
But I must now remind you that we

342
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,960
我们目前的窘境完全是因为你先前
Are in our current predicament because of your initial

343
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,470
理由相当不充分的欺骗行为造成的
And totally inadequate deceit.

344
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,790
我只是想替你收拾残局而已
I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.

345
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,510
我们明早再说
We'll talk in the morning.

346
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,710
早
Morning.

347
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,170
你是谁
Who are you?

348
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,020
我是谢尔顿的表弟里奥
I am sheldon's cousin leo.

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,030
谢尔顿根本没有一个叫里奥的表弟
Sheldon does not have a cousin leo.

350
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,880
恰恰相反
Au contraire.

351
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,440
我今年26岁
I'm 26 years old.

352
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,130
我的祖籍是...德克萨斯州的登顿市
I'm originally from... denton, texas,

353
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,130
但我是个海军顽童  所以我从小
But I was a navy brat, so I was

354
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,490
是在世界各地的军事基地长大的
Brought up on a variety of military bases around the world.

355
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,180
因此  我总感觉跟群体格格不入...
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider--

356
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,560
从没真正融入过
Never really fitting in,

357
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,930
这也很可能是我滥用毒品的原因
Which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.

358
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,360
打扰一下  我们刚才还练习过一遍
Excuse me, we just went over this.

359
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,900
作为一个典型的中间儿  你的赌瘾
As the quintessential middle child, your addiction

360
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,230
根植于你未被满足的对关注度的需求当中
Is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

361
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,330
谢尔顿  我们不是真的要用通俗心理学吧?
Oh, sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?

362
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,930
请注意  这些都是以有力的研究为根据的
For your information, this is all based on solid research.

363
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,630
完全依照我写给你的性格档案就行了
Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you.

364
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,930
-谢尔顿?  -不好意思
Sheldon? I'm sorry.

365
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,370
莱纳德  这位是托比·鲁本菲尔德
Leonard, this is toby loobenfeld.

366
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,700
他是粒子物理实验室的
He's a research assistant

367
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,130
一名研究助理
In the particle physics lab,

368
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,520
不过他同时在麻省理工辅修戏剧
But he also minored in theater at mit.

369
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,690
事实上  说双学位更准确些
It was more of a double major, actually.

370
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,000
戏剧和物理
Theater and physics.

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,990
可以猜一下哪门是我中产阶级的父母
You can guess which one my bourgeois parents

372
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,830
逼我学的
Pushed me toward.

373
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,190
行了  我知道了
Yeah, I got it.

374
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,290
谢尔顿...你这是为什么
Sheldon... why?

375
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,190
你想啊  鉴于里奥不会去接受康复治疗
You see, while leo would not have gone into rehab,

376
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,090
那我们把他从汽车旅馆劝回家
It is completely plauible that we would have talked him

377
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,930
就是完全可以解释通的了
Into leaving the motel and coming home with us.

378
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,090
谢尔顿  这样设计
Oh... sheldon, how about this

379
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,260
我的动机如何...我14岁那年
As my motivation-- when I was 14 years old,

380
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,830
在菲律宾被一个先天脚畸形的海军教士虐待
I was abused in the philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain.

381
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,160
不行  就设计成一个中间儿
No. we're going with middle child

382
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,050
具有血液中复合胺含量不足的遗传体质倾向
And a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.

383
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,550
亏你想得出来  遗传体质你要我怎么扮?
Swell. how do I play genetic predisposition?

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,830
当然是如字面意思所示
Subtextually, of course.

385
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,320
尽情享受就好了
Just have fun with it.

386
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,330
早  潘妮
Morning, penny.

387
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,990
家庭会议开得怎么样?
Hi. how did the intervention go?

388
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,430
很不幸  我们没能说服他去戒毒所接受治疗
Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.

389
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,220
基于你昨天跟我说的那些  我一点都不惊讶
Oh. well, based on what you told me, I am not surprised.

390
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,160
但我们说服他搬出汽车旅馆了
But we did convince him to leave the motel.

391
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,730
进来认识一下
Come say hello.

392
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,560
里奥  这位是潘妮
Leo. this is penny,

393
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,730
我们的朋友和邻居
Our friend and neighbor.

394
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,290
你好  里奥
Hi, leo.

395
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,190
你现在感觉如何
How are you feeling?

396
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,190
潘妮  问你个问题
Let me ask you something, penny.

397
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,960
你有过吐得浑身都是  然后一觉醒来
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel

398
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,660
发现自己身在一个破烂的汽车旅馆
Covered in your own vomit,

399
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,690
身边还躺着个人妖妓女的经历吗
Next to a transsexual prostitute?

400
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,690
没有
No.

401
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,030
那就别问我感觉如何
Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

402
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,460
这位就是里奥
Well, that's leo.

403
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,530
跟我说说你昨晚的演出吧
Why don't you tell me about your showcase last night.

404
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,960
还好啦  我觉得
Oh. it was okay, I guess.

405
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,000
场面不算太热烈
It wasn't a big turnout,

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,960
但他俩好像都很喜欢我的表演
But they both really seemed to like it.

407
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,690
就俩人?
There were only two people there?

408
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,290
坚持到最后的  是的
By the end, yeah.

409
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,730
你个该死的哈里根教士!
Damn you, chaplain harrigan!

410
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,060
你...你说什么
I'm... I'm sorry?

411
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,930
那是在菲律宾的时候
The philippines.

412

一个年轻的男孩即将步入成年

416
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,890
杂种狗和疟疾蚊子

绝望交织着孤独

418

他遇见这个许诺将他引荐给

除了用酗酒  吸毒

426

427
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,110
怎么可能实施双盲试验?

谁来做对照组?

431

437
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,450
这比你亲自去看演出都要精彩

438
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,330
因为我要看着你看着我唱歌

440
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,270
事情的进展真搞笑

441
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,330
...可是他喜欢那些同伴

442
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,060
还有他的父亲无法给予他的智慧
And the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.

443
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,600
你父母做了正确的决定

444

不酗酒  不磕药

也不用担心你是个人妖
