1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,830
天啊  我爱死这鸡肉了
Oh, my God. I love this chicken.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,610
常言道  金肉  银肉
Oh, you know what they say,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,850
比不上免费的鸡肉
best things in life are free.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,700
是是是  我是吃了你不少东西
Okay, you're right. I eat your food a lot.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,240
不如这样吧
Now, how about this?

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,360
我也让你随时去我冰箱找东西吃
You can raid my fridge anytime you want.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,200
还真是"良心"发现啊
Oh, that's very kind of you.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,410
等下次我想吃"汁多味美"的一号电池
Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D-cell battery

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,310
再配一罐陈年腌瓜汁时
with a jar of old pickle juice,

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,760
我会去找你的
I'll come a-knockin'.

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,220
拉杰  你没有回复我的婚礼邀请函啊
Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,100
我得知道你是否会带女伴来
I'm suppose to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,130
我再通知你
I'll let you know.

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,010
能快点吗
Well, can you make it soon?

15
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,500
有人在打擂台要抢婚礼席位呢
There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,150
擂台一角有伯纳黛特的老妈
In one corner, Bernadette's mom,

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,190
而另三角  是我老妈
in the other three, mine.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,120
我最讨厌去婚宴了
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,090
真希望新郎新娘能学学比尔博·巴金斯
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

20
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,060
比尔博·巴金斯  《魔戒》人物  曾是至尊魔戒的持有者
戴上魔戒后  有隐身的功能

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,110
戴上戒指  隐身  大家就各回各家
Slip on the ring, disappear, and everyone goes home.

22
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,610
你不是挺喜欢盖瑟教授的婚礼吗
Mm, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,140
他婚礼上有个圣代自助吧
They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,160
多么令人难忘的一夜啊
Oh, that was a night to remember.

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,480
告诉你  有次我从头到尾就只吃了碗坚果
Do you know, on one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.

26
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,420
总而言之  你带不带人来都得赶紧通知我
Anyway, you got to let me know if you have a plus one.

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,710
你不带人的话  位子就让给那位
Because if not, my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,830
帮我妈脖子做抽脂的医生啦
who sucked the fat out of her neck.

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,100
好吧  行
All right, uh, fine.

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
我会来  而且会携伴出席
I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,780
库萨帕里  加个伴
Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,470
你带谁来啊
Who you bringing?

33
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,830
你又带谁来啊
Who are you bringing?!

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,870
他带我来啊  你带谁呢
He's bringing me; who are you bringing?

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,190
哎哟  好一群多管闲事的美国佬啊
Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

36
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,690
说嘛  带谁呢
Come on, who is it?

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,910
就是不说
I'm not telling.

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,980
我是神秘的亚洲人  天机不可泄露
I'm from Asia, I'm mysterious, deal with it.

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,220
霍华德  你会弄个圣代自助吧吗
Howard aren't having a make-your-own-sundae bar?

40
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,780
应该不会吧
I don't think so.

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,740
那我建议你弄一个
Well, you should.

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,980
五成的婚姻都是以离婚告终
50% of marriages end in divorce,

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,430
但十成十的圣代自助吧都是以幸福收场
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae bars end in happiness.

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,610
生活大爆炸第五季第二十集

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,680
妈妈  爸爸  你们好吗
Hello, Mummy, Daddy. How are you?

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,980
还行  没啥好抱怨的
Pretty good. Can't complain.

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,120
亲爱的  你肯定行
Oh, I'm sure you can.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
酝酿一下  抱怨自然来
Just give it a minute.

49
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,540
是这样的
Listen, uh,

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,490
我想告诉你们一件事
there's something I want to talk to you about.

51
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,390
之前我一直没做好心理准备
I wasn't ready until now, but...

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,990
现在时机已到
I think it's time.

53
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,290
终究还是发生了
It's finally happening.

54
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,590
你要出柜了  对吧
You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,780
我们爱你  也能接受你不同的生活方式
We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle.

56
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,430
你别...张扬乱搞就行了
Just... keep it to yourself.

57
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,980
没有  我才不是同性恋
No, I'm not gay.

58
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,750
人家顶多是都市花美男
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

59
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,450
那是什么啊
What's that?

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,940
就是  我爱女人  也爱她们的保养品
It means I like women as well as their skin-care products.

61
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,700
好吧  如果你不是要出柜
Well, if you're not coming out,

62
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,680
在印度  板球是非常火热的运动
那干嘛还打扰我们看板球半决赛
why did you call us during the cricket semifinals?

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,030
在人海中寻觅真爱的日子  我过累了
I'm tired of trying to meet someone,

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,380
我想请你们帮忙我找个...
and I think I'd like you to help me find a...

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,160
老婆
a wife.

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,350
我就问清楚
And just to clarify...

67
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,310
是女性的老婆吗
a female wife?

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,010
是的
Yes!

69
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,380
包办婚姻  聪明的选择啊  儿子
Matchmaking-- very smart move, son.

70
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,910
比自由恋爱的婚姻好多了
Much better than marrying for love.

71
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,240
我们当初就是自由恋爱的啊
We married for love.

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,330
所以过得多么幸福美满啊
And it's been wonderful!

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
量子力学真让我满心欢喜
Quantum physics makes me so happy.

74
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,730
恭喜恭喜
Yeah, I'm glad.

75
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,910
如同看着一丝不挂的宇宙
It's like looking at the universe naked.

76
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,270
能打扰一下吗
Hi. Guys got a minute?

77
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,600
行啊  什么事
Sure. What's up?

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,050
我想到谢尔顿开的小玩笑
Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke

79
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,800
就那天晚上说我老蹭你们东西吃
the other night about me eating all your food.

80
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,140
那不是在开玩笑  不过...
Oh! That was no joke. But...

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,030
我能理解你以为我是说笑
I understand your confusion,

82
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,580
毕竟我一直是咱们小团体中的笑话王
as I am our group's resident cutup.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
不是吧  你还是小团体中的笑话王吗
I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,880
当然
Yes.

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,540
证明一下
Oh, prove it.

86
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,260
敲敲门  敲敲门
Knock-knock.

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,770
-谁呢  -插嘴物理学家
- Who's there? - Interrupting physicist.

88
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,030
这改编自插嘴牛的笑话
当对方问牛怎么插嘴  你就用牛叫声[哞Moo]插嘴
-物理学家怎么插...   -介子[哞哞]
- Interrupting phys... - Muon!

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,520
言归正传  我收到了我广告的尾款
Anyway, I got a little residual check from my commercial,

90
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,220
我想了想  不如给你们
and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys

91
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,510
买点感恩礼物当做回报吧
a little thank you to pay them back?

92
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,910
所以呢  谢尔顿
So, Sheldon...

93
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,640
你看
ta-da!

94
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,990
未拆封的经典
A vintage mint-in-box

95
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,930
1975年米果公司出产的星际迷航传送机
1975 Mego Star Trek Transporter

96
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,490
还会有真实的传送特效
with real transporter action.

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,660
帅爆了
Hot darn!

98
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,770
你去哪里买的啊
Where did you get that?

99
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,460
斯图尔特的漫画店里买的
From Stuart, at the comic book store.

100
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,930
你孤身一人走进了漫画店啊
You went to the comic book store by yourself?

101
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,950
是啊  挺好玩的
Yeah. It was fun.

102
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,780
我一走进  俩男的立刻被迷得哮喘发作
I walked in, and two different guys got asthma attacks.

103
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,340
感觉真爽啊
Felt pretty good.

104
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,110
这个应该表示一下感谢
This calls for an expression of gratitude.

105
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,670
哟  是不是要给我一个罕见的谢氏拥抱
Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

106
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,050
这次不行  不然我的拥抱就掉价了
No, not this time. Then they wouldn't be special.

107
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,830
谢了  佩妮
Thanks, Penny.

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,880
不客气
You're welcome.

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,990
别担心  我没忘记你
Don't worry, I didn't forget about you.

110
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,970
莱纳德  我给你买了
Leonard, I got you...

111
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,700
一个标签机
a label-maker!

112
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,460
哇
Wow...

113
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,530
真好
No, it's great.

114
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,610
也是全新没开封的
Also mint-in-box. Mm.

115
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,090
我也给你买了个传送机
And I got you a transporter, too!

116
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,950
太帅了
Awesome!

117
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,060
这是专门配我的珍藏版史波克模型的呢
Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

118
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,080
那太好了  我们快拆开把他放进传送机吧
Oh, that's great! Let's open them up and put him in there.

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,870
-打开?!  -老天啊  不行
- Open it?! - Oh, good Lord, no!

120
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,380
为什么  玩具不是拿来玩的吗
Why? They're just toys.

121
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,300
-拿来收藏的  -全新没开封的
- They're collectibles. - They're mint-in-box.

122
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,190
拜托  打开来看看也不行吗
Come on. Can't we open one up and take a look?

123
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,670
不行
No, don't!

124
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,590
一旦开封了就不值钱了
Once you open the box, it loses its value.

125
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,070
我妈也曾教育我  要用这种态度对待童贞
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity.

126
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,970
不过我觉得  与其收着发霉
Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun

127
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,970
不如拿出来多晒晒"太阳"
taking it out and playing with it.

128
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,850
你确定要我们陪你见相亲对象吗
Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?

129
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,600
确定
Oh, yes.

130
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,640
按照我们的习俗
In my culture, it's expected

131
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,140
相亲时就得带个伴来帮过过眼
to have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

132
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,350
况且我想留个好印象  说了你们别生气
Plus, I want to make a good impression, and no offense,

133
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,630
跟你们在一起  我看上去就像一米八的
but with you guys here, I look like I'm six-two.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,710
我们高中舞会时修女也老是盯着我们
The nuns always chaperoned the dances at my high school.

135
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,970
她们总是要我们保持距离  留点空间给圣灵
They used to make us leave room between us for the Holy Spirit.

136
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,170
印度人也这样
Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

137
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,250
只不过他们留空间给牛
Except they leave room for a cow.

138
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,320
我很欣赏你的种族歧视幽默感
Listen, I love your charming racist humor,

139
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,470
但能不能别在女人面前  嘲笑我的宗教信仰呢
but any chance you could not mock my religion while she's here?

140
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,300
你昨天还笑我吃熏鲑鱼呢
Yesterday, you made fun of me for eating lox.

141
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,510
那不一样  你们犹太人又不崇拜鲑鱼
It's different, your people don't worship lox.

142
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,640
显然你没跟我堂兄妹吃过早午餐
Clearly, you've never been to brunch with my cousins.

143
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,360
包办婚姻是不是双方父母一旦决定
So, arranged marriages-- the parents just decide

144
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
你们就得结婚
and then you have to get married?

145
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,990
不是  我有说话权的
No, no, I get a say in it.

146
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,950
不过我相信不管什么样的人来
But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company

147
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,060
都比跟杰迈玛大婶和巴特沃斯夫人
than the threesome I've been having
杰迈玛大婶和巴特沃斯夫人均为食品品牌名称

148
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,610
在厨房里玩3P要好得多
with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

149
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,560
请问  你是拉杰什吗
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

150
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,790
我是
Ah, yes.

151
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,050
你应该是拉克希米吧
You must be Lakshmi.

152
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,040
很高兴认识你
Uh, nice to meet you.

153
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,580
我也是
Nice to meet you, too.

154
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,940
这两位是我朋友
Oh! These are my friends.

155
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,450
-这位是伯纳黛特  -你好
- This is Bernadette. - Hello.

156
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,180
-这位是霍华德  -幸会
- And this is Howard. - Nice to meet you.

157
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,280
-幸会  -请坐
- You, too. - Please, have a seat.

158
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
双重婚礼有戏了
I'm thinking double wedding.

159
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,780
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper.

160
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,160
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper?

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,550
谁在说话
Is someone there?

162
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,240
在这里  你桌子上
Down here. On your desk.

163
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,410
史波克
Spock?

164
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,520
我需要跟你谈谈
I need to speak with you.

165
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,570
太奇妙了
Fascinating.

166
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,740
唯一合乎逻辑的解释就是  这是梦
The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.

167
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,950
做梦也不是唯一合乎逻辑的解释
It is not the only logical explanation.

168
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,340
比如  你之所以产生幻觉
For example, you could be hallucinating

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,430
是因为被某物砸到头  比如说
after being hit on the head by,say,

170
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,150
椰子
a coconut.

171
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
我真的被椰子砸到头了?
Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

172
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,770
我不想就此做出任何回应
I am not going to dignify that with a response.

173
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,870
先说要紧事
Now to the matter at hand.

174
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,810
你要玩这个传送机玩具
You need to play with the transporter toy.

175
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,470
可这是全新没开封的
But it's mint-in-box.

176
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,210
没错
Yes.

177
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,660
而且开封了就毁了它的价值
And to open it would destroy its value.

178
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,310
但你要记住  你跟我一样
But remember, like me,

179
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,910
也有一半人类血统
you also have a human half.

180
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,910
我不想就此做出任何回应
Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

181
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,060
你想一想
Consider this.

182
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,590
玩具的意义在于什么
What is the purpose of a toy?

183
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,070
给人玩
To be played with.

184
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,270
那么  不给人玩意味着...
Therefore, to not play with it would be...?

185
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,280
不合常理
Illogical.

186
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,170
该死  史波克  你说得对
Damn it, Spock, you're right.

187
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,490
我这就开封
I'll do it.

188
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,030
谢尔顿  等等
Sheldon, wait.

189
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,790
你得先醒来
You have to wake up first.

190
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,310
当然
Oh, of course.

191
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,020
先设好相位仪  对吧
Set phasers to dumb, right?

192
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,420
赶紧  赶快  马上
Goodie, goodie, goodie!

193
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,420
这样不对  这样不对
This is wrong, this is wrong.

194
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,460
太兴奋了  可这样不对
I'm so excited, but this is wrong.

195
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,350
我要开封了
I'm going to do it.

196
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,270
我在开封了
I'm doing it.

197
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,020
开完了
I did it.

198
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,110
跟我想象中的1975年的味道一样
That's what I always thought 1975 smelled like.

199
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,550
斯科特  送我下去
One to beam down, Mr. Scott.

200
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,490
遵命  史波克
Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

201
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,070
启动
Energize.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,530
启动
Energize.

203
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,870
别坏啊
Don't be broken.

204
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,550
求求你  千万别坏
Oh, please, don't be broken.

205
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,790
瞧你让我干的好事
What did you make me do?!

206
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,770
冷静冷静  动动脑子
Okay, okay, think.

207
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,110
这样完全合乎常理
It's only logical.

208
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,150
天啊  这真是太好吃了
My goodness, that was delicious.

209
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,400
我希望你还吃得下巧克力软心蛋糕
Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.

210
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,020
不错嘛
Impressive.

211
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,240
你怎么想到做这个
What goes into making something like that?

212
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,860
其实呢  最开始
Well, you start out by trying to

213
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,780
我是想做巧克力酥的  结果失败了  我慌了
make chocolate souffl? And when it falls, you panic,

214
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,870
赶紧改个名字  当当  就变成软心蛋糕了
quickly change the name, and voila, lava cake.

215
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,860
我们的家长现在肯定很想知道进展如何
I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.

216
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,930
一起看看
Well, let's see.

217
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,280
没错  有三通未接电话
Yep, three missed calls.

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
四通未接电话  两条短信
Four missed calls, two text messages

219
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,420
一次视频聊天邀请失败  我赢了
and a failed video chat. I win!

220
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,490
那我们该怎么跟他们说呢
So, what are we going to tell them?

221
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,110
我觉得一切进展顺利
I'd like to tell them things are going well.

222
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
同意
Me, too.

223
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,780
但在燃起他们的希望之前
But before we get their hopes up,

224
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,840
得先弄清楚我们的步调是否一致
we should probably make sure we're on the same page.

225
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,420
好
Okay.

226
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,430
那你现在走到哪一步
What page are you on?

227
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,010
我现在走到  父母不断施压
I'm on the one where I'm under a lot of pressure

228
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,650
逼我结婚定下来
from my parents to get married and settle down

229
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,920
组建家庭
and have a family,

230
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,690
所以我会乖乖结婚  好隐瞒我是拉拉的事实
and I'm going to do it so they don't find out I'm gay.

231
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
你说什么
Say again?

232
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,990
我是拉拉
I'm gay.

233
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,800
好比男男
Like... dude-on-dude,

234
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,380
但你是女女吗
but with women?

235
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,990
我知道假结婚的只是一场骗局
I know a fake marriage isn't an honest way to live,

236
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,930
但你一定比其他人更理解  我们的文化中
but you of all people should know how difficult it is

237
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,760
出柜是多么难以被接受
to come out in our culture.

238
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,230
为什么我比其他人更理解
Why me of all people?!

239
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,440
你老家新德里那里有传言  说你...
Well, there's a rumor back in New Delhi that you're--

240
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
委婉点说好了
how shall we say--

241
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,860
身穿男服  心在纱丽
comfortable in a sari.

242
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,300
我不是基佬
I'm not gay!

243
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,690
真的吗  巧克力软心蛋糕
Really? The chocolate lava cake,

244
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,120
浴室的小肥皂
the little soaps in the bathroom,

245
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,060
而且  你身上的"香水"味比我还重呢
and I'm sorry, but you're wearing more perfume than I am.

246
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,060
那可是科勒和拉马尔的"固若金汤"
That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

247
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,430
顺便告诉你一下  这是中性香水
And for your information, it's unisex.

248
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,760
玩个填空游戏吧
Fill in the blank.

249
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,150
我爱夜生活
I love the nightlife...

250
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,460
我爱布"基"[舞蹈]
I like to boogie.

251
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,490
露馅了吧
Got you.

252
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,230
是跟女人跳  我爱跟女人跳布吉
With women! I like to boogie with women!

253
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
真让人失望
That's disappointing.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,380
你就是我想要的带"把儿"假老公
You were exactly the kind of phony-baloney husband

255
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,010
最完美的人选
I was looking for.

256
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,980
谢谢
Thank you.

257
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,710
重申一次  我的"把儿"喜欢女人
And once again, my baloney likes girls.

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,350
慢着
W-W-Wait!

259
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,150
在没尝过我自制的香堤伊奶油之前
You don't want to put a bite of that in your mouth

260
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,160
最好先一口都别吃
without trying my homemade Chantilly cream.

261
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,220
好吧  这次我听出来基味了
Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

262
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,200
天啊
Oh, dear.

263
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,780
两个太阳  没带防晒乳
Two suns and no sunscreen.

264
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,240
你好  谢尔顿
Hello again, Sheldon.

265
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,110
又怎么了  小小史波克
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

266
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,640
我对你非常失望
I am very disappointed in you.

267
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,300
你弄坏了自己的玩具  然后偷换给莱纳德
You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's.

268
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,620
你应该为自己的行为感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself.

269
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,940
是你让我玩玩具的
You're the one who told me to play with it.

270
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,540
那我让你从进取号的舰桥上跳下来
If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise,

271
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,800
你会照办吗
would you do it?

272
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,990
如果我上了进取号的舰桥
Oh, if I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,270
我死也不会跳出去
I would never, ever leave.

274
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,440
相信我  很快就会玩腻了
Trust me, it gets old after a while.

275
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
你必须改正你的错误  谢尔顿
You must right your wrongs, Sheldon.

276
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,910
为什么  我成功蒙混过关了
Why? I got away with it.

277
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,150
莱纳德有他的玩具  而且永远也不会打开
Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it,

278
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,540
所以不会知道那是坏的
so he won't know it's broken.

279
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,870
而我得到了一个完好无损的玩具
And I have a toy that isn't broken.

280
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,110
皆大欢喜
Everybody's happy.

281
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,020
错  我不开心
Well, I am unhappy.

282
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,760
我以为你是来自无情绪星球的呢
I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.
《星际迷航》史波克是人类与瓦肯人的混血
瓦肯人是个几乎能克制所有情感的种族

283
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,950
我来自台湾的一家玩具工厂
I come from a factory in Taiwan.

284
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
现在快去改正错误
Now, do the right thing.

285
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,910
知道你是什么吗
You know what you are?

286
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,530
瓦肯人有绿色的血液
你是个冷血的扫兴绿鬼
Well, you're a green-blooded buzz kill.

287
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,230
你现在还是赶紧传送走吧
Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.

288
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,140
好吧
Fine.

289
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,300
我用传送机把自己传送走吧
I will just use the transporter.

290
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,950
哎呀  我忘了
Oh, right.

291
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,750
你把它弄坏了
You broke it.

292
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
很好
Very well.

293
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,980
库珀呼叫进取号  请求传送一人
Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up.

294
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,850
开始传送
Energize.

295
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,060
小小史波克  救命啊
Tiny Spock, help.

296
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,860
要去吃午餐了吗
Ready for lunch?

297
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,180
要的  等一下
Yeah, one sec.

298
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,010
好了  我老妈要是发现
Oh, good. Ma would've killed me

299
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,250
我把牙保持器弄坏了会杀了我的
if she found out I broke my retainer.

300
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,200
我可以跟你谈个事情吗  跟拉希米有关
Can I run something by you? It's about Lakshmi.

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,300
好  说吧  发展得怎么样了
Yeah, sure. How are things going?

302
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,830
我们有几个小问题
We hit a couple of bumps.

303
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,230
她住在曼哈顿海滩
She lives over in Manhattan Beach,

304
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,290
我得花一个小时才能到她家
so it takes, like, an hour to get there.

305
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
而且她是个拉拉
And she's a lesbian.

306
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
你说她是"拉拉"是什么意思
What do you mean, "she's a lesbian"?

307
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,180
还记得每次我们去酒吧泡妞
Well, you know how whenever you and I would try

308
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,150
只要失败了  我们就会互相安慰
to hit on women in bars and they'd blow us off

309
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,770
说那女的铁定是同性恋吗
and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay?

310
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,950
就像那样啊
It's like that.

311
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,890
只是这次  她是真的同性恋
Except this time, it's true.

312
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,780
那她干嘛还出来跟你相亲啊
Then why did she even go out with you?

313
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,840
她想找个老公假结婚来掩盖事实
She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight.

314
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,680
虽然这主意
And, you know,

315
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,740
乍听之下挺疯狂的
it sounded crazy to me at first...

316
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,230
但我真的有考虑跟她结婚
but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

317
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,220
这事情乍听就很疯狂是因为
Okay, so the reason that might sound crazy...

318
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,710
这本来就很疯狂啊
is 'cause it's crazy!

319
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,030
霍华德  你有女朋友了
Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

320
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,750
你当然不用妥协
You know you have to make compromises.

321
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,440
但我要妥协的是  买哪种床单
Yes, but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy

322
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,460
或者今天该轮到谁洗衣服啦
or whose turn it is to do the laundry,

323
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,360
伯纳黛特还是我妈
Bernadette's or my mom's.

324
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,050
跟她结婚很合算啊
It's a great deal.

325
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,140
我和她都能摆脱父母的控制
We both get our parents off our backs,

326
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,670
每晚回家不用再面对空荡荡的屋子
I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night.

327
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,460
再说结了婚  我就尽情吃碳水化合物了
Plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again
据说不吃碳水化合物能减肥  控制身材

328
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,540
不用再担心身材问题
and let myself go.

329
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,400
何不告诉你父母
Why don't you tell your parents

330
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,770
你想另寻意中人
you want to try to find someone else?

331
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,120
或许找个睡过的女人比你少的伴儿
Maybe one who hasn't slept with more woman than you.

332
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,010
但这个女人想跟我结婚
Because this one wants to marry me.

333
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,210
我从没找到过想跟我结婚的女人
I might never find another one who does.

334
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,600
所以你真的是在慎重考虑
So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone

335
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,870
要过无性婚姻吗
you're never gonna have sex with?

336
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,550
不敢相信你是这态度
I can't believe your attitude.

337
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,530
你不是向来支持同性恋婚姻的吗
I thought you were in favor of gay people getting married.

338
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,260
没错  我支持的是双方都是同性恋
Yes, to other gay people!

339
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,760
你知道你这话有多"恐同"吗
Do you hear how homophobic you sound?

340
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,260
我才不想要坏的
Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

341
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,880
没事
Nothing!

342
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,950
什么
What?

343
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,660
没事  我说了没事
Nothing. I said nothing.

344
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,290
好诡异
That was weird.

345
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,390
真的吗  他的诡异早被我当正常了
Really? I don't even notice anymore.

346
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
我真不敢相信  你们真的不拆出来玩
I cannot believe you guys aren't gonna play with these.

347
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,140
我说了你不信嘛  全新未开封不能拆
Well, I told you, you don't. It's mint-in-box.

348
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,860
我不知道  只是觉得浪费
I don't know. I just think it's a waste.

349
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,320
放心啦  我只看看盒子
Relax. I'm just looking at the box.

350
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,060
你光用眼睛看就行了
Perhaps you should look with your eyes

351
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,060
把你那肌肉发达的汉子手拿开
and not your muscular Nebraska man hands.

352
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,150
你到底怎么回事啊
What is your problem?!

353
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,680
我就是怕你弄坏莱纳德的玩具
My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy.

354
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,410
万一你摇一摇  就摇坏了呢
Which you probably did by shaking it!

355
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,230
她摇过了  我们都看到了啊
She shook it, we all saw her.

356
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,880
莱纳德  我送你这个
Leonard, I bought you this

357
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,890
只是想让你玩得开心
'cause I wanted you to have fun with it.

358
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,040
我不想它一直呆在盒子里不见天日
I don't want it to sit in this box.

359
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,710
你说得对
You know, you're right.

360
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,120
这可是你送我的
I mean, it's from you,

361
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,780
我不可能拿出来卖
I'm never gonna sell it.

362
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,800
-我这就拆吧  -太好了
- I'm opening it. - Yes!

363
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,070
-是坏的  -什么
- It's broken. - What?

364
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,210
瞧你干的好事  汉子手
Oh, nice job, man hands!

365
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,760
不是我弄坏的
I didn't break it.

366
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,390
估计斯图尔特卖给我的时候就这样了
I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.

367
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,590
没错  肯定是他
Yes. Yes, he did.

368
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,020
这是最最最可信又最最最合理的解释...
That is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explana...

369
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,060
要怪就怪斯图尔特吧
Let's all be mad at Stuart!

370
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,750
这玩意老贵了
You know, I paid a lot for this.

371
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,060
我们拿回店里给他看吧
Let's take it over there and show him.

372
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,440
绝对要的
Absolutely.

373
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,460
等等
Wait!

374
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,330
是我干的
It was me.

375
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,130
是我拆开了你的玩具...
I opened your toy...

376
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,410
发现是坏的  却没有告诉你
discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.

377
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,120
你为什么要拆我的
Why would you open mine?

378
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,800
我没有  我说谎了
I didn't. That was a lie.

379
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,030
我拆开了自己的
I opened my own toy...

380
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,230
发现它已经坏了  所以跟你换了个
and it was already broken, so I switched them.

381
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,820
那你该跟斯图尔特说啊
You should talk to Stuart.

382
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,590
不能说  我又说谎了
I can't, because that was a lie.

383
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,370
你的玩具在地震中坏了...
Yours was broken in an earthquake--

384
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,610
还是说谎
and that's a lie.

385
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,160
真相到底是什么
What is the truth?

386
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,740
我的玩具史波克先生托梦给我
My Mr. Spock doll came to me in a dream

387
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,220
逼我拆开了盒子
and forced me to open it.

388
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,140
玩具坏掉以后  我就偷换了你的
And when the toy broke, I switched it for yours.

389
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,150
后来他鼓励我改正错误
Later, he encouraged me to do the right thing,

390
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,690
而我拒绝了他
and I defied him.

391
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,980
然后我就被葛恩追杀了
And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
葛恩:星际迷航中虚构的物种

392
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,550
好吧  这个我信
Okay, that I believe.

393
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,490
莱纳德  佩妮  我要对你们说
Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know

394
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,060
我很后悔之前对两位所做的事
that I regret my actions towards the two of you.

395
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,310
我又说谎了
That's a lie.

396
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,910
这么说  那个是我的咯
So, is that one mine?

397
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,860
-是的  -那给我吧  我来拆开
- Yes. - Well, hand it over so I can open it.

398
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,220
好吧
Okay.

399
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,530
莱纳德  虽然我的玩具坏了
And, Leonard, even though I don't have one anymore,

400
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,350
我还是希望你玩得开心
I hope you have fun playing with it.

401
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,030
-你又说谎了吧  -弥天大谎
- And that's a lie, right? - It's a big, fat whopper.

402
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,150
我真心希望这个是坏的
I hope it breaks.

403
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,740
欢迎大驾光临
This is a treat.

404
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,760
什么风把你们吹来了
What brings you guys by?

405
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,160
拉杰  华仔跟我说了你和拉希米的事
Raj, Howie told me what's going on with you and Lakshmi.

406
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,640
你居然告诉她了
You told her?

407
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,420
我还告诉所有人了呢
I told everybody.

408
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,300
我们相信你一定会找到一个真心爱你的人
We believe there's someone out there who will love you for you.

409
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,090
其实在这点上  我们各持不同意见
Actually, we kind of agreed to disagree on that one,

410
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,480
但我们一致认为  你不该跟她结婚
but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.

411
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,360
所以当我在等待这个可能存在  也可能不存在的
So, while I'm waiting for this mysterious perfect match

412
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,750
神秘真命天女时  就该一直单身下去吗
who may or may not exist, I'm supposed to just be alone?

413
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,500
那倒未必
Not necessarily.

414
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,700
我们为你找了个可以相依偎的伴
I think we found someone for you to cuddle with.

415
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,370
我的老天
Oh, my goodness.

416
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,590
你可真是史上最可爱的小狗狗
Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever!

417
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,260
他真的是送我的吗
You got him for me?

418
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,220
是"她"  你俩肯定合得来
Her. We thought you two would hit it off.

419
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,310
我俩一拍即合
I think we already have.

420
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,500
太感谢你们了
Thank you guys so much.

421
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,590
一般男用钱包称wallet  女用钱包称purse
来看看你能不能装进我男用手包里去
Let's go see if you fit in my man purse.

422
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,400
异性恋  骗谁呀
Heterosexual, my ass.
