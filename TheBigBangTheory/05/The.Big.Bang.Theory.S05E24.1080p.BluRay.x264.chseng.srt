《生活大爆炸》  前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,510
有谁会在做爱的时候说这样的话啊
Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?!

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,620
我不知道  高潮时刻  情不自禁嘛
I don't know. It was the heat of the moment!

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,210
放屁  高潮时刻应该是说
No, the heat of the moment is

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,550
"对  太爽了"
"Ooh, yeah, just like that."

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,410
而不是说"你愿意嫁给我吗"
Not, "Will you marry me?"

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,080
可航空航天局很想把我的望远镜装上太空站
NASA really wants my telescope up on the Space Station,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,070
所以他们要让我提前升空
so they're putting me on an earlier launch.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,140
什么时候
When?

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,240
下周五
A week from Friday.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,940
什么  可咱们的婚礼就在那个周日呀
What? We're getting married that Sunday.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,540
说的没错
You're right.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,670
我不能去太空
I can't go to space.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,010
我要结婚
I have to get married.

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,010
这个理由没人能反驳
No one can say that's not a good reason.

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,160
我这就打回给他
I'll call them back.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,550
等你回来咱们再举办婚礼
We'll have the wedding when you get back.

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,200
你爸会气疯的
Your dad's going to be furious.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,840
他不可能会同意我们延迟婚礼
There's no way he's going to let us postpone this wedding.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,150
至少咱们努力过
Well, we tried.

21
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,200
我去跟他谈
I'll talk to him.

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,010
他不会拒绝他的宝贝女儿的
He won't say no to his little girl.

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
不  应该我去跟他谈
No! I, uh, I should talk to him.

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,130
来场男人跟男人间的对话
Man to man.

25
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,940
好吧  我跟你说老实话
All right, look, I'm going to level with you.

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,480
我很害怕进入太空
I'm terrified about going into space.

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,590
要是我回不来怎么办
You know, what if I don't make it back?

28
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,850
会没事的  女婿
It's going to be okay, son.

29
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,930
你真的这么想吗
You really think so?

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,770
当然
Of course.

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,780
伯纳黛特那么漂亮
A pretty girl like Bernadette,

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,210
肯定会找到新归宿
she'll find a new guy.

33
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,940
时至今日...

34
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,220

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,890

迈克
Hey, Mike?

37
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,760
什么事
Yeah...

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,730
我改变主意  不想去了
I changed my mind. I don't want to do this.

39
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,760
这个好笑
Good one.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,600
没错  我向来幽默
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,170
我还准备了个歇斯底里的段子稍后用
I also have a hysterical bit planned for later

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,700
整个发射过程我就狂哭给逗你们玩
where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,270
谢尔顿  NASA电视台是哪个频道
Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?

44
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,030
289台  位于288的游戏节目网络

The uterus quivers, does it not?

我实在看不下去了
I don't think I can watch.

只能穿我的发福裤了

太震撼了  在半小时后
Remarkable. In just under a half hour,

60

霍华德屁股的正下方将有200公吨燃料被

开始进入倒计时啦
Okay, we're in the final countdown.

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,630
你还行吧
How you doing over there?

70
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,360
很好  很好
Good! Good!

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,870
先问一下  简报当时说
Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing.

72
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,600
这身制服能容纳多少尿来着

完毕
Check.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,250
果麦圈有个很基的广告
}因此被人拿来形容基
他叫你果麦圈客  是因为你那基友发型吗
He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,220
不  是因为我跟妈妈住
No, it's... 'cause I live with my mom

78
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,390
她有帮我弄水果麦圈早餐
and she makes me Froot Loops.

79
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,140
还是用你很基的原因吧  那个比较好接受
Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,440
其实
Actually,

You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?

85
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,230
还没有  两位不介意的话
Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind,

86
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,570
我真的不打算聊天了
I'm not really up for chatting.

87
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,070
我只想静静坐在这里
I'm just going to sit here quietly

88
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,380
让我的人生在眼前一一闪现
and let my life flash before my eyes.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,060
闪现得太快了  我再试一遍
That went really quick. Let me try it again.

90
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,130
闭上眼睛  伸出手来
Close your eyes. Put out your hand.

91
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,820
我有礼物要送你
I got you something special.

92

拜托  霍华德  我不会再上当了
Come on, Howard. I'm not falling for that again.

93
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,840

94
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,040

帮我戴上
Put it on me.

98
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,940
好的  但我一会还要收回来
Okay, but I'm going to have to get it back for you

99
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,660
回头带到太空站里去
so I can take it to the International Space Station.

100
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,270
那样的话  等我回家
That way, when I come home,

101
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,250
你就能拥有一颗上过太空的星
you will have a star that was actually in space.

102
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,060
天啊
Oh... my God.

103
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,280
接招吧  送过你礼物的弱爆男人们
Take that, every guy who's ever bought you anything.

104
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,050
这是我收到的最棒的礼物
This is the most amazing gift I've ever gotten.

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,440
真的吗  你真这么喜欢的话
Really? Well, if you like it that much,

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,130
闭上眼睛  伸出手来
then close your eyes and put out your hand.

107
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,620
我要去超市给你买路上吃的零食
I'm going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip!

108
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,830
要我帮你买上你最喜欢的
Do you want me to get those little boxes of

109
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,820
水果麦圈吗
Froot Loops you like?!

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,650
不要  我吃水果麦圈的时候
No! When I eat Froot Loops,

111
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,970
别的宇航员都取笑我
the other astronauts make fun of me!

112
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
霍华德  我不想等到
Howard, I don't want to wait until

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
你回来再结婚
you're back to get married.

114
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
什么
What?

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,230
我想在你还没上火箭前就嫁给你
I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.

116
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,960
但我过两天就要走了
But I'm leaving in two days.

117
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,210
谷物麦片要买吗
What about Apple Jacks?!

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,450
我不用自备麦片粥好吗
I don't need to take cereal!

119
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,030
你以为你在俄罗斯
What kind of breakfast do you think

120
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,300
他们会给你什么早饭吃啊
they're going to give you in Russia?!

121
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,820
他们发明了薄卷饼  饿不死我的
They invented blintzes! I'll be fine!

122
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,250
灯泡还是在纽泽西发明的呢
They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey!

123
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,310
去纽泽西也不会有人送你灯泡啊
It doesn't mean they hand them out to you when you go!

124
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,960
我们就跟朋友们办个小仪式就好了
We'll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends,

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,060
等你回来了  还是可以再办盛大婚礼的
we'll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.

126
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,400
好呀  我们结婚吧
Okay. Let's get married.

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
这样吧  给你买个高纤维的
You know what, I'll buy you All-Bran

128
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,290
免得你到时候在太空便秘
in case you get stopped up in outer space.

129
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,010
总之  我们决定今天下午
So anyway, we decided to go down to

去市政厅领证

132
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,910
-好啊  -太好了

133
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,340
我们知道这是临时通知  但还是希望
I mean, we know it's short notice, but we'd love you all

134
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,320
-大家都能出席  -不行不行不行
- to come with us. - No, no, no,

135
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,550
这不是我想要的婚礼
this is not the wedding I wanted!

136
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,160
我要的是我穿着伴娘礼服
I want to wear my maid of honor dress

137
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
在万众瞩目下  步上红毯
and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me,

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,940
弦乐四重奏演奏着《今晚的你如此美丽》
while a string quartet plays "The way you look tonight."

139
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,770
我们没有要用这首歌啊
That wasn't going to be our processional music.

140
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,330
但我要用啊
Well, it was going to be mine!

141
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,070
谢谢你们的邀请  但我不去了
Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline

142
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,680
因为感觉挺没意思的
because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.

143
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,650
别这样  谢尔顿  会很有意思的
Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.

144
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,200
烂片《绿灯侠》你也说过有意思啊
That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie.

145
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,070
你大错特错了足足114分钟
You were 114 minutes of wrong.

146
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,170
艾米  你的答案呢
So, what do you say, Amy?

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,300
我能穿伴娘礼服去吗
Can I wear my maid of honor dress?

148
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,410
拜托  你真想穿着那身衣服去市政厅啊
Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?

149
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,720
我就剩这点指望了  连这你也要夺走吗
It's all I have left! You're going to take that from me, too?!

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,920
-艾米  你真漂亮  -我知道
- Amy, you look great. - I know.

151
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,260
你上哪弄的啤酒
Where'd you get a beer?

152
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,220
从那边有纹身的小俩口那弄的
From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos.

153
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,720
可歌可泣啊  他们身处对立的贩毒团伙
Beautiful story: they're in rival drug gangs,

154
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,550
却要冒险来结婚
and they're getting married.

155
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,390
嘘  别让其他人知道
Shh, no one can know.

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,900
看看这些恋爱中的人
Look at all these people in love.

157
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,850
总会让你不禁思考  对吧
It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?

158
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,690
没错  确实
It does, indeed.

159
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,570
莱纳德
Leonard...

160
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,190
鉴于你最近向佩妮求婚了
is it awkward being here with Penny given that

161
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,270
跟她一起来是不是很尴尬
you recently proposed to her?

162
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,980
你向佩妮求婚了吗
You proposed to Penny?

163
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,970
我不想讨论这件事
I don't want to talk about it.

164
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,230
他在哪求婚的
Where did he pop the question?

165
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,080
你怎么回答
What did you say?

166
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,430
她不答应  能打住了么
She said, "no." Can we drop it now?

167
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,980
那不算正式的求婚
It wasn't a real proposal.

168
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,550
为什么不算正式求婚
Why wasn't it a real proposal?

169
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,320
他在交媾的时候问的
He asked her during coitus.

170
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,700
你有单膝下跪吗  还是本来就这姿势了
Did you get down on one knee or where you already there?

171
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,510
霍华德  婚礼的日子别这么说话
Howard, don't talk like that on your wedding day.

172
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,970
我错了  妈...  马...
Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.

173
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,870
我"马"上收声  我的伯纳黛特
Ma... Burna... You're ma Bernadette.

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,940
多亏你告诉了谢尔顿
Good move telling Sheldon.

175
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,510
怎么  不许我求婚  也不许我跟朋友说吗
What, I can't propose? I can't talk to my friends?

176
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,850
还有什么事是我不许做的啊
Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?

177
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,410
够了  别吵了
All right, that's enough.

178
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,210
今天的主角不是你们俩
Today is not about you two.

179
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,400
今天的主角是霍华德和伯纳黛特
Today is about Howard and Bernadette

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,650
还有我
and me.

181
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,230
各位请注意
Folks, can I have your attention.

182
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,340
现在已经五点了
It's five 0'clock ,

183
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,710
我们只能再注册三对新人
we're going to be able to take three more couples.

184
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,160
其他的人星期一再过来吧
The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.

185
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,450
不是吧
Oh, no.

186
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,810
交给我
I got this.

187
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,040
不好意思
Excuse me?

188
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,510
能不能通融一下  让我们先注册
But is there any way you could squeeze us in?

189
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,520
其实  我是一名宇航员
See, I'm an astronaut and

190
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,330
我周日就要去俄罗斯
I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so

191
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,740
乘坐联盟号火箭上国际空间站了
I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.

192
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,480
我也是呢  到时候见
Yeah, me, too. I'll see you there.

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,830
我不敢相信我们结不成婚了
I can't believe we're not going to get married.

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,530
失陪一下  我过去看看
Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple

195
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,320
排在前面的新人需不需要伴娘
at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.

196
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,520
我跟我老婆说
So, I tell my wife,

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,720
"买狗  或者不买狗
"get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it,

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,310
我就在这里  我就不遛狗  不喂不清"
I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."

199
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,610
遛狗就是祸  是祸躲不过
You know you're going to wind up walking it.

200
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,950
我知道
I know.

201
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,520
你们不是该说些太空的事吗
Uh, shouldn't you guys be talking about

202
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,240
怎么说起狗来了
space stuff instead of dogs?

203
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,430
迪米特里
Dimitri,

204
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,530
果麦圈客说  我们谈谈
Froot Loops would be more comfortable

205
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,910
太空的事他会比较舒坦
if we talked about space stuff.

206
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,450
行啊
Okay,

207
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,030
我要去太空了
I'm going into space,

208
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,150
回来后  老子还得去捡狗屎
and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.

209
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,640
这样好点没
Is that better?

210
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,750
谢你们全家啊
Thanks.

211
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,230
其实我们可以开车去拉斯维加斯结婚啊
You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.

212
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,540
那也太俗气老套了吧
No, it's that kind of tacky?

213
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,960
我就认识很多在那里结婚的人呢
Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.

214
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,660
有到现在还没离婚的吗
Are any of them still married?

215
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,640
有啊  配偶不是同一个罢了
Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but...

216
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,560
天下之大  一定有能让我们结婚的特别之地
There's got to be some place special we could do it.

217
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,530
莱纳德  你以前想象在哪跟佩妮结婚呢
Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?

218
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,050
你别哪壶不开提哪壶
Will you shut up?

219
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,660
我知道怎么办比较特别
Well, I know how to make it special.

220
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,350
我说过我们不模仿《音乐之声》
I told you we are not recreating the wedding
音乐之声  舞台剧/电影

221
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,010
里面的婚礼
from The Sound of Music.

222
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,530
我知道  你早残忍地跟我挑明了
Yes, you made that brutally clear to me.

223
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,270
我想建议的是
What I was going to suggest is

224
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,920
如果你们愿意等到星期天早上结婚
if that you're willing to wait until Sunday morning,

225
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,640
谷歌的卫星会经过帕萨迪纳上空
the Google satellite will be over Pasadena.

226
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,790
卫星将会从太空拍下你们婚礼的照片
You can have your wedding photographed from space.

227
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,580
哇  酷毙了
Oh... That's so cool.

228
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,570
-挺有想法的嘛  拉杰  -我一直说
- Oh, way to go, Raj. - I keep telling you,

229
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,080
如果我没去当天体物理学家
if I wasn't an astrophysicist,

230
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,980
肯定会去当派对策划人
I would have been a party planner.

231
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,330
凡事都有两面性嘛
It was always a coin flip.

232
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,130
好  仪式的时间定在周日早上
Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning.

233
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,090
现在得找一个卫星照得到我们的好位置
Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.

234
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,780
我们屋顶如何
How about our roof?

235
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,230
-我喜欢  -不错
- Oh, I like that. - That's great.

236
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,660
天啊  真不敢相信我的伴娘服
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honor dress

237
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,680
要上谷歌地球的空照图了
is going to be on Google Earth.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,330
地点和时间已经有了
So, we have the where and the when,

239
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,620
就差婚礼的证婚人了
but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.

240
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,100
那简单  谁都可以上网
Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online

241
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,590
受任当证婚牧师
and get ordained as a minister.

242
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,670
我知道一家刺青穿洞店  只要100块
I know a piercing parlor, where, for a hundred bucks,

243
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,030
他们就帮你证婚  你送你免费穿洞
they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring

244
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,670
想把婚戒穿入哪部位都行
through any body part you want.

245
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,950
不错  那谁来当证婚人呢
Great, well, who's it going to be?

246
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,060
我来吧
I'll do it,

247
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,750
前提是得让用克林贡语主持仪式
provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.

248
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,600
没门儿
No.

249
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,290
你是看上她哪点啊
What do you see in her?

250
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,000
指挥中心  请再说一次 漏的速度有多快

251
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,590
漏  什么漏了
Leaking? What's leaking?

252
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,300
当然是燃料啊  安静
Fuel. Shh.

253
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,540
还行

254
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,150
应该可以照常发射

255
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,380
收到  谢谢指挥中心

256
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,980
燃料在泄漏  我们还要照常发射啊
There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?

257
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,420
别吓掉你的"圈子"[戒指]哦  果麦圈客
Don't lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.

258
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,160
这事经常发生
This happens a lot.

259
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,630
十次有九次都屁事没有
Nine times out of ten, no problem.

260
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,200
那第十次呢
What happens on the tenth time?

261
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
身后事
Problem.

262
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,160
伙计们  趁我还记得
Hey, guys, before I forget,

263
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,510
我给你们准备了伴郎小谢礼
I got you a little groomsman present.

264
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,890
-谢谢  -你太客气了
- Oh, thanks, man. - You didn't have to do that.

265
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,100
《神奇四侠》  1965年第三册
Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965,

266
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,640

267
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,520
就是神奇先生和隐形女侠结婚的那集
The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.

268
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,870
哎哟喂
Oh, dear.

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,450
-我就害怕这样  -哪样
- I was afraid of this. - What?

270
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,330
虽然是很有心思的礼物
While a thoughtful gift,

271
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,280
但状态良好的这本漫画
this comic book in this condition

272
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,570
现在至少值100块钱呢
is worth at least a hundred dollars.

273
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,670
是啊  然后呢
Yeah, so?

274
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,780
我送给你和贝纳黛特的船形调味壶才88块
I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth $88.

275
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,940
这样就变成我欠你了
Which places me in your debt

276
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,910
而我不想欠你
and I can't be in your debt

277
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,010
因为哪天你可能会让我帮忙搬家
because someday you might ask me to help you move...

278
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,570
...或帮你去杀人
...or to kill a man.

279
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,990
想杀人也不会找你帮吧
I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

280
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,430
万一他没得选了呢
Well, what if it's his only way out?

281
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,430
我不能冒这个险
I can't risk it.

282
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,850
这里是12块
Here is $12.

283
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,070
现在不拖不欠了
Now, we're even.

284
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,790
慢着
Wait...

285
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,910
我还有送卡片  退我2块钱
I bought a card. Give me two dollars.

286
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,100
所以我说嘛  我最讨厌送礼了
And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.

287
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,800
谁呀
Who is it?

288
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,250
新郎
It's the groom.

289
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,620
你不能进来  婚前见新娘会倒霉的
You can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.

290
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,240
好吧
Okay, uh, fine.

291
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,660
妮妮  我得去接我妈
Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!

292
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,280
马上就回来
I'll be right back!

293
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
她为什么不能自己开车过来
Why can't she drive herself?!

294
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,440
她不想坐皱她的裙子
She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it

295
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,630
得让她平躺在小面包车后座才能载过来
so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbor's van!

296
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
好吧  快去快回
All right, just hurry!

297
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,700
收到  妈...  马...
Okay, I'll see you later, Ma... uh...

298
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,460
"马"上见哦  准新娘
lovely bride-to-be.

299
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,060
我真得好好注意下了
I really got to watch that.

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,310
快点  拉杰  可以开始了
Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

301
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,780
什么  可不可以
What, we're ready,

302
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
得我说了才算
when I say we're ready.

303
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,870
好了  现在可以开始了
Okay, now we're ready.

304
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,150
妈  不坐过来怎么看得到啊
Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?!

305
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,940
坐这儿就挺好
I'm fine where I am!

306
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,180
我可不想从屋顶上摔下去
I don't want to fall off the roof!

307
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,880
在你摔下去前  屋顶早被你压穿了
You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.

308
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,580
佩妮
Penny.

309
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,700
你的新婆婆是个狠角色啊
Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.

310
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,120
老爸  稍后再谈
Not now, Dad.

311
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,020
她的胡子比我的还"雄壮威武"
She's got a bigger mustache than me.

312
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,650
上吧  少年
Here you go.

313
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,140
什么"上吧  少年"  我又不是橄榄球
"Here you go"? What am I, a football?

314
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,170
他这废柴要真能接到橄榄球就好了
Like that guy could catch a football.

315
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,740
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard and Bernadette,

316
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,540
今天我们作为你们的朋友兼牧师
the five of us stand before you as your friends

317
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,730
站在你们的面前
and newly ordained ministers.

318
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,400
大声点
Louder!

319
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,300
他们都有牧师资格  要一起给我们证婚
They all got ordained, they're all marrying us,

320
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,270
场面超有爱
it's adorable!

321
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,760
欲知详情  滚过来听
If you want to hear it, come closer!

322
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,420
两位  当我看到你们
Guys, when I look at the two of you

323
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,290
即将开始共度的人生旅程时  我心...
starting your lives together, it fills... my heart...

324
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,240
我心充满...
It fills my... heart...

325
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,570
我需要点时间平复一下
Okay, I'm going to need a minute.

326
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,510
还是我来致辞吧
Okay, I'll, I'll go.

327
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,000
霍华德与伯纳黛特  我知道
Howard and Bernadette, I know you two

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,760
这与你们计划的美妙婚宴大相径庭
planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding,

329
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,820
但只要彼此相爱
but when you're in love,

330
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,680
人间处处能成婚  形式不过锦上添花
it doesn't matter where or how these things happen.

331
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,350
因为拥有对方  便拥有全世界
It just matters that you have each other.

332
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,360
有意见吗
Problem?

333
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,300
没有
No.

334
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,450
我想牧师霍夫斯塔特是在讽刺
I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection

335
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,650
你对爱情的看法以及
between your statement about love and your rejection

336
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,680
在你房里求婚被拒的事
of his proposal in the bedroom.

337
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,120
-少幼稚了你  -话又不是我说的
- Oh, grow up. - Hey, I didn't say it.

338
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,080
够了  你们两个都收声
All right, that's enough from the both of you.

339
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,910
他先挑事的
Well, he started it!

340
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,140
那我息事可以了吧
Well, I'm ending it!

341
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,960
伯纳黛特  我想感谢你
Bernadette, I want to thank you

342
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
给我当你伴娘的机会
for allowing me to be your maid of honor.

343
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,160
我也想告诉你
I also want you to know,

344
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,990
如果你们以离婚告终
that I will be happy to do it again

345
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,920
我也愿再当你的伴娘
if this marriage craps out.

346
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,730
谢谢致辞  艾米
Thank you, Amy.

347
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,550
"感人肺腑"啊
Very touching.

348
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,190
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard and Bernadette,

349
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,610
能与最好的朋友彼此相爱  实乃三生有幸
you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other.

350
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,950
这样的爱  情比金坚
And that's the strongest kind of love

351
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,580
因为你们的爱  充满着善意
because at its core, it has kindness,

352
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,110
耐心与尊重
patience, and respect.

353
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,100
这些优点在"某些人"身上偏寻不得啊
Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.

354
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,360
要来点芦荟修复精华吗
Would you like some aloe vera?

355
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,470
你被人虐得体无完肤啊
You just got burned.

356
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,200
好啦  轮到我了
All right, my turn.

357
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,790
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard, Bernadette...

358
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,710
[克林贡语]

359
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,410
谢尔顿  说了不许用克林贡语
Sheldon! I told you no Klingon!

360
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,380
好吧  我用英语说
Fine, I'll do it in English,

361
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,170
但祝辞会略失风味
but it loses something.

362
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,200
人穷尽一生追寻另一个人类
The need to find another human being

363
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,980
共度一生的事
to share one's life with,

364
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,870
我一直无法理解
has always puzzled me.

365
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,570
或许我自己太有意思  无需他人陪伴
Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself.

366
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,500
所以  我祝你们在对方身上得到的快乐
With that being said, may you find as much happiness

367
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,680
与我给自己的一样多
with each other as I find on my own.

368
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,820
克林贡版本绝对能让你们痛哭流涕
The Klingon would have made you cry.

369
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,860
你们两个准备了婚誓吧
I believe you two have prepared vows?

370
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,540
霍华德·约尔·沃罗威茨
Howard Joel Wolowitz,

371
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,860
我的婚誓如同你  短小但美妙
like you, this is going to be short and sweet.

372
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,870
我全心全意  从灵魂深处爱着你
I love you with all my heart and soul

373
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,320
我愿一生一世  与你永不分离
and promise to be with you forever.

374
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,910
伯纳黛特·玛丽安·罗斯滕科斯基
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

375
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,550
大声点
Speak up!

376
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,590
喂  现在起
Hey, from now on,

377
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,730
能吼我的女人只有她一个
she's the only women who can yell at me!

378
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,510
遇到你之前
Until I met you,

379
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,330
一生一爱
I couldn't imagine

380
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,620
共度一生对我如同天方夜谭
spending my life with just one person...

381
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,760
而现在
...and now I can't imagine

382
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,550
分离一刻  便有如生离死别
spending one day of it without you.

383
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,280
以我们被加利福尼亚州所赋予的权利
By the power vested in us, by the state of California...

384
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,130
与克林贡最高议会
and the Klingon High Council...

385
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,290
我们现在宣布你们成为夫妻
...we now pronounce you husband and wife.

386
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,810
开始点火了
That's ignition.

387
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,680
我爱死这部分了
I love this part!

388
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,310
我也爱
Me, too!

389
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,430
我内心五味杂陈啊
I have strongly mixed feelings!

390
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,100
天啊  要开始了
Oh, my God, it's happening.

391
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,150
我错过了吗
Did I miss it?

392
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,720
没  快来看
No, come on in. Hurry.

393
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,820
他是我的挚爱
I love that man.

394
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,350
也是我的
Me, too.

395
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,300
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

396
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,860
之前我心里总是对这事有小小的怀疑
This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.

397
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,730
时刻已到
This is it.

398
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,100
勇往直前吧  霍华德·沃罗威茨
Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.

399
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,700
亲娘咧
NOy vay...!
