1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,020
然后让反质子的自旋反向
And reverse the spin on the antiproton...

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,670
γ变成了α
and γ becomes α...

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,620
乘以矩阵(-i,0)
Multiplied by a matrix of (-i,0)...

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,010
有成果了
And there we have it.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,310
证明我九点过后就是一条废柴的证据
Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after 9 o'clock.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,150
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,450
好了  好了
All right, all right.

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,280
我看穿了你们的诡计
I see what's going on.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,920
万圣节前的装神弄鬼罢了
A little pre-Halloween hijinkery.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,160
阴森的呜咽
A ghostly moan,

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,230
铁链的响声
a rattling of chains,

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,230
女巫的奸笑
a witch's cackle.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,070
老套的鬼屋三元素
The trifecta of haunted house cliche.

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,140
普通人尖叫  哥只想睡觉
Instead of "eek," I say, "yawn."

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,150
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,120
滴血之墙
Oh, the walls are dripping blood,

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,320
看上去假得就像把碳酸钠溶液
which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator
碳酸钠溶液呈碱性  遇酚酞变红

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,360
滴进了酚酞里一样
exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,680
"我们地狱里见谢尔顿"
"See you in hell Sheldon."

21
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,290
这话最恐怖的地方  是你忘了加逗号了
The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.

22
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,940
好  很好
Okay, all right.

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,280
这招高
That one was clever.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,810
缆绳上挂着个含磷的骨架
Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line.

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,550
现身吧  快活的恶作剧者们[也是乐队名]
Come on out, merry pranksters.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,620
该谢幕了
Take a bow.

27
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,390
你真该看看你刚才的表情
You should've seen your face.

28
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,160
有什么呀  不过就是稍稍受到惊吓
Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
然后瞳孔小小地放大了一点
of mildly startled.

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,790
你就承认吧  谢尔顿
Come on, admit it.

31
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,960
我们吓着你了
We got you, Sheldon.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,720
拜托  惊吓惊吓  有惊才有吓
Please, fright depends on an element of surprise.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,060
而事实是
The simple fact is,

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,070
在能未卜先知的我面前
because I am much smarter than you,

35
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,300
你们两个臭皮匠的烂招  只是笑话
and able to anticipate your actions,

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,860
想吓到我诸葛亮
it is highly unlikely that you two rubes

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,880
门都没有
could ever surprise me.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,880
他说的对吧
He's probably right.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,700
我们吓不倒他  他太聪明了
We can't beat him. He's just too smart.

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,760
先生们
Gentlemen.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,430
谁刚才赌他会晕倒来着
Who had money on "faints"?

42
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,580
我赌的是尿裤子
I had "pee his pants."

43
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,820
等等
Hang on.

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,010
看来我们都赌中了
Looks like everyone's a winner.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
生活大爆炸第五季第七集

46
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,970
当心了  谢尔顿
Oh. Watch out, Sheldon.

47
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,810
这个《鬼马小精灵》可是个鬼-鬼-鬼-鬼啊
This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!

48
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,970
可笑
Droll.

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,810
那也可笑不过一个成年人
Not as droll as a grown man

50
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,010
晕倒在自己的一滩尿上
passed out in a puddle of his own urine.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,050
的确太可笑了
That was pretty droll.

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,880
尿液中含氨
笑声中还带着一丝氨气的芬芳
With a hint of ammonia.

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,010
接着沾沾自喜着吓人的胜果吧  先生们
Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen.

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,750
觉得自己吓倒了一名胆小的大学学者
You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic.

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,350
可你们忘了一件事
Well, you've forgotten one thing:

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,720
我可是孤星州[德州别称]之子
I am also a son of the Lone Star state.

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,890
我可是彻头彻尾的德州人
I'm Texas through and through.

58
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,640
我们可会修理人了
And we know how to settle scores down there.

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,310
不信就去问  常被我们修理的墨西哥人
If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,260
辣妹出没  九点钟方向
Hot girl, nine o'clock.

61
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,400
别同时抬头看人家
Don't everybody look at once!

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,210
她来漫画书店做什么
What is she doing in a comic book store?

63
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,090
我不清楚  估计是迷路了
I don't know, she might be lost.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,800
无所谓了  都学着点儿
Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

65
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,760
-你好啊  -你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

66
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,820
呃...呃...呃
... it-it-it...

67
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,070
都闭嘴
Shut up.

68
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,700
你要买这期《Next Men》吗
Are you getting this Next Men?

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,600
是的  这是第二十一期的那本
Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21.

70
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,810
地狱男爵第一次登场的那期
First appearance of Hellboy.

71
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,540
我知道  我找了它很多年
I know. I've been looking for it for years.

72
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,610
-抱歉了  -要是我假装来泡你
- Sorry.  - Hey, if I pretended to hit on you,

73
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,510
我的美貌够不够让你分心  好让我把书偷走
could I distract you enough to sneak it away?

74
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,090
够的  但滥用超能美貌做坏事是不对的
Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.

75
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,820
该死  我在氪星的老爸禁止我用能力使坏
Damn, I'm forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so.
Kryptonian  超人家族所在星系

76
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,330
我叫爱丽丝
I'm Alice.

77
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,690
我叫莱纳德
Leonard.

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,430
你真可爱  莱纳德
You're very cute, Leonard.

79
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,100
谢谢  你也是
Thanks. You, too.

80
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
这书你拿去吧
You know, go ahead and take it.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,200
不  不行  这样我就做坏事了
No, no. No, no, I-I did evil.

82
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,070
你接受以物易物吗
Would you be open to a trade?

83
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,840
可以  没问题
Yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,210
好吧  给
Okay. Here.

85
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,410
这是我的电话号码
This is my number.

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
记得打给我
Call me.

87
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,350
抱歉  手掌有点出汗
Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

88
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,580
那是个什么词儿呀
What's that word?

89
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,620
-爱丽丝  -对哦  你的名字
- Alice.  - Oh, right, your name.

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,990
刚看成"爱鸡鸡"还纳闷呢
That makes more sense than "Penis".

91
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,680
回见了
Later.

92
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,290
我们亲眼目睹到你在漫画店成功把到妹吗
Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?

93
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,360
如果是真的  我要把你的肖像
'Cause if you did, you get your picture up there

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,230
挂在英雄榜上
on the Wall of Heroes.

95
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,640
没有吧  应该没有把到她
No, I don't think I picked her up.

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,620
更何况我还有家室呢
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,770
无所谓  你算是最成功的一个了
Doesn't matter. This is the closest anyone's ever come.

98
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,710
你入榜了  伙计
You're going on the wall, my friend.

99
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,610
一定要开信箱
Be sure to check the mail.

100
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,190
你还要提醒我几次呀
How many times are you gonna tell me?

101
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,990
-你没事吧  -没事
- What's with you? - Nothing.

102
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,880
我锲而不舍有什么奇怪的
It's not suspicious that I'm fixating.

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,810
我个性向来坚持不懈
It's consistent with my personality.

104
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,070
好吧
Right.

105
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,720
伙计们
Hey, guys.

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,920
又买万圣节糖果了啊
More Halloween candy?

107
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,330
你昨天不是刚买了一堆吗
Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?

108
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,750
那堆啊  吃完了
Oh. Yeah. That's gone.

109
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,620
万圣节和大姨妈一起来
It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS

110
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,600
我是屋漏偏逢连夜雨呀
hit at the same time.

111
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,060
莱纳德没时间聊天
Leonard doesn't have time to chat,

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,120
他要去开信箱
he has to get the mail.

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,710
你就不能消停会吗  我马上就开
Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute.

114
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,820
-你工作怎么样了  -快开信箱
- How was work?  - Open the mail!

115
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,310
等我一下
Excuse me.

116
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,730
几份广告而已  没什么重要的东西
A couple of circulars, nothing important.

117
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,420
-他怎么了  -等着瞧
- What's with him? - Hang on.

118
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,580
你是德州人又怎样  哥还是新泽西人呢
You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,140
看这个
Check it out.

动漫展嘛  你懂的

Wow, you must have gotten so laid.

125
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,970
没有  但洁西卡·阿尔芭有揉我毛毛的肚子
No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,570
要看看我画的漫画吗
Want to see a comic I draw?

127
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,650
开玩笑吧  你自己有画漫画啊
You're kidding. You have your own book?

128
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,160
是的  灵感是来自我的生活
Yeah. It's kinda based on my life.

Oh, look. That's you having sex with a guy

131
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,140
楚巴卡 星战人物  浑身毛茸茸  像猩猩
楚巴卡模样的人在嘿咻
in the top half of a Chewbacca costume.

132
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,210
在动漫展上吗
Comic Con?

133
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,370
你以为是  不过非也
You'd think, but no.

134
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,330
你真有才  画得真好
You're very talented. This is really good.

135
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,900
你是不是...
Did you do...

136
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,840
我能用我的漫画换你的《地狱男爵》吗
So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,290
换我车子都行
You can have my car.

138
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,400
神啊
Oh, dear.

139
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,080
我的老天爷啊
Oh, dear...

140
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,010
妈啊  妈啊  妈啊
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear...

141
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,370
救命啊  救命啊  救命啊
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

142
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,110
洗手液  洗手液  洗手液  洗手液
Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.

143
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,540
早上好  谢尔顿
Good morning, Sheldon.

144
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,640
今早是好啊
It is, isn't it?

145
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,020
哎呀  讨厌
Oh, bother.

146
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,000
每次都这样
Isn't that just always the way?

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,730
要用订书机  才发现没钉书针了
You go to staple something, and you're out of staples.

148
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,940
老天  要是我早些在史泰博的时候
Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today
史泰博:  美国著名办公用品品牌  与订书针同字

149
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,630
知道就好了
when I was at Staples.

150
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,860
那里有回形针啊
You ever think of paper clips right there?

151
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,430
不  我需要能把纸钉牢的东西
No, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers.

152
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,410
你不是把订书钉放在第一格抽屉的吗
Say, don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer?

153
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,170
不知道  也许吧
I don't know. Maybe.

154
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,270
行行好  看一下嘛
Be a lamb and check.

155
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,690
好吧
All right.

156
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,480
是哪个小可爱躲在这呀
Who do we have here?

157
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,110
是条蛇  一条吓人的蛇
It's a snake. A terrifying snake.

158
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,210
是不是哪个坏蛋把你丢到抽屉里啦
Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?

159
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,760
别装可爱说话了
Stop talking like that.

160
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,540
你应该被吓得说不出话来才对
You've been rendered speechless by fear.

161
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,760
咱们去生物实验室
Let's go to the biology lab

162
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,630
给你搞点美味的小白鼠来吃吧
and find you some nice yummy mice.

163
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,230
我居然想用蛇来吓唬印度佬
I tried to scare an Indian with a snake.

164
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,610
加油啊  库珀  你就这么点能耐吗
Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.

165
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,780
门没锁
It's open.

166
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,160
你现在有空吗
Hey, you got a minute?

167
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,490
当然  进来吧
Yeah, sure, come on in.

168
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,260
谢了
Thanks.

169
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,950
来点芝士通心粉吗
Want some mac and cheese?

170
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,870
不了  有乳糖  吃了会放屁
No. Lactose. Gas.

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,270
-酒呢  -不了  有亚硝酸盐  喝了会头痛
- Glass of wine?  - No. Sulfites. Migraines.

172
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,640
好吧  我本来想给你吃万圣节糖果
Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy,

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,420
不过都吃完了
but that's gone.

174
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,660
怎么了
So, what's up?

175
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,830
好吧  我们以前不是约过会吗
Okay, we used to go out, right?

176
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,060
老天  总算想起来你是谁了
Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.

177
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,940
我碰到了点难题
I'm dealing with a situation

178
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,340
是跟感情有关的
and it's kind of about my love life,

179
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,010
我知道咱俩谈这个  可能有点尴尬
so I know that might be weird for us to talk about,

180
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,240
但在这方面  你也知道
but in this area, as you know,

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,980
我其他的朋友实在是  蠢得可以
all my other friends are just so stupid.

182
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,080
好吧  怎么回事
All right, what's going on?

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,680
这么不介意我跟你谈吗
So, you're okay talking about this?

184
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,150
-当然  -你不会觉得尴尬吧
- Yes. - You're sure it's not weird.

185
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,580
真的不会
It's okay.

186
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,060
好吧  如果有天你想和我谈
You know what, if you ever want to talk to me

187
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
你跟男人的感情问题
about a problem in your life with a guy,

188
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,660
我也愿意听
then I would be fine with that.

189
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,460
那好  现在就有个我以前好过的小子
Okay, good, because there's this one guy I used to date

190
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,060
他要是再这样拐弯抹角
who's about to be force-fed wine and cheese

191
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,760
我就要灌他吃红酒和芝士
if he doesn't get to the point.

192
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,730
好吧
Okay,

193
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,570
是这样的
here it is.

194
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,940
这样算不算偷腥  如果一个男的有女朋友
Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend...

195
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,800
应该算的
Yeah, probably.

196
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,290
别这样嘛
Come on.

197
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,430
对不起  你说
I'm sorry, go ahead.

198
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,030
我新认识一个女孩子  她人很好
I met this girl, and she's great.

199
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,390
跟我有很多共同话题
we have a lot in common.

200
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,690
那你们搞了吗
Did you guys do it?

201
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,790
没有  只是亲热了一下下
No. We just made out a little.

202
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,140
哎呦  瞧你个小坏蛋
Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

203
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,340
你跟她提过普丽娅吗
Did you tell her about Priya?

204
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,050
我也想提  可她的舌头在我嘴里呢
Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.

205
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,030
真恶心
That's gross.

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,940
现在的情况是
Here's the thing,

207
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,140
我不是那种四处偷腥
I-I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around

208
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,070
拈花惹草的男人
and sleeps with more than one woman.

209
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,170
好孩子
Well, good for you.

210
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,070
可问题是  我想成为那种男人
The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.

211
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,780
那就瞒着普丽娅  把那女的睡了
So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.

212
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,380
我不是那种人
Oh, that's not who I am.

213
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,680
那好  那就跟那女的一刀两断
All right, then break it off with the new girl.

214
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,180
也别草率行事
Now, let's not do anything rash.

215
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,290
她真的很正点
She's really hot.

216
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,890
既然你这么喜欢这个女孩子
If you like this girl so much,

217
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,690
那干嘛不跟普利娅分手
why don't you just end things with Priya?

218
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,290
普丽娅和我深爱对方
Priya and I are in love.

219
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,620
我们以后说不定会结婚呢
I think we could get married someday.

220
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,220
莱纳德  你是想找个两全其美的办法
Leonard, you're looking for a way to sleep with both women

221
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,940
好让你左拥右抱
and have everybody be happy about it.

222
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,910
终于说到点上了
Now we're getting somewhere.

223
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,750
你的第一直觉是什么
What does your gut tell you?

224
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,380
"去问佩妮  她知道该怎么做"
"Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do."

225
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,730
你好  霍华德
Hello, Howard.

226
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,540
我知道你们吓我是闹着玩的
I've realized that you scaring me was all in jest.

227
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,120
请容许我说  吓得很成功
Allow me to say, job well done.

228
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,030
完美
Perfect.

229
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,880
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

230
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,310
搞科研呢  你不会懂的
Science. You wouldn't understand.

231
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,210
那好  再见  我出门了
Hey, well, see you. I'm going out.

232
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,640
我以为你是要出门呢
I thought you were leaving the apartment.

233
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,460
我也以为  可我下不了决心
Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.

234
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,730
你是不是担心外面的世界
Are you concerned because the world is filled

235
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,850
充满着疯狗和坏蛋
with big dogs and bullies?

236
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,850
不是  我正面临道德上的难题
No. I'm having a moral crisis.

237
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,760
如果需要帮忙的话
Well, if it's of any help,

238
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,930
我读过各种伦理学家的著作
I've read all the great moral philosophers,

239
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,200
美国著名作家及漫画家  以儿童书出名
包括苏斯博士的书哦
including Dr. Seuss.

240
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,810
死马当活马医吧
Oh, what the hell.

241
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,600
我本来要去见
I'm supposed to go see that girl

242
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
在漫画书店认识的那个女孩子  爱丽丝
from the comic book store, Alice,

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,990
可我不知道该不该去
but I don't know if I should,

244
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,120
因为我现在跟普利娅在一起
because I'm going out with Priya,

245
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,730
可她人又远在印度
but she's in India.

246
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,780
好吧  这么说现在的主题是性忠贞
All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.

247
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,430
苏斯博士在这方面估计靠不住
Probably won't be relying on Seuss here.

248
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,400
苏斯博士1960年著作
不过《一条鱼  两条鱼  红色的鱼  蓝色的鱼》
Although <i>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</i>

249
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,650
倒可能惊人的适用
might be surprisingly applicable.

250
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,530
继续
Go on.

251
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,450
那个
Well...

252
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,190
别人都说  人到了暮年
they say at the end of your life,

253
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,720
比起自己做过的事
you regret the stuff you didn't do

254
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,410
会更后悔没有做过一些事
more than the stuff that you did,

255
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,400
而我非常确定我很想跟爱丽丝"做"
and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.

256
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,510
德国哲学家弗里德里希·尼采
You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche,

257
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,980
相信道德只是低等人群体
believed that morality is just a fiction

258
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,750
用来阻碍少数高等人的
used by the herd of inferior human beings

259
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,690
虚构事物
to hold back the few superior men.

260
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,040
死马还真给医活了
That actually does help.

261
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,110
值得一提的是  他后来死于梅毒
It's worth noting that he died of syphilis.

262
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,900
-管他呢  我去也  -你回家的路上
- Screw it, I'm going.   - On your way home,

263
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,170
-能不能买点橙汁回来  -拜托
- will you pick up some orange juice? - Do you mind?

264
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,210
我正在质疑我人生中很多的人事物呢
I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.

265
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,080
你喜欢橙汁也需要质疑吗
Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?

266
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,500
-不用  -那就对了  纯果乐  要没果肉的
- No.  - Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

267
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,560
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

268
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,260
谁啊
Who is it!

269
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,570
沃罗威茨太太  是我  谢尔顿
It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

270
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,690
那不是我妈  是伯纳黛特
That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.

271
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,390
真的吗  真分不出来
Really? That's very unsettling.

272
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,950
嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

273
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,770
-嗨  -有事吗
- Hi.  - What's up?

274
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,300
我刚想到  我一直都还没正式恭祝过
It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you

275
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,720
你们即将到来的婚事
on your pending nuptials.

276
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,760
于是我跳上首班车
So I hopped on

277
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,400
一路狂奔过来跟你握手道贺
the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand.

278
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,180
快把手伸过来  你这家伙
Put 'er there, you old so-and-so.

279
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,760
再过12小时  咱俩就一起上班了
Well, I-I'm gonna see you at work in...12 hours

280
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,450
你怎么不等上班了再跟我握手呢
don't you think it could have waited until then?

281
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,330
我的老天  我怎么就没想到呢
Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that?

282
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,570
你果然比我聪明  霍华德·沃罗威茨
You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz.

283
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,140
快把手伸出来  你个小聪明
You put 'er there, you son of a gun!

284
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,750
那随你吧
Whatever.

285
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,370
天啊
My...oh...

286
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,590
我
it's...

287
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,690
天啊  霍华德
Oh, my God, Howard!

288
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,790
你对他做了什么
What did you do?

289
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,240
只是个无恶意的万圣节恶作剧而已  看
It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.

290
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,100
霍华德有心脏病  你又不是不知道
Howard has a heart condition! You know that!

291
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,290
我还以为他那是瞎编的呢
Well, I thought he made that up.

292
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,770
犹太人不是常有
I-Isn't hypochondria

293
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,600
疑病症的问题吗
a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

294
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,030
这是肾上腺素
This is adrenaline --

295
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,940
我们得把这个注射到他的心脏里
we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.

296
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,370
-我们得做吗  -是你做
- We are?  - You are.

297
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,310
我可没那么大劲扎穿他的胸腔
I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate,

298
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,500
而且机会只有一次
and we've only got one shot.

299
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,040
不  我做不来
Oh, no! I can't!

300
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,550
快点
Hurry!

301
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,630
咱们时间不多了
We're running out of time!

302
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,270
-好吧  -快扎呀
- Okay.  - Just do it!

303
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,130
上帝啊
Oh, God!

304
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,990
一  二
One...two...

305
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,830
三
three!

306
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,550
不给糖就捣蛋  笨蛋
Trick or treat, bubbeleh.

307
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,890
什么
What?

308
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,290
不是吧  你们居然设局耍我
No. You mean this was all a ruse?

309
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,080
我怎么会笨成这...
Oh, how could I be so stu...

310
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,170
该死的  不行
Damn it, I can't.

311
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,720
我不能这样
I can't do this.

312
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,890
是因为我的舌环吗
Uh, is it my tongue stud?

313
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,060
要是有穿舌环就会吓到你
'Cause if that freaks you out,

314
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,850
那待会儿你会更大吃一惊哦
you're in for a real surprise later on.

315
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,170
不  不是
No, no, no.

316
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,400
是我不能跟你这样
I-I can't do this.

317
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,610
相信我  我真的很想
Believe me, I really want to.

318
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,540
-但是呢  -但是我有女朋友了
- But...?  - But I kind of have a girlfriend.

319
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,580
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

320
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,270
你不介意咱俩只做朋友吧
You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?

321
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,710
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

322
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,740
等等  我...你不相信哪部分
Wait, I don't... Which part?

323
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,410
我真是笨到家了
I'm so stupid.

324
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,690
我还以为我终于遇上了个好人呢
I thought for once I'd met a good guy,

325
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,280
结果你也只不过又是一个混蛋而已
but you're just another jackass.

326
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,400
不  不  你误会了
Oh, no, no, you have it wrong.

327
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,980
不  我本来是要当个混蛋
No. I-I was going to be a jackass,

328
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,220
但是我克制住了
but I stopped myself.

329
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,860
我决定做个好人  所以
I stayed a good guy, so...

330
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,830
我还是不跟你滚床单了
I'm gonna pass on the sex.

331
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,190
但是你要知道  这并不代表你不够辣
But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness

332
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,830
这只是说明我品德高尚
but on my goodness.

333
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,360
这也算是我的超能力了吧
That's kind of my superpower.

334
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,380
我就像是  好人队长
I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.

335
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,690
没啥了不起的
It's okay.

336
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,210
做了对的选择
Did the right thing.

337
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,060
我悔得肠子都青了
You idiot!

338
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,760
普丽娅
Hey, Priya.

339
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
亲爱的  一切都好吗
Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?

340
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
不怎么样
Uh, not so good.

341
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,740
咱俩得谈谈
We have to talk.

342
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,190
好像很严重的样子啊  怎么了
Oh, sounds serious. What's up?

343
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,430
好吧  事情是这样的
Okay, uh...here it is.

344
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,240
我认识了一个女生  我们接吻了
I met this girl and I kissed her,

345
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,540
我觉得很内疚
and I feel terrible about it.

346
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,680
但都结束了  绝无下次
But it's done, it's never gonna happen again.

347
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,320
我真的非常非常抱歉
And I am so, so sorry.

348
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,920
莱纳德  别紧张
Leonard, relax.

349
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,720
没事的
It's okay.

350
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,880
真的吗
It is?

351
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,530
是啊  这种事情很正常
Yeah, these things happen.

352
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,740
人之常情嘛
They happen to everybody.

353
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,770
天啊  你真是太好了
Oh, my God, you are amazing.

354
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,760
我怎么这么命好呀
I mean, I don't deserve you.

355
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,290
等  等会  你说"人之常情"是什么意思
Wh-what do you mean "everybody"?

356
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,140
莱纳德  我不知道该不该说
Leonard, I didn't know if I should tell you,

357
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,330
不过我好像也背叛你了
but I kind of cheated on you, too.

358
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,870
什么叫好像
Kind of?

359
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,420
几周前
A couple of weeks ago,

360
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,460
我跟我前男友上床了
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

361
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,460
所以说  我们俩都犯了点小错误
So, I guess we both messed up a little.

362
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,660
不  我是犯了点小错  你可是犯了大错
No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.

363
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,920
咱这又不是在比赛
Well, it's not a competition.

364
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,990
就是比赛  而且你赢了
Oh...yeah, it is, and you won.

365
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,560
对  对不起  我要下线了
I-I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

366
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,380
老天爷你玩我啊
I don't believe this.

367
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,920
吓到了吧  小混蛋  现在我们扯平了
Bazinga, punk. Now we're even.
