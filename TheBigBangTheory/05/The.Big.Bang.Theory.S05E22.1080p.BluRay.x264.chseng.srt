1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,760
真希望你们能听到我的心声
I wish you could all be inside my head.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,990
我脑中的对白简直是精彩纷呈
The conversation is sparkling.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,030
还是跟你们分享一下吧
Fine, I'll tell you.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,240
地衣是由菌类和藻类  这两不同的物种
A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species,

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,720
组成的复合有机体
fungi and algae.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,660
如果你能跟别的物种结合
If you could merge with another species,

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,390
你会选哪种  原因是什么
what species would you pick and why?

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,120
提示  有正确答案的哦
Hint: There is a right answer.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,990
你们肯定都猜不到
None of you will get it.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,850
好吧  我会选天鹅
Okay, I'd pick swan because,

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,480
因为半人半天鹅
uh, the resulting hybrid would have

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,200
既能享受人类先进的工业文明
the advanced industrial civilization of a human

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,540
又能拥有我一直梦寐以求的优雅长颈
and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,130
错  莱纳德
Wrong. Leonard?

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,800
我选马  主要是因为马比较高
Horse, but mostly just for the height.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,770
其次是因为生殖器比较大
A little bit for the genital girth.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,260
错  能让这话题保持点格调吗
Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,600
我选袋鼠
Kangaroo, uh,

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,600
这样我就成了"犹袋鼠"
I'd be Kanga-Jew.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,930
我将会是第一个能灌篮的犹太人
The first of my people to dunk a basketball.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,400
还不用住在你妈妈的房子里
Also instead of just living in your mother's house,

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
因为你可以直接住在她的袋子里
you could actually live inside her body.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,690
挺妙的  但还是错
Clever, but also wrong.

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,550
人类最应该与之相结合的有机体
No, the best organism for human beings to merge with

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,990
是地衣本身
is the lichen itself.

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,150
这样  你既是人类  也是菌类和藻类
That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,370
三面手哦
Triple threat.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,590
像三豆沙拉一样
Like three-bean salad.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,260
给我举个例子  证明这三面手有用武之地
Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
没问题  试想一下
All right, picture this:

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,730
一场高雅的户外音乐会
a beautiful outdoor concert.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,260
作为人类  我能够欣赏贝多芬的音乐
Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,970
作为菌类  我能够沿着耸立的枫树生长
As a fungus, I have a terrific view,

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,970
以获得最棒的视野
growing out of a towering maple tree.

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,170
我也无需花钱买高昂的酒水
And no thank you, expensive concessions.

36
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,500
因为作为藻类  我以光合作用维生
Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,240
-他又赢了  -才不是
- He got us again. - No, he didn't.

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,440
无论怎样  如果你不介意
Anyway, if it's okay with you,

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,640
我们该讨论一下霍华德的单身派对了
we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,310
我刚发表完关于地衣的大论
Seems like a bit of a letdown

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,570
你换谈这个  层次低好多啊  但...
after our lichen conversation, but...

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,610
我也不苛责了  毕竟你是半人半天鹅嘛
what do you know, you're half swan.

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,830
我研究了一下脱衣舞女
I've been doing some research on strippers.

44
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,500
其中一家说  如果不在乎表演者
One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,730
岁数与是否残疾  价钱绝对包君满意
if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,970
感觉挺有意思啊
Sounds like loads of fun,

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,470
可我已答应伯纳黛特  不找脱衣舞女了
but I promised Bernadette no strippers.

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,930
你居然不想找脱衣舞女
You don't want strippers?

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,150
装什么啊  你可是脱衣舞之王啊
You're the king of strippers.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,520
北好莱坞的一家脱衣舞俱乐部
The one club in North Hollywood

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,110
还用你的名字命名了一根钢管呢
named a pole after you.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,410
怎么说呢  我对那玩意已经不感兴趣了
What can I tell ya, I'm not into that stuff anymore.

53
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,110
不错啊  霍华德  真为你自豪
Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you.

54
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,950
可你是我们几人中第一个结婚的
And still, you're the first one of use to get married.

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,490
总得干点特别的事吧
We have to do something special.

56
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,320
知道吗  德国人有个有趣的婚前习俗...
You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom--

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,850
估计不太适合我吧
Well, it's probably not for me.

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,100
去纳帕谷怎么样
Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley.

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
那里有品酒列车
They've got that wine train.

60
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,870
酒  坏东西
Boo, wine!

61
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,890
火车  好东西  我要加入
But yay, trains. I'm in.

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,300
现在这个时节  那里的景色很美
Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,310
穿行于葡萄园中
Uh, you travel through the vineyards.

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,540
火车上溢满葡萄酒的香气
There's a tasting on board.

65
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,080
漫山遍野的花朵争奇斗妍
And all the wildflowers are in bloom.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,020
简直是仙境
Magic.

67
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,260
看啊  才过了三十秒
Look at that, in 30 seconds,

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,930
咱们从"玩女人"变"当女人"
we went from hiring women to being them.

69
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,280
生活大爆炸第五季第二十二集

70
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,750
听说你们几个
So, I hear you and the lost boys

71
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,530
今晚要开个单身派对呢
are having a bachelor party tonight.

72
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,470
是啊  就是去餐馆
Yeah, just going to a restaurant,

73
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,030
吃吃牛排  喝喝威士忌
get some steaks, and scotch.

74
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,240
-你不用担心  -我有什么好担心的
- Nothing to worry about. - Why should I worry?

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,620
始终是个单身派对嘛
Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party.

76
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,650
兴许我们会找脱衣舞女来呢
There could be strippers.

77
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,390
你难道就一点都不吃醋吗
Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?

78
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,950
拜托  莱纳德  我对你放心都很
Oh, come on Leonard, it's you. What's going to happen?

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,070
即使真的有脱衣舞女
I mean, even if there was a stripper,

80
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,600
你也不敢跟人有眼神接触
all you'd do is avoid eye-contact

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,100
没准还会主动提出辅导她孩子功课呢
and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,880
拜托  我很年轻  欲火如日中天
Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime.

83
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,870
天时地利人和具备  我也是能做出...
Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just,

84
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,560
非常疯狂的事情的呢
really crazy stuff.

85
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,680
是吗  那说说你与女人做过
Really? What is the craziest thing

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
最最疯狂的事情是什么
you've ever done with a woman?

87
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,910
你我于海中"翻江倒海"的那次可不算
And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.

88
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,470
别这样啊  那必须得算
Oh, come on. That's got to count.

89
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,040
那天激流暗涌  我们可能随时葬身海底
There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
祝你今晚玩得痛快啊
Well, have fun tonight.

91
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,390
放心吧  我会的
Oh, I will.

92
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,400
会发生什么事  我可不保证哦
There is no telling what might happen.

93
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,860
绝对没事
Yeah, there is.

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,920
帮特殊职业的女人辅导孩子过高考
You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,410
我得好好夸夸拉杰
Hey, I got to hand it to Raj,

96
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,680
他找的餐馆还挺适合开单身派对呢
he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.

97
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
的确不赖
It's not bad.

98
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,250
但一与火车相比  这地方就相形见绌了
Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.

99
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,830
你在喝威士忌吗
Are you drinking whiskey?

100
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,990
没错
Indeed.

101
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,900
如果我要参与进这种社会习俗
If I'm to participate in the social convention

102
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,260
也就是这个单身派对
that is the stag night,

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,760
我就得接受所有的东西
then I must embrace all its components:

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,350
包括香烟  脏话
including tobacco, swear words,

105
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,610
当然还有酒
and yes, alcohol.

106
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,370
亲娘咧  太难喝了
Jeepers! That's yucky.

107
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,120
活动才刚开始
Whoa, it's a little early to start

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,850
就把亲娘挂嘴边骂  太快了吧
dropping J-bombs, don't you think?

109
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,940
-你们好呀  -你好呀  威尔
- Hey, you guys. - Oh, hey, Wil.

110
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,540
谢谢能来参加霍华德的派对
Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.

111
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,110
如果我不来这儿
Well, it was either this or another

112
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,240
《星际迷航》中苏鲁田光的扮演者
就得去乔治·竹井家参加泡澡派对了
hot tub party at George Takei's house.

113
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,250
我不太明白
I'm confused.

114
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,050
我以为自从我们和解之后
I thought since our reconciliation,

115
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,550
这帮人里只有我才是你的朋友
I was your friend in this group.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
霍华德也是我的朋友
Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,290
原来你只求数量  不求质量
I guess you're just friends with anybody.

118
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,800
莱纳德
Hey, uh, Leonard...

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
最近漫画书店的生意不太好
things are a little tight at the comic book store.

120
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,610
我可能需要你先帮我垫餐钱
I might need some help covering my share of the check.

121
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,280
没问题
Oh, yeah, no worries.

122
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,120
还有给服务员的小费
And maybe a few bucks for the valet.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,140
可以
Oh, all right.

124
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,080
还有回家的油钱
And gas money to get home.

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,330
-当然  -太好了
- Yeah, sure. - Great.

126
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,730
你知道吗  这是我爷爷的手表
You know what? This is my grandfather's watch.

127
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,050
18K金的  战争时期从欧洲弄来的
18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.

128
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,660
不错  挺好看的
Wow, that's very nice. Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,920
一百块卖给你
100 bucks and it's yours.

130
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,290
各位
Hey, everybody!

131
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,290
派对主角来了
The bachelor boy has arrived!

132
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,780
* 他是个快乐的好小伙 *
* For he's a jolly good fellow *

133
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,980
* 他是个快乐的好小伙 *
* For he's a jolly good fellow *

134
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,070
* 他是个快乐的好小伙 *
* For he's a jolly good fellow *

135
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,120
* 大家都说他是好小伙 *
* Which nobody can deny *

136
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,350
没错没错  他个快乐的好小伙
Yes, yes, yes. He's a jolly good fellow.

137
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,450
请问脱衣舞女什么时候来
What time do the strippers arrive?

138
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,310
巴里  我们今晚没请脱衣舞女
Actually, Barry, we're not going to have strippers tonight.

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,210
那我找了两百块散钱搞毛啊
Ah, then what the frig did I get 200 dollars in singles out for?

140
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,400
你想买手表吗
You want to buy a watch?

141
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,630
首席伴娘艾米·菲拉·福勒
This is Maid of Honor Amy Farrah Fowler,

142
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,260
为你带来大喜之日
bringing you the wedding activities

143
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,530
前几周的婚礼活动
just weeks out from the big day.

144
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,270
看看这位年轻漂亮  容光焕发的美女
Let's check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman,

145
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,630
旁边那边  则是她的准新娘朋友
and her friend who's about to get married.

146
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,910
美女们  能说说你们在做什么吗
Ladies, can you tell us what you're doing?

147
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,410
这些是礼品袋
Um, these are gift bags

148
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,950
我们准备把它们放到外地宾客的房间里
we're going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests.

149
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,710
这是一张帕萨迪纳的地图
This is a map of Pasadena.

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,620
这是一张本地餐馆的清单
This is a list of local restaurants.

151
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,020
还有给霍华德亲戚准备的
And then, for Howie's relatives,

152
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,820
抗组织胺剂[抗过敏]  抗酸剂[胃药]
we have antihistamines, antacids,

153
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,740
还有治腹泻和便秘的药
and medicine for diarrhea and constipation.

154
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,710
我们在上面贴了"泻停封"和"泄挺疯"
Yeah, we labeled them "stop and go."

155
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,220
好的  转到主要问题上
All right, pivoting to the big question:

156
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,860
伯纳黛特  洞房花烛夜
Bernadette, on your wedding night

157
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,500
你们将正式圆房
you'll be consummating your marriage.

158
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,980
新婚小夫妻打算采用哪种
What do you think your first sexual position will be

159
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,480
性交体位呢
as husband and wife?

160
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,310
艾米  拜托
Amy, please.

161
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,740
记住  谁在上
Keeping in mind that whoever's on top

162
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,860
谁就掌握婚姻大权哦
may set the tone for the marriage.

163
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,950
好了  别拍了
Okay, show's over.

164
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,620
他们说不定能在新婚之夜怀上孩子呢
Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night.

165
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,050
你不觉得孩子将来看到这个
Don't you think the kid might get a kick

166
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,490
会很高兴吗
out of knowing how it happened?

167
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,850
我不管
I don't care.

168
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,220
你应该问"会不会从霍华德的姓"这类问题
Ask her things like "Are you going to take Howard's name?"

169
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,330
而不是"谁会骑在谁的上面"
Not "Who's going to sit on who."

170
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,120
我其实想过用连字符把两个姓串起来
I've actually been thinking I'm going to hyphenate:

171
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,090
伯纳黛特·玛丽安·罗斯滕科斯基-沃罗威茨
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

172
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,150
不错
Nice.

173
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,030
你应该去注册一个
You know, you should totally get

174
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,640
伯纳黛特·玛丽安·罗斯滕科斯基-沃罗威茨网站
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.com

175
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
以免被别人抢先注册
before someone snaps it up.

176
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,840
霍华德已经注册了
Howard already took care of it.

177
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,650
而且  他还建了个很漂亮的婚礼网站
Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding Web site

178
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,120
上面有我们两家家族史的小故事
with cute little facts about our family histories.

179
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,590
你知道吗  在波兰有一段时间
Do you know, for a while in Poland,

180
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,000
我们两家还是邻居
my family and his family were neighbors.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,750
那太好了
Oh, that's cool.

182
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,830
一点也不好  我以后再跟你解释
No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.

183
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,630
请大家听我说两句
May I have your attention, please?

184
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,130
我们今晚齐聚一堂  庆祝我死党霍华德
We are here tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials

185
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,740
即将步入婚姻的殿堂
of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.

186
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,470
干杯  干杯
Hear! Hear!

187
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,480
显然他是威尔·惠顿的死党呢
And, apparently, Wil Wheaton's best friend.

188
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,540
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

189
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,530
懒得鸟你
Talk to the hand.

190
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,710
有没有人想对
Does anyone have any words

191
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,600
今晚的主人公说几句
they'd like to say about our man of the evening?

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,770
我来
I do.

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,620
按照传统习惯
As is the tradition,

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,790
我准备了一些无礼的笑话
I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes

195
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,530
来取笑霍华德  娱乐大众
which generate humor at Howard's expense.

196
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,410
准备笑到肚子疼吧
Prepare to have your ribs tickled...

197
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,880
霍华德
Howard...

198
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,420
我一直以为你会是我们当中最后结婚的人
I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married,

199
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,450
因为你四肢短小  其貌不扬
because you are so short and unappealing.

200
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,520
我说的对吧
Am I right?

201
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
看看下面这个
Let's see here.

202
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,280
不过话说回来  霍华德
Oh, seriously though, Howard,

203
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,620
你其实是我认识的最聪明的人之一
you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know.

204
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,850
这是笑点  因为你不是
And that's a zinger, because you're not.

205
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,220
我一直以为  总有一天
I've always thought that you'd make

206
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,290
你会"做"个好丈夫
someone a fine husband someday.

207
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,220
前提是你能找齐零件
Assuming you'd be able to get the parts,

208
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,750
并拥有足够的工程技术
and develop the engineering skills

209
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,780
能把自己组装成好丈夫  不过应该是没戏吧
to assemble them, which I don't see as likely.

210
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,190
好笑吧
Hacha!

211
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,650
好  再看看这个
Okay... Let me see here.

212
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,530
好了  不说笑了
Okay, kidding aside--

213
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,810
霍华德  你是一个益友
Howard, you are a good friend.

214
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,970
我希望你幸福美满
And I wish you nothing but happiness.

215
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,580
逗你玩  我才不呢
Bazinga, I don't!

216
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,050
-谢尔顿  -还是逗你玩  我希望你好
- Sheldon... - Double bazinga! I do!

217
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,580
要跟上哥的思维  你得加油啊
Good luck following that.

218
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,060
霍华德·沃罗威茨要结婚了
So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot.

219
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,700
要将疯狂的单身生活抛诸脑后
Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind.

220
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,570
他是个疯狂的人
He was a wild one.

221
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,740
不过  我们又何尝不是呢
Well, I guess we all kind of were.

222
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,950
我记得有一次
I remember this one time,

223
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,730
我和一个姑娘去了海边
I was with this girl at the beach.

224
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,720
我们在海水里  然后开始亲热
We were in the ocean and we started making out.

225
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,870
我知道这挺疯狂的
I know, it was crazy.

226
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,630
我连耐克户外鞋都没穿呢
I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks.

227
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,790
接下来
Then...

228
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,660
没人想听  霍夫斯塔德
Nobody cares, Hofstadter.

229
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,860
总结陈词吧
Wrap it up.

230
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,440
好吧
Right.

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,490
敬霍华德
To Howard.

232
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,180
敬霍华德
To Howard.

233
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,090
哥绝对"翻江倒海"过
I totally had sex in the ocean.

234
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,310
好吧  我来说几句吧
Okay, I'll go.

235
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,790
霍华德  当我想到你和伯纳黛特
Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette

236
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,610
马上要开始共筑美好人生时
starting this wonderful life together,

237
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,420
我就情不自禁地想哭
I can't help but get a little choked up.

238
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,080
我是说
I mean...

239
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,220
你看看你
look at you.

240
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,680
坐拥一切
You have everything.

241
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,620
你再看看我
Look at me.

242
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,640
我都三十七岁了
I'm 37.

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,160
还住在漫画书店的后面
I sleep in the back of a comic book store,

244
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,620
而且我的骨密度  堪比八十岁的老头
and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man.

245
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,170
敬霍华德
To Howard.

246
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,730
敬霍华德
To Howard.

247
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,830
-谁是下一个  -我来
- Um, uh, who's next?  - I'll go.

248
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,390
霍华德  我要说几句大家心里有胆想
Howard, I'm gonna say something to you that everybody's thinking

249
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,950
却没胆说出来的话
but no one has the courage to say out loud.

250
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,630
当你邀请一个男人参加单身派对时
When you invite a man to a bachelor party,

251
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,500
潜台词就是  现场会有脱衣舞女
the implication is, there will be strippers.

252
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,970
或许不是一丝不挂
Maybe not completely nude,

253
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,630
但至少得看见小内内或丁字裤吧
but at least pasties and G-strings.

254
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,420
这要求相当合理
That's not unreasonable.

255
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,450
-说得好  说得好  -说得好  说得好
- Hear, hear.  - Hear, hear.

256
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,580
好了  还有谁要说两句吗
Okay, uh, anybody else?

257
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,430
没了吗
Huh? No?

258
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,680
好吧  那就由我这个伴郎来压轴吧
Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man.

259
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,170
这杯开胃酒把人家喝得"性致"大开哟
Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper.

260
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
言归正传  当我第一次来到这个国家时
Okay, okay, when I first came to this country,

261
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,580
我不懂如何待人处事  也不懂如何穿衣打扮
I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress,

262
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,510
更不知道什么才叫做酷  人家那时候很寂寞
or what was cool...I was pretty lonely.

263
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,420
可当我遇到霍华德之后
But then I met Howard,

264
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,640
突然间  我的人生就此改变
and suddenly, my life changed,

265
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,390
因为有人陪我一起寂寞
because we could be lonely together.

266
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,610
这个男人变成了我的全世界
This man became my whole world.

267
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,790
说得好  小美人
Yeah, nice speech, Francine.

268
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,900
我还没说完呢  不过谢谢
I'm not done, but thank you.

269
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,580
我回想起...
I think back....

270
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,010
我们曾共度的美好时光
...to all the good times we had, like, uh,

271
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,110
比如说  我们那次去露营
when we went camping and spent that night

272
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,070
彻夜不睡  分享彼此的小秘密
telling each other all our secrets.

273
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,780
我告诉他  我很爱修脚
I told him I'm addicted to pedicures

274
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,480
而他告诉我  他的初夜给了他的表姐
and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.

275
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,610
那是我的远房表姐
She was my second cousin.

276
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,150
也是你第一个让人"不满足"的性伴侣
And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually.

277
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,930
逗你玩呀  逗你玩
Ba-da-bazinga!

278
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,360
没错  还有一次
Oh...oh, yeah, and then there was the time

279
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,100
我和莱纳德带霍华德去拉斯维加斯
when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas

280
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,220
我们雇了个妓女  让她假扮成犹太人
and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish

281
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,390
然后勾搭他  说想吃他的犹太"小黄瓜"
and that she wanted his little kosher pickle.

282
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,480
在所有的"霍华德搞妓女"的故事中
Of all the "Howard humping hookers" stories,

283
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,290
我最爱的就是这个了
that one's my favorite!

284
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,980
好了  兄弟  够了  坐下吧
Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.

285
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,820
还有那个在动漫节上
Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl

286
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,340
扮成美少女战士的胖妞
in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?

287
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,260
不记得了  坐下吧
Don't remember. Please sit down.

288
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,070
那是我这辈子唯一一次3P经历
The only threesome I've ever had in my life,

289
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,450
而且我很自豪地说  就是跟这边这位男人一起干的
and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.

290
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,600
我求求你闭嘴吧
Oh, please shut up.

291
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,110
千万别误会
Oh, oh, don't get me wrong,

292
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,310
我和霍华德之间什么也没发生
nothing happened with me and Howard.

293
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,650
我俩中间还夹了两百磅的美胖女战士呢
There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.

294
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,320
这段子绝对要在网上红爆了
Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.

295
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,170
亲娘咧  我喝高了
Jeepers, I'm drunk.

296
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,000
谢谢你来接我们
Thank you for picking us up.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
威士忌瓶子上还贴着一条警示标语呢
There's a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle.

298
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
老弟  一杯下肚之后
You cannot be operatin' heavy machinery

299
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,020
绝对不可以操作重型机械哦[苏格兰口音]
after you had a snootful of this, laddie!

300
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,910
好好笑
Funny.

301
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,660
你们几个玩得开心吗
You boys have a nice time?

302
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,700
还不错吧
Yeah, it was great.

303
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,270
如我保证般  十分低调
Low-key, like I promised.

304
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,390
没有乱来  没有脱衣舞女
No hanky-panky, no strippers.

305
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,160
只是一堆男人讲讲笑话而已
Just the guys telling jokes.

306
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,830
不错啊
That's nice.

307
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,370
你呢  你今晚玩得开心吗
How about you? Did you have a fun night?

308
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,610
不错  我们包了一下礼物  喝了点红酒
Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine,

309
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,660
然后上网看到了这个
and then went online and saw this.

310
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,610
在所有的"霍华德搞妓女"的故事中
Of all the "Howard humping hookers" stories,

311
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,770
我最爱的就是这段了
that one's my favorite.

312
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,890
其实这离我家已经不远了
You know, we're not that far from my apartment.

313
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,370
你可以把我放下来  让我自己走回去吧
If you stop the car, I can walk from here.

314
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,120
你哪也别想去  3P男
You ain't goin' anywhere, Threeway.

315
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,160
-伯纳黛特  听着  -你骗了我
- Bernadette, listen...  - You lied to me.

316
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,200
你说你向我坦白了你所有的女人
You said you told me about all the girls you've been with,

317
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,220
可你从未提过你还睡过你的表姐
but you never mentioned your cousin,

318
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,710
妓女  还有拉杰
the prostitute or Raj!

319
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,590
说真的  你都用不着停车
Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car.

320
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,230
只要车速不超过每小时十英里
Anything under ten miles an hour

321
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,460
我就能安全跳下车
and I can combat-roll into the street.

322
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,870
好吧  我要澄清一下
Okay, just to set the record straight,

323
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,240
妓女不是我雇的  那是他送我的礼物
I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him.

324
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,700
你真不知廉耻  拉杰
Shame on you, Raj.

325
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,300
在美国  你可不能这样对待女人
That is not how we treat women in this country.

326
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,970
你少把一切都推到他头上
Don't you try and blame this on him.

327
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,290
-谢谢你  伯纳黛特  -闭嘴吧  变态
- Thank you, Bernadette.  - Zip it, pervert!

328
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,480
我不知道我该怎么办
I don't know what I'm going to do.

329
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,720
再过两个礼拜我就要嫁给霍华德了
I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple weeks

330
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,860
可我不确定我是否还对这男人了若指掌
and I'm not sure I even know who the man is anymore.

331
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,700
我很好奇你最郁闷的是哪件
I'm curious what's bothering you most:

332
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,780
近亲乱伦  招妓
the borderline incest, the prostitute

333
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,630
还是跟穿得像儿童卡通的女孩玩3P
or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?

334
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,270
艾米  还记得我教过你
Amy, remember when we went over things

335
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,440
什么话该说  什么话不该说吗
that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?

336
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,050
记得
Right.

337
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,840
-那我刚才说的话...  -不该说
- And that was... - Not.

338
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,810
我初识霍华德时  觉得他很纯良
When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me,

339
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,310
只是个跟妈妈同住的善良小伙
just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.

340
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,440
你要是喜欢这样的男生
Well, if that's what you like,

341
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,980
我可以带你去漫画书店
I'll take you to the comic book store--

342
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,550
那里都是这样的小伙
the place is full of 'em.

343
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,310
等下
Wait a minute.

344
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,530
是你撮合我和霍德华的
You set me up with Howard.

345
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,600
你当时就知道他做的全部恶心事吗
Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?

346
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,920
一点点吧  道听途说而已
Well, a little. You hear stuff...

347
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,000
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

348
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,730
我想告诉你的  但我觉得
Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think

349
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,430
你们肯定撑不过第一次约会
it would go past the first date.

350
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,950
撑过之后  我又觉得
Then, when it did, I thought for sure

351
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,530
等见完她妈妈  你们俩也该分手了吧
it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother.

352
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,700
最迟等到滚过床单后  也肯定该分了
Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together.

353
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,640
处处都是警告信号
I mean, the warning signs were there--

354
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
要怪也只能怪你
this is really on you.

355
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,410
老天啊
God!

356
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,100
亏我还把你当朋友
I thought you were my friend.

357
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,510
你刚说的  也是不该讲的吧
I don't think that was helpful.

358
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,550
小妮妮  还是我
Hi, Bernie, it's me again.

359
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,210
请给我回电
Please call me back.

360
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,330
兄弟  我太对不起你了
Dude, I am so sorry.

361
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,580
这不是你的错  是我的
It's not your fault, it's mine.

362
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,890
事都是我干的  不是你
I did all that stuff, not you.

363
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,350
事实上  有一件倒是你们俩一起"干"的
Actually, you did do one of them together.

364
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,650
给
Here.

365
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,770
这是什么
What is this?

366
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,440
你很低落
You're upset.

367
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,440
按我的习惯  要给伤心人一杯热饮
The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.

368
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,940
不是  我是说这是什么热饮
No, but what is it?

369
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,280
鸡汤
Chicken broth.

370
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,330
犹太人也都爱喝鸡汤嘛
It seemed culturally appropriate.

371
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,530
而且  这一整块鸡精块
Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon

372
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,040
从我刚搬进来就在那橱柜里了
in the cupboard when I moved in

373
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,370
这事困扰了我八年之久
and it's been bothering me for the last eight years...

374
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,610
正所谓  一石二鸟嘛
So, as they say, two birds.

375
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,960
我不知道接下来该怎么做了
I don't know what my next move is.

376
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,460
霍华德  我不大了解女人
Well, Howard, I don't know much about women...

377
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,470
-然后呢  -没了  就这句话
- Yeah? - No, uh, that, that's it.

378
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,260
我不大了解女人
I don't know much about women.

379
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,270
拉杰  你有建议吗
Raj, you got anything?

380
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,310
我有漫画展上那个胖妞的电话号码
I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.

381
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,110
我才不打给漫画展认识的妞
I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.

382
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,330
好吧
All right.

383
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,350
那美胖女战士  我独享咯
More Sailor Moon for me.

384
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,300
我把单身派对吐光光了
I just threw up the bachelor party.

385
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,260
求你出来吧  伯纳黛特
Please come out, Bernadette.

386
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,860
我们来谈谈
Let's talk through this.

387
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,840
不要  别理我
No, leave me alone.

388
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,670
或许你该以其人之道还治其人之身
Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine.

389
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,980
你有没有特别迷人的表兄弟
Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?

390
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,990
艾米
Amy.

391
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,870
是你把那个下流胚子介绍给她的
Hey, you introduced her to the sleazebag.

392
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,760
我只是帮你收拾烂摊子
I'm just trying to clean up your mess.

393
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,950
我想找伯纳黛特谈谈
I need to talk to Bernadette.

394
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,820
她现在估计不想跟任何人谈吧
Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.

395
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,430
好吧  能请你至少帮我转告她吗
All right, well, could you at least give her a message?

396
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,170
当然
Yeah, sure, I guess.

397
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,070
告诉她我真的很抱歉
Tell her I'm really sorry.

398
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,030
如果她不想嫁给我了  我能理解
And if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it.

399
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,480
但我真的想让她明白
But what I really want her to know

400
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,860
她所厌恶的那个我
is the guy that she's disgusted by,

401
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,080
也是我所厌恶的
is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too.

402
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,290
但昨日种种譬如昨日死
But that guy doesn't exist anymore; he's gone.

403
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:06,760
正是因为她  我才改过自新
And the reason is because of her.

404
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,240
如果她要跟我分手
So, if this relationship is over,

405
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,410
请帮我告诉她  是她让我成为更好的男人(重获新生)
let her know that she made me a better man,

406
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,430
帮我谢谢她
and tell her thank you.

407
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,030
天啊  霍华德
Oh, my God, Howard.

408
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,530
那是我听过最动人的话语
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.

409
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,680
而且还是你这货讲出口的
And it came out of you.

410
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,600
华仔
Howie?

411
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,680
佩妮有话要转告你
Penny has a message for you.

412
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,410
我都听到了
I heard.

413
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,890
你的声音跟你妈的一样
Your voice, not unlike your mother's,

414
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,770
穿墙入耳
travels through walls.

415
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,960
需要我离开吗
Do you want me to go?

416
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
不
No.

417
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,300
过来
Come here.

418
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,890
我还在很气你呢
I'm still really mad at you.

419
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,420
我明白
I get that.

420
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,030
你的过去  还有什么是我该知道的吗
Is there anything else about your past I should know?

421
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,000
还有几件吧  但大多数都发生在海外
Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas.

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,570
我之后再告诉你
I'll tell you later.

423
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,800
好吧
Okay.

424
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,580
婚礼还继续吗
So, is the wedding still on?

425
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,800
好啦  婚礼继续
Yeah, the wedding's still on.

426
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,490
感谢老天
Oh, thank God.

427
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,730
我还可以当伴娘
I'm still a maid of honor!

428
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,520
管他呢
Oh, what the hell.

429
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,060
这场面好热辣啊
This is kind of hot.

430
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,900
你怎么穿着睡袍啊
What's with the robe?

431
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,250
我要在此时此地
I'm gonna have sex with you right here,

432
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,250
与你  在那台洗衣机上翻云覆雨
right now, on that washing machine.

433
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,260
没门
No, you're not.

434
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,080
来吧  求你
Come on, please.

435
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,880
你真想做什么的话
If you want to do something,

436
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,400
帮我一起叠床单吧
you can help me fold this sheet.

437
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,650
穿着内裤叠床单  还是很疯狂
Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
