1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,280
我去商店里买点东西
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,330
等你剪完再来接你
I'll pick you up when you're done.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,130
好
Okay.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,670
我比较喜欢你在这儿陪我  不过没关系
I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,640
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,720
嗨  我来找诺费奥先生为我理发
Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,960
真抱歉  托尼舅舅还在医院呢
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,180
他病得很厉害
He's pretty sick.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,480
天啊  诺费奥先生在医院
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,090
我的命运为何如此多舛
Why do these things always happen to me?

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,510
我可以帮你理发
I can cut it for you.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,350
你不是诺费奥先生
You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
我的头发一般是诺费奥先生理的
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,230
你信得过这家伙吗
You believe this guy?

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,700
先失陪一下
Excuse us for a second.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,470
谢尔顿  没关系  他能行的
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,330
他也是个理发师
He's a barber.

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,190
他不是理发师  他是理发师的外甥
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,360
他就是理发界日益猖獗的
He's an example of the kind of nepotism

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,130
裙带关系的典型范例
that runs rampant in the barbering industry.

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,660
另外  诺费奥先生很清楚我喜欢什么样的发型
Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,300
因为他有我在德州理发时的理发记录
because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,660
你在瞎扯什么啊
What are you talking about?

24
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,190
我刚搬来这里的时候
When I first moved here,

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,040
找新理发师这事儿很让我发愁
I was nervous about finding a new barber,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,320
所以我妈就把我的理发记录
so my mother had all my haircut records

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,210
都寄给了诺费奥先生
sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,920
根本没有理发记录这回事
There's no such thing as haircut records.

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
不  肯定有的
Yes, there are.

30
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,740
你见过你的理发记录吗
Have you ever seen them?

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,160
没  不过我妈妈保证肯定寄过来了
No, but my mother assured me they were sent here,

32
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,070
我敢跟你打包票
and I'll bet you dollars to donuts

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,570
这家伙肯定没我的理发记录
that this one doesn't have them.

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,160
打扰一下
Uh, excuse me.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,010
你能拿到我的理发记录吗
Do you have access to my haircut records?

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,200
你的什么
Your what?

37
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,640
托马斯·斯特恩斯·艾略特
著名美国诗人  诺贝尔文学奖得主
用T·S·艾略特的诗来说
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,120
世界就是这样告终的
this is the way the world ends--
这句改自他的作品《空心人》  原文为
"世界就是这样告终的  不是砰的一声而是一声抽泣"

39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
不是砰的一声而是一个外甥
not with a bang but with a nephew.

40
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,230
谢尔顿  你都是个大人了  他也是专业人士
Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional,

41
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,330
而且你的发型是1946年那张海报上的第三个
and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946.

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,700
赶紧坐下
Just sit down

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,930
让他给你剪吧
and let him do it.

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,430
好吧  如果我剪完看起来个傻蛋
Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork,

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,490
那就全赖你
it's on you.

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,190
我家小孩今天讲了件特别有意思的事
So my kid said the funniest thing today.

47
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,140
算了
Nope.

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,710
如果你日后跟别人说这事
When you tell this story later,

49
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,430
记得用"古怪"这个词来形容
the word we usually use is "quirky."

你能把帕马森干酪递给我吗
Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,610
好
Sure.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,990
把我的头发从眼前吹开
I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,130
谢尔顿  你就是晚了一天没理发而已
Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.

56
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,690
谢谢你  一句话点明了我的恶梦
Thank you for captioning my nightmare.

57
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,040
瞧  我收到我的随行指示信了
Lookie here, I got my travel orders.

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,200
"随行专家霍华德·沃罗威茨受命
"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,630
前往位于德州休斯顿的国家宇航局
to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center,

60
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
约翰逊太空中心
Houston, Texas,

61
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,970
于周日早上八点接受宇航员特训"
for astronaut training Monday 8:00 a.m."

62
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,040
不过这是宇航局的信  所以时间得按照军事格式来念
Yeah, but it's from NASA, so it's 0800.

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,540
可上面写的是"早上八点"
But it says "8:00 a.m."

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
你得按照军事格式来念"0800"
You read it as "0800."

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,030
可它前面没写有"O"啊
It doesn't have an "O" in front of it.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
你知道哪句话前面有"O[哦]"吗
You know what does have an "oh" in front of it?

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,610
"哦  我的天  我现在是宇航员了"
"Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,

68
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,960
"你就羡慕嫉妒恨吧"
and you're dying of jealousy."

69
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,220
那他们要...
So, what kind of things are they...?

70
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,770
你能消停会儿吗
Will you stop that?

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,390
我忍不住  感觉自己就像是个少女杀手
I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,880
谢尔顿  我以前常给我哥剪头发
You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,950
我也能帮你的
I could do it for you.

74
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,840
佩妮  我知道这是你的一片好心
Penny, I know you mean well,

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,880
用你们村里的手艺来帮我  不过呢
offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um,

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,970
在我们城里
here in town,

77
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,530
我们不用搅乳器来搅黄油
we don't churn our own butter,

78
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,670
我们也不用麻袋来做裙子
we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks,

79
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,010
我们也很确定不想让一个染黄发的丫头
and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut

80
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,010
来给自己理发
by bottle-blonde...

81
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,670
谢尔顿  为人要友善
Sheldon, be nice.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,690
不好意思  有个坏小子的发型
I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude

83
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,110
就有个坏小子的脾气
that comes with this hair.

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
你可以试试我的理发师
You could go to my guy.

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,740
他在比弗利山庄[富人区]的著名美发沙龙
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

86
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,920
他们会给你沏茶  会给你按摩头皮
They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp.

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,790
虽然要两百块  不过没准有时坐在你旁边的
It's about $200, but sometimes you look in the next chair

88
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,920
就是一位超级巨星  比如托尼·丹扎
and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.

89
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,600
快速提问
Quick question here:

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
我们真的已经把话题
Have we actually changed the conversation

91
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,930
从"我要去参加宇航员特训"
from "I'm going to astronaut training"

92
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,000
转到"谢尔顿找不到地方理发"了吗
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

93
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,080
你看现在是谁在羡慕嫉妒恨
Now who's dying of jealousy?

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,030
"哦"  是你啊
"Oh," it's you.

101
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,200
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,190
你把我们的情侣对唱之夜都给毁了
you're ruining girlfriend- boyfriend sing-along night.

103
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,580
抱歉
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,650
我在找理发店  我的时间不多了
I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time.

105
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,830
我的头发正以每飞秒
My hair is growing at the rate
1飞秒等于10的-15次方秒
1幺米等于10的-24次方米

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,920
4.6幺米的速度生长着
of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond.

107
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,750
你要是安静点  还能听见头发生长的声音
I mean, if you're quiet, you can hear it.

108
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,450
要不去"超级剪"美发沙龙呢
What about Supercuts?

109
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,470
我去过一次
I tried once.

110
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,790
那里无论男人还是女人
They do men's and women's hair

111
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,780
都坐在同一个房间里一块剪
in the same room at the same time.

112
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,350
那简直就像是带有摩丝的罪恶之城
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.

113
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,630
这件事没那么严重
Well, this isn't a crisis.

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,060
何不干脆让头发长长点算了
Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?

115
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,060
何不干脆让头发长长
Why don't I let my hair grow out?

116
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,730
那我何不干脆开始穿凉鞋
Um, why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks

117
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,830
并用"你喜欢不"这句话
and seeking validation of my opinions by asking

118
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,440
来求证我的选择
"Can you dig it?"

119
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,890
我不知道啊
Well, I don't know.

120
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,340
我是觉得你留长头发挺性感的
I think you might look sexy with long hair.

121
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,110
就留那种齐肩长发
The kind that flows down to your shoulders

122
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,390
骑马的时候还能随风飘动
and blows back while riding on a horse.

123
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,230
马背光溜溜  你胸光溜溜
Bareback and bare-chested.

124
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,450
brush my teeth  可用来指代"自慰"
我要去"刷牙"了  估计得刷一会儿
I'm gonna go brush my teeth; it might take a while.

125
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,030
宝贝儿
Hi, sweetie.

126
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,980
我想你
I miss you.

127
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,680
我也想你了
I miss you, too.

128
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,150
你第一天过得怎么样
So tell me all about your first day.

129
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,720
我该从哪讲起呢
Oh, wow, where do I even start?

130
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,020
我体验了零重力
I got to experience zero gravity.

131
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,640
酷  他们怎么做到的
Cool. How do they do that?

132
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,460
还挺简单的
It's pretty neat.

133
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
你坐进飞机
You get in this plane

134
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,600
然后垂直上升  历时大概二十秒左右
that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds,

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,270
然后再跟要坠机一样  垂直下落
and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and

136
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,660
如此循环往复
they do it over and over again, you know,

137
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,560
吐到连胆汁都快出来了也没人管
no matter how many times you throw up.

138
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,480
你吐了吗
You threw up?

139
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,740
是啊  而且最变态的是
Yeah...and the craziest part is,

140
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,290
因为是零重力环境
because there's no gravity,

141
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,290
呕吐物就浮在空中
the throw-up kind of floats there...

142
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,590
呈一个球状
in a little ball,

143
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,890
如果你吓得大叫
and if your mouth is open

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,840
嘴巴张开的话
because you're screaming...

145
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,800
有时呕吐物就会再飘回你嘴里
...sometimes it just floats right back in.

146
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,470
天啊  到时候你就沦为大家的笑柄
Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.

147
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,230
他们听起来好坏哦
That sounds mean.

148
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,390
没有
No.

149
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,000
其实我当时也想笑的
Yeah, I would have laughed, too,

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,220
只不过我不想让呕吐物二次飘回我的嘴里
but I didn't want the vomit to come back out.

151
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,330
总而言之
Anyway...

152
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,060
对了  你能不能帮我
Oh, could you do me a favor

153
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,170
连夜快递几条内裤过来
and overnight me some more underwear?

154
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,350
没问题  怎么了
Sure, why?

155
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,000
今天看了一眼那台离心机
I got a look at the centrifuge

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,650
明天我要在里面进行高速旋转训练
they're going to spin me around in tomorrow,

157
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,470
于是我隐约感觉到我带的内裤不够
and I have a hunch I packed a little light.

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,660
诺费奥先生
Mr. D'Onofrio?

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,380
是我  谢尔顿
It's me, Sheldon.

160
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,250
礼品店里没有任何和理发相关的礼物
They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop,

161
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,150
所以我给你买了这个
so I got you this.

162
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,140
不知道您能不能看见他T恤上的小字
I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt.

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,250
上面写着  快点"熊"起来哦
It says, um, "Get well bear-y soon."

164
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,950
相信我  如果现在您稍微有点意识
Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now,

165
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,190
肯定也会发笑的
you'd be laughing.

166
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,770
总而言之
Anyway...

167
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,200
有一项新的研究表明  昏迷中的人
There's new studies that show, people in comas

168
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,020
也能感知到身边发生的一切
are aware of everything going on around them.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,110
所以说  如果您现在能听到我说话
With that in mind, if you can hear me,

170
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,060
请离开您的病床
move away from the light

171
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,080
跟着这把剪刀的声音走
and toward the sound of these scissors.

172
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,640
有什么可以帮到你吗
Can I help you?

173
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,040
是的
Yes.

174
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,680
你这里有类似理发店大围布的东西吗
Do you have something I could use as a cape?

175
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,710
天啊  你是不是把药给吐了
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,

176
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,920
然后从九楼[精神病科]偷溜出来
slip out of the ninth floor,

177
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
跑到这探险来了
and go on a little adventure?

178
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,500
不  不
Oh, no, no,

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,010
我只是来找他理发的
I'm just here to get my hair cut.

180
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,060
我明白了
I-I see.

181
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,350
你在这等一下
J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.

182
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,260
保安
Security!

183
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,210
我得跑了
I got to run.

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,530
但是不能拿着剪刀  那样太不安全了
But not with scissors -- that would be unsafe.

185
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,120
要是我把我的小马挪到这来
So, if I move my horsey here...

186
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,960
是不是就将军了  我是赢了吧
...isn't that checkmate and I win?

187
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,390
到底是不是我赢了
Well, is it or isn't it?

188
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,870
我们今天就下到这吧
You know, I think this is a good stopping point.

189
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,130
你第一次下象棋
Uh, it's your first real game.

190
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,890
有太多知识要消化了
I threw a lot of information at you.

191
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,190
不
Well, no,

192
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,590
你的国王被我困住了
I mean, your king is trapped.

193
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,160
他不能往这走  因为我在这摆了个灯塔[车]
He can't go here because of my lighthouse,

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,340
还有
and...

195
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,530
他也不能往这走  因为我在这摆了一个尖头小人[象]
he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.

196
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,400
正如我说的  这个游戏很复杂
Like I said, complicated game.

197
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,120
那我到底赢没赢
So did I win or not?

198
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,330
你玩得开心吗
Did you have fun?

199
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,300
因为只要你玩得开心了  就算是赢了
Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner.

200
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,380
象棋就是这样
That's, that-that's what chess is all about.

201
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,930
-抱歉  谢尔顿  我这就挪开  -何必呢
- Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.  - Eh, why?

202
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,070
我的位置  你的位置  有区别吗
My spot, your spot-- what difference does it make?

203
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,440
好吧  刚刚发生了什么
Okay, what just happened?

204
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,910
我不知道
I don't know.

205
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,210
一会是你的象棋技术堪比世界冠军
Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer

206
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,960
一会是谢尔顿不介意你坐了他的位置
and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot,

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,500
我估计是有人穿越回去  踩死了只虫子[蝴蝶效应]
I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug,

208
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,690
改变了人类的历史进程吧
and changed the course of human events.

209
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,100
亲爱的  你没事吧
Uh, sweetie, are you all right?

210
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,470
不  我有事
No, I'm not all right.

211
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,630
我本来六天前就该剪头发了
It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut

212
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,690
除此之外  无大事发生
and nothing horrible has happened.

213
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,920
不好意思  我不懂
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

214
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,830
莱纳德  给她解释下
Leonard, explain it to her.

215
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,020
那个  他疯了
Oh, uh, he's crazy.

216
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,070
我用了一生时间
I have spent my whole life

217
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,730
精心安排我每天该做什么
trying to bring order to the universe

218
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,530
就是想要给这个世界带来秩序
by carefully planning every moment of every day.

219
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,780
而我所有的努力
But all my efforts--

220
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,400
我的晚餐安排  我的睡衣轮换制
our dinner schedule, my pajama rotation,

221
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,240
我的排便情况试算表
my bowel movement spreadsheet--

222
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,140
现在我算明白了
it's clear now,

223
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,570
我一直在浪费时间
I've been wasting my time.

224
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,020
很好  我要把那恶心的表格从冰箱上拿下来
Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.

225
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,760
听我说  谢尔顿
You know, Sh-Sheldon,

226
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,830
有时未来不可预知也挺好的
sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming.

227
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,990
我是说  看我和莱纳德
I mean, look at me and Leonard.

228
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,020
我们约会  分手  现在又试着复合
We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again.

229
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,300
我们也不知道未来会怎么样
We don't know what's gonna happen.

230
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,860
得了吧  你们会怎么样大家都心知肚明
Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen.

231
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,120
但我懂你们的意思
But I see your point.

232
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,570
我觉得这样对你挺好
I think this could be good for you.

233
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,180
也许你是该有所改变了
Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.

234
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
你说的没错
You're right.

235
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
我应该接受无序的世界
I should embrace the chaos.

236
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,620
很好
Great.

237
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,830
那你先要做什么
What are you going to do first?

238
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,950
我不知道
I don't know.

239
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,480
我什么都可以做
I could do anything.

240
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,110
原来的规则通通丢掉
All bets are off.

241
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,770
出自莎士比亚
世界由我主宰
The world is my oyster.

242
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,590
我知道了
I got it.

243
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,780
我今晚要穿我星期二的睡衣
I'm going to put on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

244
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,970
我得说  我有点担心他
I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.

245
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,540
如果我是你  我会更担心刚有一个
If I were you, I'd be worried that a girl

246
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,380
从没下过象棋的女生  让你输得落花流水这个事实
who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.

247
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,390
华仔  你怎么了
Howie, what happened to you?

248
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,270
我们通宵在野外进行生存训练
We did overnight survival training in the wilderness.

249
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,270
好玩
Big fun.

250
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,060
超级好玩
Big, big fun.

251
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,540
我本想在跟你视频之前洗把脸
I was gonna freshen up for you

252
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,410
但我在去洗手间的路上  晕过去了一小会儿
but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.

253
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,890
生存训练
Survival training?

254
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,050
就像露营那样吗
Is that like camping?

255
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,090
对啊
Uh-huh.

256
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,520
除了没有食物和水
Except you don't have food or water,

257
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,850
也不像汉斯·克拉默营那样的
and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service

258
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,130
日出而作  日落而息
like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.

259
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,960
你是在帐篷里睡吗
Do you sleep in tents?

260
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,080
不是
No.

261
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,240
我睡在一个洞里
I slept in a hole

262
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,540
还是我徒手挖的洞
I dug in the ground with my bare hands.

263
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,270
而且晚上的时候
And at some point during the night,

264
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,850
一只穿山甲爬了进来
an armadillo crawled in

265
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,350
还给了我爱的抱抱
and spooned me.

266
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,190
可怜的孩子
Poor baby.

267
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,280
但我做到了
But I did it.

268
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,730
我活下来了
I survived.

269
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,650
我不知道沙尘暴来时该往哪儿躲
I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

270
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,940
我只能拉起高领毛衣盖着头
I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head

271
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,680
呆那儿等死
and waited for death.

272
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,740
但当我坐在那的时候
But somehow as I sat there,

273
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,410
裹在满是汗味的衣茧里
wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat,

274
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,640
我发现了人类精神的真谛
I found that primal part of the human spirit

275
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,640
就是要活下去
that just wants to keep on living,

276
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,810
无论付出什么代价
no matter what the cost.

277
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,650
你太勇敢了
You're so brave.

278
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,990
我为你自豪
I'm proud of you.

279
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,590
我吃了只蝴蝶
I ate a butterfly.

280
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,060
那只蝴蝶好小
It was so small

281
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,530
也很美
and...  beautiful,

282
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,870
但我好饿
but I was so hungry.

283
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,000
你在哭吗
Are you crying?

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
不  我觉得这不可能
No, I don't think it's possible.

285
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
我已经严重脱水了
I'm severely dehydrated.

286
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,960
我的尿就跟牙膏一样稠
My pee is like toothpaste.

287
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,920
华仔  如果你坚持不住  就回家吧
Howie, if you're not able to do this, come home.

288
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,400
我对你的感觉不会变的
It won't change how I feel about you.

289
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,800
谢了  亲爱的  但我不能放弃
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

290
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,930
不然的话  我就是一个
If I do, I'll just be a guy

291
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,110
有机会成为宇航员  却中途放弃的人
who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.

292
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,400
那我能为你做什么吗
Well, is there anything I could do to help?

293
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,790
没有
No.

294
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,160
等等  再多寄点内裤来
Wait. Send more underwear.

295
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,780
千万别是谢尔顿在打小手鼓
Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.

296
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,600
拜托千万别是谢尔顿在打小手鼓
Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.

297
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,740
莱纳德呀  你喜欢我的小手鼓吗
Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos?

298
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,190
但我想呀  你没猜到我有小手鼓吧
Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.

299
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,080
谢尔顿  现在是凌晨三点
Sheldon, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning.

300
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
凌晨三点呀
3:00 in the morning

301
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,420
正适合弹小手鼓呀
is a good time for bongos.

302
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,200
我刚在睡觉
I was sleeping!

303
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,540
莱纳德在睡觉  而我在打小手鼓
Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.

304
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,310
不  他被吵醒了
No, he doesn't.

305
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,770
莱纳德被吵醒了  而我在打小手鼓
Leonard no sleep while I play bongos.

306
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,080
小手鼓独奏
Bongo solo.

307
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,610
停  住手
Stop! Stop it!

308
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,610
住手  别敲了
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

309
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,850
他妈的怎么回事啊
What the hell?!

310
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,830
佩妮  你猜怎么着
Penny, guess what?

311
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,870
谢尔顿有对小手鼓
Sheldon got bongos.

312
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,830
为什么你会有小手鼓
Why did you get bongos?

313
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,520
理查德·费曼会打小手鼓
Richard Feynman played the bongos.

314
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,110
我就想说我也该试试
I thought I'd give that a try.

315
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,040
理查德·费曼是位著名物理学家
Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,270
莱纳德  现在是凌晨三点
Oh, Leonard, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning.

317
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,370
我才不管理查德·费曼
I don't care if Richard Feynman

318
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,710
是不是我屁股里住着的紫色妖精呢
was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

319
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,770
佩妮是假设费曼是紫色妖精
Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun.

320
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,970
佩妮忘记要用虚拟语气了
Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.

321
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,000
谢尔顿  睡觉去
Sheldon, go to bed.

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
你明早还有工作要做
You have work in the morning.

323
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,020
或许有  或许无
Maybe, maybe not.

324
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,910
或许明天我组个小手鼓乐队巡回演出去了
Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.

325
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,190
不不  你等等
No, no, hang on, uh, uh,

326
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,400
根据《室友协议》
Roommate Agreement.

327
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,930
晚十点后不能唱民谣
No hootenannies,sing-a-longs,

328
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,310
伴唱或男声四重唱
or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.

329
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,760
《室友协议》
Roommate Agreement?

330
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,860
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

331
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,230
我们生活在一个无序的世界
We are living in a world of chaos.

332
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,800
管他狗屁《室友协议》呢
Roommate Agreement.

333
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,060
你去哪
Where are you going?

334
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,120
我要跟着音乐走  喵喵
Wherever the music takes me, kitten.

335
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,990
我打着小手鼓呀  下着小楼梯呀
I play bongos walking down the stairs.

336
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,250
千万不要  边打小手鼓边下楼梯
Never play bongos walking down the stairs.

337
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,880
给你个惊喜
Surprise.

338
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,790
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

339
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,510
我是来助你度过难关的
I'm here to help you get through this.

340
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,610
你自己做不来的
You can't do it on your own,

341
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,320
你需要有人来照顾你
you need someone to take care of you.

342
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,460
我太爱你了
Oh, I love you so much.

343
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,840
我也爱你
Oh, I love you.

344
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,380
霍华德  洗澡水快凉了
Howard, your bath is getting cold!

345
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,390
别担心  一旦她睡着
Don't worry, once she falls asleep,

346
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,740
我会像穿山甲一样给你爱的抱抱
I'll spoon you like an armadillo.

347
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,490
昨晚半夜他带着小手鼓出现
He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos.

348
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,500
我错误以为这是某种音乐求欢方式
I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.

349
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,460
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

350
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,280
他一定精疲力竭了
He must have been exhausted.

351
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,890
谢尔顿想睡着呀  而莱纳德在打小手鼓呀
Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!

352
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,810
你这样有点过分吧
That was kind of uncalled for.

353
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,280
不  一点也不过分
No, it was called for.

354
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,780
怎么回事
What's going on?

355
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,650
好了  谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon,

356
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,470
你也该闹够了
this craziness has gone on long enough.

357
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,650
拜托回家去  让我给你理发吧
Please come home so I can cut your hair.

358
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,070
佩妮  你没受过培训
Penny, you're not trained.

359
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,340
你也没有执照
You're not licensed.

360
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,980
更重要的是  你拿不到我的理发记录
Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records.

361
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,930
好了  宝贝
All right, honey, look,

362
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,940
我们认识很久了  对吧
we've known each other for a long time now, right?

363
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,360
我曾带你去过迪斯尼乐园
I've taken you to Disneyland,

364
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,500
我帮你踢过欺负你的恶霸的关键部位
I kicked a bully in the nuts for you,

365
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,610
你病了我就给你唱《软猫猫》
I sing you "Soft Kitty" when you're sick,

366
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,560
甚至你有次还见过我的裸体
you've even saw me naked once.

367
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,400
抱歉  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

368
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,710
说来话长
It was a long story.

369
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,030
谢尔顿  我发誓我不会乱来
Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing.

370
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,820
求你让我帮你理发吧
Please let me cut your hair.

371
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,080
艾米  你认为呢
Amy, what do you think?

372
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,910
我愿意让她帮我修剪我身上的任何一处毛发
There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.

373
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,470
好吧  走吧
Fine, let's go.

374
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,660
谢谢你让我睡在你的沙发上
Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.

375
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,350
很少有女人会一直追着男人问
There's only so many times a woman can say,

376
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,700
"睡我床上好不好"
"How about the bed?"

377
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,460
谢尔顿怎么会见过你的裸体呢
What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?

378
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,920
放心吧  我只看到过她的屁股和乳房
Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.

379
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,460
差不多了
Almost done.

380
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
每次理完发
At the end of the haircut,

381
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,540
诺费奥先生都会给我讲个黄色笑话
Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.

382
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,230
抱歉  我不会说什么黄色笑话
Sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.

383
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,360
没事  反正我也从来没听懂过
That's okay, I never understood them anyway.

384
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,700
好了  觉得如何
Okay, what do you think?

385
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,030
有点好莱坞的感觉
it's a little Hollywood.

386
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,410
不过我觉得我会看习惯的
But I think I can pull it off.

387
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,410
理得不错  佩妮
Well done, Penny.

388
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,610
早告诉你啦
Ha, told you.

389
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,510
只需理一下脖子这块的头发
Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little

390
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,370
-你就可以走了  -好玩
- and then you are good to go. - Fun time.

391
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,340
抱歉  有时这剃刀弄得我好痒痒
Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.

392
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,560
好吧
Okay.

393
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,670
好了  大功告成
Okay, yep, we're all done now.

394
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,670
只是...挺好的
It's just... it's good.

395
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,200
让我帮你把这块布拿下来
Let me just take that away from you.

396
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,870
-好了  -非常感谢
- Okay. - Thank you very much.

397
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,050
不客气
You are welcome.

398
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,020
看来我非搬不可了
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.
