1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,890
先生们  我想我找到了一个

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,570
让年轻人对科学感兴趣的办法了
to get young people interested in science.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,160
Mad Libs 是一种填词游戏
物理疯狂填词游戏
Physics Mad-Libs.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,030
一篇文章中若干单词空缺  并指定填入单词的词性
其他人或自己可以随机说出一些固定词性的单词

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,690
-给我个数字  -五
- Now, give me a number.  - Five.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,340
等都填完之后  这篇故事就会被念出来以达到一种幽默的效果

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,690
再给我一个无理数
And an irrational constant.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,000
E[欧拉数]
"E."

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,820
再来一个搞笑的希腊字母

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,990
γ[希腊语的第三个字母]
Gamma.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,540
我说了要搞笑的
I said funny.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,080
-那Y[希腊语第二十个字母]呢  -不错

好了  听好了
Okay. Get this.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,980
"琼斯教授在讨论会上宣布
"Professor Jones told the symposium

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,680
他找到了计算介子质量的新办法
he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon.

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,920
E到Y极限的五倍..."
Five times the limit of  'E' to the upsilon as..."

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,240
好吧  不笑了  不笑了
Okay. No, no.

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,180
我重说一遍
I'll start over.

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,930
"琼斯教授"
"Professor..."

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,330
打从莱纳德犯了个乘法错误后
I haven't seen him laugh that hard

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,830
我还真没见他狂笑成这样过
since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.

25
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,550
天啊  那个乘法错误
Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error!

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,930
他以为自己有进位
He thought he carried the one.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,140
其实根本没有
But he didn't.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,820
一点也不好笑
It's not funny.

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,840
那篇错误的论文还被发表了
That mistake got published.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,140
别说了  我笑得都快尿裤子了
Stop! I'm going to wet myself!

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,910
伙计们  伙计们  赛博特校长朝咱们走过来了
Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.

32
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,310
-他来干嘛  -看样子不太爽
- I wonder what he wants.  - Doesn't look happy,

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,170
所以我猜应该是来找谢尔顿的
so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,170
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper?

35
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,620
我就说嘛
Told ya.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,440
赛博特校长
Oh, President Siebert,

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,710
我猜您是来回复我在您办公室旁放置的
I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions

38
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,610
建议箱里的其中一条建议吧
I put in the box by your office.

39
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,810
不是  你别再到处给我装建议箱了
No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.

40
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
您不喜欢书面建议
You don't like written suggestions.

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,490
您也不喜欢咱们一起上厕所时
You don't like when I give them to you

42
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,340
我给您的口头建议
while we're urinating in the men's room.

43
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,990
要不是我对您有所了解  我会以为您也是
If I didn't know you any better, I'd say that you're one of those

44
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,550
那种固执己见  不肯采纳他人意见的老古板呢
stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.

45
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,470
库珀博士  物理学部门的主席告诉我
Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me

46
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,260
你不肯休假
you're refusing to take your vacation.

47
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,540
我不需要休假
I don't need a vacation.

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,130
你有休假的义务
You're obligated to take one.

49
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,140
而且我想告诉你  在你没经过我同意
And I'd also like you to know the most-often received

50
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,370
就擅自给我装的建议箱里  收到的最多的建议就是
suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me

51
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,610
"能不能让库珀博士去休假呀"
is "Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?"

52
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,420
好吧  问题解决  那咱们就周一见咯
Okay, settled, then. I'll see y'all of you Monday,

53
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,840
除了你
except for you.

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,080
但如果我不来上班
But if I don't come into work,

55
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,480
那我自己要去干嘛
what am I supposed to do with myself?

56
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,880
看书  休息  旅游
Read, rest, travel.

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,690
我听说这个季节去阿富汗不错
I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,060
是说反话吗
Sarcasm?

59
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,360
不是  你真该去一趟
No. You should go.

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,570
生活大爆炸第五季第十六集

* 齐来狂欢 *

66
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,590
* 钱早备好  尽情挥霍...*
* I got my money, let's spend it up... *

67
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,620
上帝啊
Good Lord!

68
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,700
你别跟猫叫春一样行不
Would you stop that caterwauling!

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
你在这里干嘛
What the hell are you doing?!

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,110
听你蹂躏我的耳朵到出血呀
Bleeding from my ears.

71
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,570
你藏在我车后座上干嘛
What are you doing hiding back there?

72
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,240
我要偷溜去上班
I'm sneaking into work.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,440
如果大学门口的保安问你
Now, if the guard at the university asks

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,540
毯子下面藏着什么
what's under the blanket,

75
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,560
你就跟他说是捕龙虾的装置
you tell him it's some lobster traps.

76
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,350
-捕龙虾的装置  -没错
- Lobster traps?  - Yes.

77
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,650
维尔玛和史酷比就是这样
That's how Velma and Scooby
皆为美国著名卡通《史酷比》中的人物

78
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,750
把主人毛毛偷运进那个老灯塔里的
smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
你进到学校里面以后怎么办呢
What are you going to do when you get to the university?

80
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,360
人们肯定会认出你的
People are going to recognize you.

81
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,590
有可能吗  莱纳德
Will they, Leonard?

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,630
好吧  乖乖藏回毯子底下
Fine. Just get back under your blanket,

83
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,900
我会载你过去的
and I'll drive you there.

84
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,800
不许再唱歌了
And no more singing.

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,230
好吧
Fine.

86
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,580
<i>我手机有导航</i>
<i>I have GPS on my phone.</i>

87
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,010
我知道你掉头了
I know you turned around.

88
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,920
我真高兴你说服了霍华德
I'm so glad you talked Howard

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,240
不要用克林贡语来写你们的结婚喜帖
out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.

90
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,930
翻过来看背面
Turn it over.

91
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,650
希望我的亲戚会以为这是希伯来语
I'm hoping my relatives think it's Hebrew.

92
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,700
今天终于来了
This is really happening.

93
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,740
我要当伴娘了
I'm gonna be a maid of honor.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,740
我将穿着一条漂亮的裙子  走过教堂的走廊
I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,690
然后迎来我的大日子
and, finally, I will have my special day.

96
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,790
你是说我的大日子吧
You mean my special day?

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,260
某人的新娘头纱得要加大码的
They're gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody's head.

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,850
如果我真的能结成婚
If I ever actually ever get married.

99
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,970
为什么结不成
Why wouldn't you?

100
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,290
因为我爸呗
My dad...

101
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,120
我挣得钱比华仔多
'Cause I make a lot more money than Howie,

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,460
所以我老爸逼我签订一个婚前协议
he's putting a lot of pressure on me to get a prenup.

103
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,790
这可不妙
Ouch.

104
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,300
是啊  华仔会抓狂的
Yeah. Howie's gonna freak out.

105
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,030
来自父母的压力还真是可怕
Parental pressure can be daunting.

106
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,160
记得我以前因为不愿刮腿毛而跟我妈吵架
I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs.

107
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,120
去年我终于举腿投降  让她把我刮了
Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,940
我真不知道该怎么跟他说这件事
I just don't know how I'm gonna break it to him.

109
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,110
我坚信向男人宣布坏消息的最好时机
You know, I'm a big believer in breaking bad news

110
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,410
就是跟他在床上的时候
to a guy when you're in bed with him.

111
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,970
我就是这么告诉我高中男友
That's how I told my high school boyfriend

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,520
我跟他哥上床的事情
I slept with his brother.

113
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,190
然后场景不变  再把主角换成他哥
That's how I told his brother the same thing.

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,590
我不知道  可我不想用性来操纵他
I don't know, I don't want to manipulate him with sex.

115
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,630
亲爱的  这才是性的用处所在
Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.

116
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,970
其实婚姻和金钱的联系  早在过去便如此
You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new.

117
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,030
"结婚"一词在过去就是指
In fact, the term "wed" referred to the money and livestock

118
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,970
新郎付给岳父的金钱和牲畜
that the groom paid the bride's father.

119
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,700
比如
For example,

120
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,980
如果你长得标致
you're adorable,

121
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,610
聪明伶俐又会挣钱
intelligent and a good earner.

122
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,510
保守地说  你也能得到
I could conservatively see you going for

123
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,510
至少两头牛和一只鹅
at least two oxen and a goose.

124
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,390
而你  绝对能收到一头独角兽
You would fetch a unicorn.

125
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,320
谢尔顿  有很多度假胜地你可以去
Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take.

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,570
夏威夷怎么样
What about Hawaii?

127
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,660
莫洛凯岛在十九世纪后成为夏威夷群岛中专门关押麻疯病人的地方
夏威夷就是昔日坐落在活火山上的麻风病人隔离区
Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano

128
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,460
《迷失》的烂结局也是在那里拍的
where the disappointing ending to <i>Lost</i> was filmed.

129
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,620
Mahalo为夏威夷语
真他妈感谢你  夏威夷
Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,740
那佛罗里达呢
How about Florida?

131
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,110
那里有卡纳维拉尔角
They got Cape Canaveral,

132
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,040
迪士尼乐园  我的艾达姨妈也在那
they got Disney, they got my Aunt Ida

133
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,510
她集了世界上最全的糖尿病患吃的糖果
and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy.

134
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,280
而且  你要是汗出得够多
Plus, if you get sweaty enough,

135
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,230
还可以用她的塑料膜沙发玩激流勇进
her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.

136
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,600
小时候俺家去佛罗里达旅行过一次
My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child.

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,980
在沙滩上  一只海鸥偷了我一条热狗
A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach.

138
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,860
我就知道这儿不欢迎我
I got the message.

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,340
我要是能放一周假
You know, if I had a week off, I'd go back

140
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,720
我会再去沙漠温泉酒店
to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,600
告诉你们  让特雷弗给你按摩一小时
I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor,

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,740
你会酥软到觉得自己生来就没骨头
and you'll feel like you were born without bones.

143
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,340
我估计受不了一个男的给我按摩
I don't think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.

144
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,890
是吗  那昨晚你玩X-BOX的时候
Really? What was I doing to your neck last night

145
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,630
我在给你的脖子做什么
while you were playing X-Box?

146
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,980
感觉我就像生活在独裁之中
It's like I'm living in a dictatorship.

147
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,520
"你一定要去度假  你一定要开心
"You must take a vacation, you must have fun,

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
你一定要享受生活"
you must enjoy life."

149
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,520
你好像误解了独裁的意思吧
I don't think you have a good handle on dictatorships.

150
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,630
谢尔顿  每个人都需要休假
Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.

151
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,300
理查德·费曼以前也被逼着休假
One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation,

152
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,630
可他选择拓宽思维
but he chose instead to expand his mind

153
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,870
学一些新知识
and learn something new.

154
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,270
他去了朋友的生物实验室工作
He went to work in his friend's biology lab.

155
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,170
理查德·费曼是美国著名的物理学家
Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist,

156
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,710
曼哈顿工程  是第二次世界大战期间
盎格鲁国家秘密研发原子弹项目的代号
参与过曼哈顿工程
part of the Manhattan Project.

157
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,210
科学界的人都知道理查德·费曼是谁
Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.

158
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,680
你是现在才知道的吧
Now you do, too.

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
我想到了一个绝妙的主意
Oh! I have a brilliant idea.

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,150
艾米是生物学家  我可以去她的实验室工作
Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.

161
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,720
这不就是费曼的主意吗
Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

162
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
几秒钟前你还没听说过他
Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
现在就装起专家来了
Now you're an expert.

164
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,350
-这么巧  -这是要洗的衣服吗
- Hey, you. - Is that your laundry?

165
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,930
怎么才这么几件
You only have, like, six things in there.

166
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,300
我没有零钱了
Yeah, I didn't have any quarters,

167
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,000
所以一直偷偷把衣服塞到别人的衣服堆里
so I've been sneaking stuff into other people's loads all day.

168
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,370
如果我告诉你一件事
Hey, if I tell you something,

169
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,240
你能保证不告诉别人吗
will you promise not to tell anybody?

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,380
我说什么无所谓  反正你也会告诉我
It doesn't matter what I say, you're gonna tell me anyway.

171
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,850
什么  才没有这回事
What? That is not true.

172
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,490
伯纳黛特想签婚前协议
Bernadette wants a prenup.

173
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,020
这事过分了吧
Wow. That's rough.

174
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,890
这么说如果我成了著名影星
So you're saying if I became a famous movie star,

175
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,760
我们结婚的话  你不会签婚前协议吗
we got married, you wouldn't sign a prenup?

176
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,430
绝对不会
Absolutely not.

177
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,640
如果我要待在家里带孩子
If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids

178
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,020
而你在出外景
while you're on location

179
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,050
瑞安·高斯林  好莱坞帅哥影星
跟瑞安·高斯林玩偷吃
cheating on me with Ryan Gosling...

180
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,900
那莱纳德就不是这么好打发的了
then Leonard gots to get paid.

181
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,210
你想过我们结婚吗
So, you think about us getting married?

182
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,010
我想的东西可多了
I think about a lot of things.

183
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,410
我会想我们结婚
I think about us getting married,

184
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,780
我也会想我们分手
I think about us breaking up.

185
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,410
有时  我还想
Once in a while, I think about

186
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,910
自己上个月在停车场
how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes

187
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,570
撞了人家的奔驰没留字条
I dinged in the parking lot last month,

188
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,010
不过喝杯酒就抛到九霄云外了
but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.

189
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,390
随你怎么说笑  但你还是想了
Joke all you want, but you think about it.

190
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,420
告诉你一件事
Well, tell you one thing,

191
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,630
我要是真要结婚了  绝对不用克林贡语写喜帖
if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.

192
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,090
祝你能用这态度去抓住男人的心
Good luck catching a man with that attitude.

193
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,140
哎哟喂
Boy, oh, boy!

194
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,020
这次度假有了个美好的开端
This vacation is off to a wonderful start.

195
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,910
甲醛的气味
The smell of formaldehyde...

196
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,240
离心机的嗡嗡声
the whir of the centrifuge,

197
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,280
被送去解剖的实验室动物
the distant chatter of lab animals

198
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,140
那渐渐远去的叫喊声
being dispatched for dissection.

199
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,220
我觉得自己的担心在慢慢消逝
Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.

200
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,340
我很高兴能和自己的男朋友公事
I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.

201
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,900
肯定很浪漫
It's gonna be romantic.

202
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,520
真会扫兴
Way to kill the mood.

203
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,130
别这么说  谢尔顿
Come on, Sheldon.

204
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,830
我们可以像玛丽·居里和她丈夫皮埃尔那样
We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre,

205
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,100
他们日夜并肩工作
who spent their days working side by side,

206
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
沐浴在爱和镭的光辉下
bathed in the glow of their love and the radium

207
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,250
那玩意儿最终还要了她的命
that ultimately killed her.

208
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,700
《美女与野兽》弱爆了
Screw <i>Beauty and the Beast;</i>

209
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,980
这才是迪士尼应该拍的爱情故事
<i>that's</i> the love story Disney should tell.

210
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,680
好吧  我们从什么开始呢
Okay, what do we start with?

211
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,050
要不拼接一些基因  克隆一只羊
Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep,

212
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,200
或者在一只老鼠背上植个人耳
perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back?

213
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,900
哈哈  我是个怪胎
Ha-ha, I'm a freak!

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,050
我准备做一些脑干组织的实验
Oh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology

215
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,280
你可以用那块海绵
while you put yourself on the business end

216
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,770
洗那些烧杯
of a sponge and wash those beakers.

217
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,270
洗烧杯
Wash those bea...

218
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,290
我明白了  欺负新来的是吧
Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella.

219
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,230
我还得眼睛睁大点
Yeah, I'd better keep an eye out for, what,

220
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,680
小心显微镜上有鞋油
shoe polish on the microscope,

221
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,430
烤芝士三明治里有疯牛病菌  是吧
or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?

222
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,140
不是  我真的要用干净的烧杯
No, I just need those beakers washed.

223
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
小兔子乖乖  赶紧干活了
Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

224
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,550
拜托  大名鼎鼎的谢尔顿博士在你实验室呢
Wha...? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.

225
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,880
你就让他做洗碗的工作啊
You're gonna make him do the dishes?

226
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,420
那不等于叫绿巨人
That's like asking the Incredible Hulk

227
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,040
去开泡菜罐头嘛
to open a pickle jar.

228
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,290
谢尔顿  你从没在生物实验室工作过
Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before.

229
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,890
你对生物领域毫无经验
You have no experience in the field of biology.

230
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,330
我对生物的经验可多了
I have plenty of experience in biology.

231
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,760
我1998年买了个电子宠物鸡
I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998.

232
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,370
瞧
And...

233
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,840
它还活着呢
it's still alive.

234
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,270
所以没问题了吧
Let's do this.

235
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,090
-霍华德呢  -招呼都懒得打吗
- Where's Howard? - No "Hi, Raj"?

236
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,690
也不问我今天过得怎么样
No "How are you, Raj?"

237
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,080
一开口就问另一个白人在哪儿
Just straight to "Where's the other white guy?"

238
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,430
抱歉
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,360
听着  我听说了点关于他的事
So, listen, I heard something about him.

240
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,100
你能保密吗
Can you keep it between us?

241
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,500
哎哟  八卦
Ooh, gossip.

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,870
我刚来这的时候  我以为你们美国人
When I first got here, I thought you Americans

243
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,570
真的只在冷水机旁说八卦呢
really gossiped around the water cooler.

244
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,540
所以我去那边转悠了大概一个月
So I hung out there for, like, a month,

245
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,700
但我唯一听到的八卦就是  有个诡异的家伙
but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy

246
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,420
总是围着冷水机瞎转悠
hanging out by the water cooler.

247
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,990
伯纳黛特想要签婚前协议
Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

248
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,710
这太丢脸了  他肯定会悲痛欲绝的
Oh, that's a shame-- he's gonna be devastated.

249
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,820
我对处理这种情况没有经验
I never know what to do in these situations.

250
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,220
我该给他点建议吗
Should I give him a heads-up?

251
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,760
我给你的建议就跟我看真人秀《单身汉》的一样
Hmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice

252
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,900
当那些男人拿着玫瑰不知送给谁时  我就会嚷
I yell at the TV when the Bachelor's handing out roses.

253
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,580
随心所愿
Follow your heart.

254
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,830
快瞧瞧
Check it out.

255
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,570
看这份超大米花糖
Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat!

256
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,580
价钱一样哦
Same price.

257
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,980
霍华德  我得告诉你点事
Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.

258
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,810
我知道  结婚前不该吃这些
I know, it's not on my wedding diet.

259
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,540
我不在乎
I don't care.

260
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,550
听着
Uh, l-listen, I...

261
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,930
我听说伯纳黛特想要你签婚前协议
heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a prenup.

262
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,460
婚前协议
A prenup?

263
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
你要怎么办
What are you gonna do?

264
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,670
我不知道
I... don't know.

265
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,200
随心所愿
Follow your heart.

266
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,230
其实  这也没什么
You know what, it's... not a big deal.

267
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,510
她赚的钱比我多
She makes more money than me.

268
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,140
她想要保护自己的经济利益
She wants to protect her financial interests.

269
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,950
这完全合理
It's completely reasonable.

270
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,390
很好  你这心态不错
Good. That's a healthy attitude.

271
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,390
其实  这对我们两个都好
Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us.

272
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,890
我也有要保护的财产
I have assets to protect, too.

273
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,250
是吗  比如呢
Like what?

274
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,240
我有些很珍贵的漫画书
I've got some rare comic books.

275
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,780
那辆卫士摩托的贷款也快还清了
The Vespa's almost paid off.

276
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,800
我和妈在西奈山优先订了一个双人墓
And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai

277
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,970
就在那个演过《三人行》里罗柏先生的人旁边
right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on <i>Three's Company.</i>

278
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,060
罗柏先生死了吗
Mr. Roper's dead?!

279
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,450
你怎么能人家在毫无心理准备下说出来呢
You can't just spring that on a guy!

280
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,750
给
Here you go.

281
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,620
这件实验室里的玻璃器皿
This is now the only lab

282
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,320
可是独一无二  因为它们被个有双博士学位
with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates

283
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,970
卡尔·萨根  美国著名天文学家和科学家
和一张卡尔·萨根签过的禁止令的人洗过
and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.

284
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,600
有肥皂泡  重新洗
Soap spots. Wash 'em again.

285
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,490
胡说八道
Y... You're being ridiculous!

286
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,560
这些器皿彻底洗干净了
Those are perfectly clean.

287
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,500
谢尔顿  这个量杯盛过
Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid

288
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,740
死于梅毒的大象的脑脊液
from an elephant that died of syphilis.

289
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,370
如果真的彻底干净了
If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,

290
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,720
你敢拿去倒水喝吗
drink from it.

291
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,460
生物学家好刻薄
Biologists are mean.

292
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,280
好了  这个任务可能有点超出了你的能力
All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley.

293
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,160
我要你数清这些培养皿里的细菌孢子
I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.

294
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,320
那个清洁剂有问题
There was something wrong with that detergent.

295
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,080
有好多泡泡
That was way too bubbly.

296
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,290
-我想是吧  -我准备写一封
- I'm sure it was. - I intend to write

297
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,590
措辞强力的投诉信给肥皂公司
that soap company a strongly worded letter.

298
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,600
好吧  不错  现在开始数吧
Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.

299
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
知道这地方需要什么东西吗
You know what this place needs?

300
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,250
建议箱
A suggestion box.

301
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,780
三百六十六
366...

302
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,740
三百六十七
367...

303
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,180
怎么样了
How's it going?

304
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,520
你是说数数吗
How's <i>counting</i> going?

305
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,970
我还在上幼儿园的时候
When I was in kindergarten,

306
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,940
我在学校才艺展示上背了圆周率小数点后的一千位
I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show.

307
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,270
-我想这难不倒我  -很好
- I think I got this.  - Great.

308
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,730
我擦
Aw, nuts!

309
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,010
一
One...

310
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,020
这太可笑了
This is preposterous!

311
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,640
你一直让我做这些工作
I think you're giving me these tasks

312
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,280
因为你担心我要是做了有意义的工作
because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do,

313
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,610
我就会超过你
I'll show you up.

314
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,410
真的吗  你就这么想的吗
Really? Is that what you think?

315
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,950
对  我就是这么想的
Yes, that's what I think.

316
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,230
而我这么超级聪明的人  这没准就是事实
And I'm super smart, so it's probably true.

317
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,210
我在神经生物学领域锻炼了12年
Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years.

318
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,460
而你只来了3小时
You've been here for three hours,

319
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,550
其中1小时还花在厕所里了
and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.

320
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
不好意思  我没上过这里的厕所
I'm sorry! It takes me a while

321
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
总得花点时间来熟悉熟悉
to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

322
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,600
谢尔顿  我给你的都是最简单的工作
Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do,

323
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,770
你还一件都没有做对
and you haven't done one of them right.

324
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,640
也许是因为这些工作没有挑战
Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged.

325
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,340
就和爱因斯坦数学不及格一样
It's the same reason Einstein failed math.

326
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,300
也许数学对他来说泡泡[0]太多了
Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.

327
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,550
你觉得切割大脑需要技术含量吗
You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain?

328
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,530
这和在三明治店做的没什么两样
They could do the same thing at any Quiznos.

329
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,220
而且他们还会给我吐司面包呢
And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.

330
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,140
好吧  聪明鬼
Okay, smart guy.

331
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,990
我正要切除蓝斑核
I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,

332
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,130
这是份超精细的工作
which is incredibly delicate work.

333
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,020
你来吧
Have at it.

334
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,200
好啊
All right.

335
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,090
我对这种灰白质可熟悉了
I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.

336
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,340
蓝斑核
Locus coeruleus.

337
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,620
蓝斑核
Locus coeruleus.

338
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,020
你猜得差不多了  这确实是脑子里面的
You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain.
You're getting warmer一般用在猜谜或游戏活动中

339
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,120
希望你的手有够稳
Hope your hands are steady.

340
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,150
这活儿细如发丝
It's the width of a single hair.

341
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,470
但这不过是普通的生物学
But this is just biology,

342
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,540
肯定难不倒向你这样的天才
so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.

343
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,270
那是当然  你要知道在物理学领域
It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics,

344
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,960
我们研究的粒子小到
we work with particles so small,

345
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
可以嘲笑你们的蓝斑体型过胖
they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus.

346
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,100
就是说  你们家蓝斑闲坐家中
I.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house,

347
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,160
那家里简直水泄不通
it sits <i>around</i> the house.

348
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,590
紧张了吗  库珀博士
Oh... are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?

349
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,870
没有
No.

350
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,510
你所看到的
What you see

351
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,930
是我满怀信心的颤抖
is a man trembling with confidence.

352
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,560
蓝斑通常都会出这么多血吗
Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?

353
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,380
不  但你的手指会
No. But your thumb does.

354
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,600
天啊
Oh, dear.

355
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,480
哎哟  就你还想当生物学家呢
Yeah, <i>you're</i> a biologist.

356
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,840
你来这干嘛
What are you doing here?

357
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,030
我在度假
I'm on vacation.

358
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,800
按照社会惯例
Social convention dictates

359
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,030
我应该来当地酒吧放松一下
that I let my hair down at a local watering hole.

360
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,820
社会惯例就是个屁
Social convention is stupid.

361
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,410
你的手指怎么了
What happened to your thumb?

362
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,950
我有十个手指十个脚趾
I have ten fingers and ten toes.

363
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,860
要我每个指头的故事你都要听
If I tell you a story about each one of them,

364
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,930
那可得说上一整天  所以算了吧
we'll be here all day-- let's just move on.

365
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,090
要点什么
What can I get you?

366
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,670
既然我是在度假
Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation,

367
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,100
凤椰朗姆酒比较合适
uh, Pina Colada seems appropriate.
凤梨片椰奶和白色褐色朗姆酒
调制成的加勒比海特色鸡尾酒

368
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,840
多加凤梨片和鲜奶油
Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream,

369
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,080
再给双份樱桃和小伞
extra cherries, extra umbrellas,

370
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,180
还有  不要朗姆酒
and, uh, hold the rum.

371
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,310
记得别让我喝太多
Don't let me have too many of those.

372
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,550
您二位在这干嘛呀
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

373
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,710
我们都是大人  就该在吧台这喝酒
We're grown men; we drink at bars.

374
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,050
扯  胡扯
No and no.

375
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,260
你和伯纳黛特还好吧
Everything okay with you and Bernadette?

376
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
好啊  当然好
Oh, yeah, sure.

377
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,930
你和艾米呢  还好吗
You and Amy? Good?

378
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,970
好得不能再好了
Oh, better than good.

379
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,900
要知道  她们都会把生活中的每件事都发短信告诉我
You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.

380
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,630
我是不会签婚前协议的
I'm not signing a prenup.

381
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,490
好吧  霍华德·沃罗威茨  给我听着
All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up.

382
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,680
她给你什么你就签什么
You sign anything she puts in front of you,

383
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,510
因为你是世上最幸运的人
because you are the luckiest man alive.

384
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,410
要是失去了她
If you let her go,

385
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,020
你再也不可能找到像她这么好的
there is no way you can find anyone else--

386
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,180
我是代表全体女同胞说这话
speaking on behalf of all women,

387
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,150
你绝对不可能再找到  我们开会一致认同的
it is not gonna happen; we had a meeting.

388
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,540
还有你  一个成年人
And you, a grown man

389
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,950
-居然看到一点点血就晕倒  -拜托
- fainting at the sight of a little blood. - Excuse me,

390
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,450
这个伤口那是相当大
this is a fairly substantial wound.

391
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,450
你...
You...

392
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,910
艾米  艾米  艾米
Amy? Amy? Amy?

393
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,580
有何贵干
What do you want?

394
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,840
我希望能继续在你实验室里度假
I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory.

395
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,560
毕竟当初我预定了一整周
After all, I did book the whole week.

396
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,360
你真的以为就凭你昨天那样
Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here

397
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,220
还能轻易地回来这里吗
after the way you behaved yesterday?

398
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,530
昨天我那是身不由已
I was not myself.

399
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,390
因为手指失血过多
I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

400
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,030
这话可不算道歉
That's not an apology.

401
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,030
就你不觉得而已
That is your opinion.

402
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,910
我想听的是真正的道歉
I want a real apology.

403
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,430
-我很抱歉你没有能够...  -不对
- I'm sorry that you weren't able to... - No.

404
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,000
抱歉我的天赋...
...that my genius...

405
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,370
不对
No.

406
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,930
抱歉那肥皂太...
...that the soap was...

407
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,380
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

408
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,110
好吧
Fine.

409
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,110
对不起
Sorry.

410
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,680
我原谅你
You're forgiven.

411
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,000
你若真想留下来  就先去洗那些烧杯
Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers.

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,870
昨天就没洗干净
They're still dirty from yesterday.

413
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,150
明年度假我要去"未来世界"玩
Next year I'm going to EPCOT.
美国佛州迪士尼的主题乐园

414
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,090
你在生我气吗
Are you mad at me?

415
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,550
不  我没有生你气
No. I'm not mad at you.

416
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,130
我只是...
I just...

417
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,350
希望你直接跟我说
wish you would have come to me,

418
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,290
而不是让我从某些书呆口中听到
so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.

419
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,260
那我们该怎么办
So, what are we gonna do?

420
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,820
你真的想让我签婚前协议吗
You really want me to sign a prenup?

421
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,410
我不知道
I don't know.

422
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,870
虽然我爸在这点态度上非常强硬
My dad's pretty insistent on it, though.

423
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,110
何不让我跟你爸谈谈  来个男人之间的对话
Why don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?

424
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,680
真的吗  那太好了
Really? Oh, that'd be so great!

425
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,450
就这么说定了
Done.

426
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,010
我先警告你一些注意事项
I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things.

427
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,450
虽然我爸已经从警局退休了
Even though he's retired from the police force,

428
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,890
他还是配着枪
he still carries his gun.

429
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,610
但别担心  他不会开枪的
But don't worry, he won't shoot it.

430
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,840
更多是想彰显自己时髦
It's more of a fashion statement.

431
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,500
好的
Okay.

432
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,760
为安全起见  你跟他谈的时候
And just to be safe, when you talk to him,

433
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,130
千万别提起吉米·卡特  园艺师
don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners,
吉米·卡特:美国第39届总统  2002年诺贝尔和平奖获得者

434
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,110
外国人  同性恋者  西恩·潘
foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn,

435
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,540
第二次梵蒂冈大公会议  枪支管理法  有机食品
Vatican II, gun control, organic food,

436
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,690
指定打击规则  资源回收  或你是犹太人的事实
the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you're Jewish.

437
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,060
明白  明白
Got it, got it.

438
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,960
把这单子电邮给我吧
Will you e-mail me that list?

439
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,460
所以要当心的是
So the thing to watch for,

440
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,720
若他冲你吼  那就没事
if he's shouting at you, you're okay,

441
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
但若他开始变得沉默
but if he starts to get real quiet,

442
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,730
千万别跟他目光接触  有多快就跑多块
leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact.

443
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,190
切勿跑直线  要之字形逃命
Not in a straight line-- throw some zigs and zigs in there.

444
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,510
反正这事也不是迫在眉睫
You know, this isn't that pressing.

445
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,770
不如等五月份我再找他谈吧
Why don't I talk to him about it in May.

446
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,960
五月你就上国际空间站了
In May you're gonna be on the International Space Station.

447
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,760
空间站也有电话的嘛
They got a phone.
