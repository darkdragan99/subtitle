1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,350
嗨  谢尔顿是不是又改了无线网的密码
Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,110
嗯  现在是"佩妮蹭我们吃的
Yeah, it's "Penny already eats our food.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,560
无线网让她自己装去"
She can pay for Wi-Fi."

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,600
没空格
No spaces.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
好吧
Okay.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,320
既然你们都阻止不了我来蹭吃的
If you can't get me to stop eating your food,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,070
你凭什么觉得能阻止我蹭无线网呢
what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,620
我相信你还是会浪子回头的
I believe that you're capable of great change.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,030
就像我当初终于让你不再说"情伦节"一样
Like when I finally got you to stop saying "Valentimes Day""

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,950
有件很诡异的事儿想听吗
You want to hear something weird?

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,530
当然
Sure.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,390
在2000年
In the year 2000,

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,800
由黑人组织的一个滑稽篮球队  巡回作表演赛
教皇约翰·保罗二世当选为哈勒姆环球队荣誉队员
Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,740
你这说的都是些啥啊
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,130
你问佩妮想不想听一些奇怪的事情啊
You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,770
没错  因为我有件很诡异的事情要跟她讲
Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,230
我还以为这是个游戏呢
I thought it was a game.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,020
你的怪事是啥
What's yours?

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,170
这个哥们儿  吉米·斯贝克曼
There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman,

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,410
当年高中的时候老欺负我来着
who used to torment me in high school.

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,380
他在Facebook上给我发了条信息
He sent me a message through Facebook.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,580
他就在本市  想找我喝两杯
He's in town and wants to have drinks.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,820
佩妮  如果这是个游戏  你有如下选择
Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,510
来自老熟人的一封电邮
An e-mail from an old acquaintance,

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,940
还是世界上最大宗教机构的领袖
or the head of one of the largest religious institutions

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,680
哈勒姆环球队的队歌
在《Sweet Georgia Brown》的歌声中扣篮  挑一个
in the world slam dunking to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,410
选一个吧  不然他不会闭嘴的
Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,570
我选打篮球的教皇
Basketball Pope.

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,030
这才靠谱嘛
And that's how it's done.

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
那个欺负你的家伙你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do about your bully?

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,490
-要去见他吗  -不知道啊
- Are you gonna see him? - I don't know.

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,660
这就是那个往你的夏威夷潘趣饮料里撒尿的家伙吗
Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,570
不是  那是另外一个
No, that was a different guy.

34
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,840
是不是这个家伙当初提你内裤太过用力
Was he the one who wedgied you so hard,

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,260
以至于你一个蛋蛋上提错位
your testicle reascended,

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,960
你的整个圣诞节假期
and you spent your whole Christmas break

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,470
都在等它慢慢滑下来
waiting for it to come back down?

38
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,490
不是  那又是一个人
No, that was a different, different guy.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,740
那他是不是那个拿你的脑袋敲核桃的家伙
Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?

40
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,270
不是
No.

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,490
想到了想到了
Oh, oh, oh.

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,470
他是不是那个让你吃自己手毛的家伙
Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,790
不是  不过其实
No, but, actually,

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,530
让我吃毛的是这哥们儿的妹妹
that was this guy's sister.

45
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,990
好吧  你觉得他想干嘛呢
All right, well, what do you think he wants?

46
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,250
不知道
I don't know.

47
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,130
你看哈  圣诞假期快到了
You know, the holidays are just around the corner.

48
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,510
也许他想看看能不能
Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
把另一个蛋蛋也给弄错位了
the other testicle up there.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,550
我都跟你说了  不是这哥们
I told you. That was a different guy.

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,700
唉  真可惜  本来可以
Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,900
纽约时代广场新年夜保留节目
零点倒数时会有一个球掉下来
在新年夜等着蛋蛋掉下来的
New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,010
生活大爆炸第五季第十一集

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,680
凌晨两点钟  你还不睡在干嘛呢
It's 2:00 a.m. What are you doing up?

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,270
从斯德哥尔摩直播的诺贝尔颁奖仪式
Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,730
是啊  你想看看
Sure. You want to see

57
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,600
科学家们今年都爱穿些啥
what all the scientists are wearing this year.

58
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,340
你看看这些人
Look at these men.

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,750
他们成功赢得了国际科学界的最高奖项
They've managed to win the top science prize in the world

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,610
可是他们对早期宇宙膨胀的
with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings

61
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,710
量子基础的理解
of the expansion of the early universe

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,680
还不如傻子懂得多
than God gave a goose.

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,060
你该看看的  莱纳德
You should pay attention, Leonard.

64
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,340
哪天搞不好上台领奖的是你
Someday this could be you up there.

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,590
多谢
Thanks.

66
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,980
那你为啥醒了呢
So, what's got you up?

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
蛤肉吃坏肚子了吗
Did you have a bad clam?

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,650
我都没吃蛤肉
I didn't have clams.

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,690
我又没有时刻盯着你
I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,600
谁知道你都干了些啥呢
I don't know what you do.

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,130
还不是因为吉米·斯贝克曼的事儿
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.

72
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,880
我犹豫到底要不要去见他
I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not.

73
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,100
当然也许是
Of course that might be

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,480
因为我上次碰到他的时候
because the last time I ran into him,

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,700
他强迫我拿鞋带当牙线用
he made me floss with my own shoelaces.

76
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,290
这次记得穿路夫鞋[没有鞋带]
Wear loafers.

77
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,880
加州大学伯克利分校教授
因观察超新星而发现宇宙加速膨胀获2011年诺贝尔物理学奖
你看看索尔·珀尔马特
Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there,

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,610
紧紧地抓着奖杯
clutching that Nobel Prize.

79
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,450
你怎么了啊  索尔
What's the matter, Saul?

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,980
怕人偷还是怕人抢啊
You afraid someone's going to steal it?

81
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,520
就像你偷了爱因斯坦的宇宙常数一样一样对吧
Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?

82
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,680
你知道吗
You know what?

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
我受够了总是害怕这家伙了
I am tired of living in fear of this guy.

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,980
我要去见他  然后把所有
I'm gonna go see him and finally say

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,620
该在高中时告诉他的话都说出来
all the things I should have said in high school.

86
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,800
比如  "找个跟你块头差不多欺负看看"
You know, "Pick on someone your own size"

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,860
"你没跟我妈上过床"
"You did not have sex with my mother."

88
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,950
还有"嗯  我还真就知道我为啥在打自己"
And "Yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself."

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,510
珀尔马特现在在跟瑞典国王握手了
Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the king's hand.

90
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,970
小心你的手表哦  国王陛下
Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf.

91
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,140
没准儿就被他给顺走了
He might have lifted it.

92
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,770
我好喜欢这条裙子
I love this dress.

93
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,500
为啥从来没见你穿过呢
How come I never see you wear it?

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,580
因为我一直把它当上衣穿
'Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt.

95
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,050
霍华德今晚在干嘛
So, what's Howard doing tonight?

96
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,100
他们都一起去见那个小时候欺负莱纳德的恶霸了
Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.

97
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,360
有意思
Oh, terrific.

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,890
高中的四分卫对阵四个数学呆子
High school quarterback against four mathletes.

99
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,400
等莱纳德回来的时候
When Leonard gets back,

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,040
血清素含量低时更具有攻击性
我想检测一下他体内的血清素水平
I'd love to check his serotonin levels.

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,330
你觉得他会让我抽他一管血吗
Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?

102
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,400
他不喜欢针头
Hmm, he's not crazy about needles,

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,610
但你要是让他去跑步
but if you get him to go jogging,

104
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,240
他的鼻子就会自动喷血了
it'll just pour out of his nose.

105
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,720
我肯定不敢去见
I don't think I can meet the girl

106
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,140
一直欺负我的人
who was always mean to me.

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
泰咪·勃妮克
Tammy Bodnick.

108
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
有一次上体育课
One time while I was in gym class,

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,550
她偷了我的所有衣服
she stole all my clothes

110
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,070
只在我柜子里留了一件精灵装
and left an elf costume in my locker.

111
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,690
太悲剧了
Oh, that's awful.

112
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,400
最悲剧的是  精灵装太大
Worst part was, it was too big.

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,450
这不算什么
That's nothing.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
九年级的时候  那些女生在我的护手霜里下洛盖尼(生发剂)
In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,060
不到六个月  花名就满天飞了
Within six months, the nicknames began to fly.

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,290
最伤人的一个应该是猩猩手福勒
I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

117
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,690
两个可怜的小姑娘
Wow. You poor thing.

118
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,580
-你呢  -我啊
- What about you? - Oh.

119
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,720
不知道哦  我们学校挺好的
I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place.

120
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,850
没有什么恶霸
We didn't really have bullies.

121
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,720
不是吧  从来没有人给别人取花名
Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
捉弄别人  在长毛的指节上粘口香糖
or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
搞得校医只能用花生酱才能弄下来?
so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?

124
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,500
没有  我们不会那样
No, we weren't really like that.

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,050
我们虽然会戏弄对方
I mean, look, we played pranks on each other,

126
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,400
但都是闹着玩的
but it was never mean.

127
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,130
比如有个女生  凯西·盖格
Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger,

128
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,670
考试经常得高分  于是我们蒙上她的眼睛
got really good grades, so we blindfolded her,

129
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,730
把她五花大绑到玉米地  留她在那过夜
tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.

130
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,410
天啊  太过分了
Oh, my God, that's awful.

131
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,840
才怪  好玩着呢  大家都笑了
No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

132
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,200
凯西·盖格笑了吗
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

133
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
不知道  很难说
Uh, probably. It's hard to say.

134
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,040
她嘴里塞满了玉米穗
She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

135
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,650
谁能想到
Who would have thought

136
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,360
当年的毛手福勒现在变成恶霸的闺蜜
Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?

137
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,530
什么  我才不是恶霸
What? I was not a bully.

138
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,470
可听着感觉你以前是
Kind of sounds like you were.

139
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,140
说不定还是个头头
And maybe a felon.

140
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,320
嘘  你想去玉米地过夜吗
Shh. That's how you wind up in a cornfield.

141
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,710
那边那个是他吗
Is that him over there?

142
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,520
不是
No.

143
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,220
那个呢
How about that guy?

144
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,760
他貌似很恨你
He looks like he'd hate you.

145
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,360
你们其实不用来  我自己能搞定
You know, I can really do this by myself.

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
兄弟  我们是来挺你的
Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,310
才怪  你们只是来看我
No, you're not. You're here to see

148
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,400
会不会被他扯内裤盖到头上
if I get my underwear pulled over my head.

149
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,650
你居然穿内裤来  你个白痴
You wore underwear? You fool.

150
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,540
你想好怎么跟他说了吗
So, have you figured out what you're going to say to him?

151
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,530
废话  他以前在学校这么欺负我
You bet. I am going to make him apologize

152
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,980
我要让我向我道歉
for all the crap he pulled on me in school.

153
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,430
这单子真长
That's quite a list.

154
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,280
我看不懂你写的字
I can't read your handwriting.

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,440
这是什么字啊
What's that word?

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,830
"阴囊"
"Scrotum."

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,570
那这个呢
What's that one?

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,990
"钉"
Uh, "Stapled."

159
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,990
莱纳德
Leonard.

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
嗨
Oh, hi.

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
我的天哪  老兄  好久不见
Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

162
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,920
好久不见  吉米  这几位是
Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is

163
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,730
谢尔顿  拉杰  霍华德
Sheldon and Raj and Howard.

164
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,420
你们好  喂  来瓶啤酒
Hi. Fellas... Hey, can I get a beer?

165
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,110
哇  瞧瞧你
Wow. Look at you.

166
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,820
小不点莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

167
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
我听说你现在是大科学家了
I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,120
这就开始讽刺了  真伤人
And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

169
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,340
我现在马马虎虎啦
I'm doing okay, I guess.

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,710
不是吧  我在网上看到
Okay? Come on, I read online

171
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,450
你现在是一所大学的物理学家
you're a physicist at a university,

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,890
你还得了奖呢
you won some medal.

173
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,550
纽科姆奖
The Newcomb medal.

174
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,110
对  恭喜恭喜
Yeah, congratulations.

175
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,610
恭喜?
Congratulations?

176
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,320
纽科姆奖哦  拜托
The Newcomb medal? Oh, please.

177
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,550
那在科学界相当于
That's the scientific equivalent

178
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,020
小学作业本上得了朵小红花
of a smiley face sticker on your homework.

179
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,840
在我看来挺威风的
From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.

180
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,900
老天  我们就站在这里
Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here

181
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,240
听他用言语羞辱莱纳德吗
and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?

182
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
喂  我也赢过纽科姆奖
Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.

183
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,500
我说得很清楚啦
My point.

184
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,910
你们真该看看这家伙小时候的样子
You should have seen this guy back in the day.

185
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,650
他个子小得  搁哪里都能塞进去
Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere.

186
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,380
柜子啦  垃圾桶啦
Lockers, trash cans.

187
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,650
老兄  你怎么钻进那个背包的
Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?

188
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,200
功劳不全在我
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,340
-你可是帮了大忙  -对
- You helped a lot. - Yeah.

190
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,450
咱俩简直就是个搞笑队伍
We were practically a comedy team.

191
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,210
就像黑死病席卷欧洲一样
Like the Black Death and Europe.

192
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,730
吉米  我很好奇你为什么想见我
Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.

193
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,280
是这样的
Okay, here it is.

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,000
我想到一个绝佳的赚钱点子
I have this great money-making idea.

195
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,130
现在只差一个机械行家来完成
I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.

196
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,990
严格来说  霍华德才是机械行家
Technically, Howard's the gear head.

197
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,150
莱纳德只是低级的激光操作员
Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey.

198
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,230
什么赚钱点子
What's the idea?

199
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,440
这点子不能外传啊
This is just between us, right?

200
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,630
-行  -好
- Right. - Okay.

201
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,910
你们觉得一副能让任何电影
What do you think about a pair of glasses

202
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,760
变得立体的眼镜怎么样
that makes any movie you want into 3D?

203
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,940
那太帅了
That sounds amazing.

204
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,970
90年代家庭歌舞剧
我第一个要看的电影就是《安妮》
First movie I'm watching-- Annie.

205
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
这种眼镜怎么做
How exactly would these glasses work?

206
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,500
我要是知道还用得着找一个书呆子吗
How the hell should I know? That's why I need a nerd.

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,400
我觉得这玩意儿行不通
I don't think something like that's even possible.

208
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,370
拜托  你一定有办法的
Aw, come on, you can figure it out.

209
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,100
你是我认识的最聪明的人了
You're like the smartest guy I've ever known.

210
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,070
最聪明的  好吧
The smartest...?! All right,

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
我可能对挖苦讽刺什么的不在行
you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,

212
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,340
可就连我都知道  你该用"出色"而不是"聪明"
but even I know that was a doozy.

213
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,370
莱纳德  你不能永远活在对这个人的恐惧之下
Leonard, you can't live in fear of this man forever.

214
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,990
谢尔顿  我自己能处理
Sheldon, I got this.

215
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,530
你显然不能
You clearly don't.

216
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,890
我这个没骨气的朋友没胆量说的是
What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say

217
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,960
你是一个利用了
is you're a terrible person

218
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,290
他的矮小
who took advantage of his tiny size,

219
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,430
身体协调能力缺乏
his uncoordinated nature and

220
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,540
和先天男子气概缺失的恶人
his congenital lack of masculinity.

221
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,050
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

222
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,140
莱纳德  在精神上我还是挺喜欢你的  兄弟
Leonard, I platonically love you, man,

223
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,980
但是请你面对现实  你就是一团糟
but face it, you're a mess.

224
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,220
我都糊涂了
I don't understand.

225
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,520
我想他要说的是  或许在高中时
I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school

226
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,090
你有点欺负我
you picked on me a little bit.

227
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,920
有点儿
A little bit?

228
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,170
这家伙把好时之吻巧克力用超能胶粘在你的乳头上
The man super glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.

229
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,460
有意思的是  高中时期你的乳头
That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses

230
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,960
要的可不是巧克力的吻
you want on your nipples.

231
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,670
那张纸是什么
What is that?

232
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,770
这张单子上列满了你对莱纳德做过的可憎行径
This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard.

233
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,500
其中肯定有一项导致他
One of which is certainly the cause

234
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,770
直到十几岁了还尿床
of him wetting his bed well into his teens.

235
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,340
十四岁不算是  算了
14 is not... Aw, never mind.

236
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,220
这个是什么字
What's this word?

237
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,220
"南希"
"Nancy".

238
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,190
你管我叫"南希"叫了三年
You called me Nancy for three years.

239
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,640
你真该好好练练字了
You really need to work on your penmanship.

240
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,090
天啊  我
Oh, man, I...

241
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

242
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,090
我一直以为我们都乐在其中
I always thought we were just having some fun.

243
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,340
我可一点都乐不起来
It wasn't fun for me.

244
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,370
你用词太客气了  莱纳德
You're being too kind, Leonard.

245
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,190
你把他给毁了
You ruined him.

246
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,880
走吧  伙计们
Come on, guys.

247
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,010
你刚才还真厉害  兄弟
That was pretty badass, dude.

248
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,750
我向来帮助弱者
I help the weak.

249
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,100
又一次证明了我就是蝙蝠侠在世
It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman.

250
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,520
澄清一下  害我尿床的人不是吉米
Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

251
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,500
那都是我妈害的
That one has my mother written all over it.

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,960
总之我很抱歉
Anyway, I'm really sorry

253
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,320
高中的时候一直笑你口吃
I made fun of your stutter in high school.

254
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,990
你干得很好
You're doing great.

255
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,190
天啊  等她说完费死劲了
Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

256
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,970
好吧  抱歉让你难过了  再见
Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye.

257
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,710
没人想听我道歉
No one wants to hear my apologies.

258
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,710
我认为你不该在电话上道歉
I think your mistake is doing it over the phone.

259
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,950
如果她们能看着你那无辜的大眼睛  铁定会被你融化的
If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.

260
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,520
佩妮  你过去做过什么都不重要
Penny, it doesn't matter what you did in the past.

261
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,180
重要的是你现在是个好人
You're a good person now.

262
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,680
你说得倒是容易
That's easy for you to say.

263
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,380
别人又没管你叫"婊婊婊婊婊婊子"
You weren't just called a "B-b-b-b-bitch".

264
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,630
也许你可以通过做善事来减轻你的负罪感
Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism.

265
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,090
你是哪个词没听懂
Which word's tripping you up?

266
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,980
"减轻"还是"负罪感"
"Assuage", or "altruism"?

267
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,440
俩都没懂
Both.

268
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,210
通过帮助别人  让你的心好过一点
You'll feel better by doing something nice for someone.

269
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,260
-其实我是懂的  -我从没怀疑过你的实力
- I actually knew that.  - I never doubted you.

270
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,530
每隔一个星期我都会去市中心的一家汤店去帮忙
Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.

271
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,250
这不行
Ooh, I can't do that.

272
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,750
如果我站在一锅冒热气的汤前  我的头发就会全炸开
If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing!

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,020
我还能干点别的什么
What else could I do?

274
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,460
还有仁爱之家活动
There's Habitat for Humanity --

275
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,890
给穷人盖房子
building houses for the poor.

276
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,140
拜托  我自己都没有房子
Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house --

277
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,550
又何德何能给别人盖呢
I'm going to build one for someone else?

278
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,800
那捐赠你的一些衣服怎么样
How about donating some of your clothes?

279
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,670
天啊  这太完美了
Oh, my God, that's perfect.

280
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,970
因为我有太多不穿的衣服了
'Cause I have so many clothesI don't wear,

281
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,950
衣橱都装不下了
and they're just taking up space,

282
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,060
我每次逛街还总爱买
and I go shopping to buy more stuff

283
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,240
新衣服都没地方放了
and I have no place to put it.

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,710
这下我的麻烦就都解决了
This will totally fix that.

285
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,080
那助人为乐呢
What about helping people?

286
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,960
外加助人为乐
And helping people.

287
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,370
这是你的可可
Here's your cocoa.

288
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,990
-你放的是半脱脂奶不是全脂奶吧  -没错
- Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?  - Yes.

289
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,390
-精确加热到了83.89度了吗  -没错
- Heated to precisely 183 degrees?  - Yes.

290
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,290
正好七块小棉花糖  不多不少吗
Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?

291
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,780
你运气好  多给你一块
You got one for good luck.

292
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,260
我去开门
I'll get it.

293
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,730
我运气好  多给我一块
One for good luck.

294
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,910
这数学水平跟普林斯顿大学有一拼
Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.

295
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,130
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

296
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,510
我来道歉  就用订书机订你的蛋蛋
I want to apologize for...stapling your balls and...

297
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
把你脱光了丢进女生更衣室
...throwing you naked in the girls' locker room,

298
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,580
还有把胡萝卜塞到你裤子里向你道歉
stuffing that parrot down your pants.

299
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,720
这个是什么字
What's this word?

300
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,470
-"泻药"  -没错
- "Laxative".  - Oh, right.

301
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,160
初中毕业舞会
Junior prom.

302
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,450
那样做太过分了  伙计
That was not cool, man.

303
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,660
我真的非常非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry.

304
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,970
真的吗
Really?

305
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,740
是啊  我只希望你能原谅我
Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.

306
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,170
好啊
Yeah.

307
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,460
我想我原谅你了
Sure, I guess.

308
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,770
你真是个大好人
You're a beautiful guy.

309
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,580
谢谢  吉米
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

310
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,620
好了  我该走了
Okay, I got to go.

311
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,080
你还能开车吗
Are you okay to drive?

312
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
当然  我喝醉了开得更好
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk.

313
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,890
酒精让人注意力更集中
You know, it makes you pay attention.

314
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,730
不行不行  进来  喝杯咖啡先
No, no, no, come on in. I'll make you a cup of coffee.

315
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,060
-不打扰吗  -不会
- I wouldn't be imposing? - No.

316
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,270
当然会
Yes.

317
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,440
谢尔顿  他现在不能开车
Sheldon, we can't let him drive.

318
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
那就拿走他的车钥匙  让他跟其他醉鬼一起
Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
去大街上游荡去呗
with the other drunks.

320
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,470
刚介绍过的  谢尔顿  拉杰和霍华德
You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.

321
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
没啥印象
Not really, no.

322
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,750
人生如戏啊  莱纳德
It's funny, huh, Leonard?

323
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,650
学校里  我是赢家你是输家
Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.

324
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,720
现在正好相反
And now we're reversed.

325
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,150
你成了赢家
You're the winner.

326
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,040
赢家居然连一杯像样的可可都做不好
You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.

327
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,060
-我用下洗手间可以吗  -当然  就在走廊后
- You mind if I use your bathroom? - Yeah, just back there.

328
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,500
感觉如何呀
How about that?

329
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,950
这么多年后  欺负你的高中恶霸
After all these years, your big bad high school bully

330
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,450
终于跟你道歉了
finally apologizes.

331
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,240
真好啊  恢复了我对
Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith

332
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,420
人性本善的信心
in the basic goodness of people.

333
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,980
知道什么才是真的好吗
You know what would be nice?

334
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,920
什么
What's that?

335
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,990
可以将吉米看作
As a symbolic gesture

336
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,640
多年来欺负我们的所有恶霸的象征
to all the bullies who've tormented us for years,

337
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,840
我们先引狼入室  然后趁他入睡杀了他
we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him.

338
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,820
我是说这样很好  不是说真要这么做
I said it would be nice-- I didn't say we should do it.

339
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,650
我觉得自己就像特蕾莎修女
I feel just like Mother Teresa.
因其一生奉献于解救贫困而获诺贝尔和平奖

340
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,440
除了童贞那部分
Except for the virgin part.
特蕾莎修女是终身职修女 毕生未婚

341
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,340
姐的早就奉献出去了
That ship sailed a long time ago.

342
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,270
我觉得特蕾莎修女会先把衣服洗干净
I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.

343
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,030
是啊  但愿她去洗衣房
Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room

344
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,090
不用走整整五层楼
wasn't down five flights of stairs.

345
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,950
付出真的比得到更幸福呢
You know, giving really is better than receiving.

346
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,730
我原本以为这是陈词滥调  但现在...
I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the...

347
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,200
居然有人扔掉这么好的牛仔裤
Look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.

348
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,660
是捐赠
Donated.

349
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,520
没错  捐赠给一个喜欢靴型牛仔裤的可怜女服务生
Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.

350
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,010
佩妮
Penny.

351
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,940
拜托  这我穿着绝对赞的呀
Come on, they would be so cute on me...

352
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,140
这裤子配这毛衣整好
They go great with this sweater!

353
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,280
特蕾莎修女可不会...
I don't think Mother Teresa...

354
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,950
这件真漂亮
Oh, that is adorable.

355
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,840
-莱纳德  -什么事
- Leonard. - Yeah.

356
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,380
为防再次留宿别人
In case it comes up again,

357
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,590
那家伙睡在我的位置上了
this right here is an imposition.

358
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,000
那我还能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,810
他需要地方过夜
He needed a place to sleep it off.

360
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,300
你太善良了
You're soft.

361
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,570
这世界将把你啃得尸骨无存
This world's going to chew you up and spit you out.

362
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,680
怎么有股炸玉米饼味
When did I have tacos?

363
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,650
早  吉米
Morning, Jimmy.

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,340
真的是炸玉米饼味
Oh, there it is, tacos.

365
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,370
我昨晚喝醉了
Man, I tied one on.

366
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,610
是啊
Yeah, you did.

367
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,190
是这样的  我很高兴再见到你
So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again.

368
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,230
还有谢谢你的道歉
And thanks for the apology.

369
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,890
什么道歉
What apology?

370
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,540
你为在学校里对我做的恶作剧道歉啊
For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.

371
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,550
天哪  你还在喋喋不休这些事
Geez, you're still harping on that?

372
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,240
真是个娘们
What a puss.

373
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,770
那是我的法式吐司
That's my French toast.

374
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,590
很好吃
It's good.

375
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,120
厨房的事你样样精通嘛  南希
You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.

376
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,370
我不想说  我早告诉过你了
I'm not going to say I told you so,

377
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,170
但我们本可以杀了他的
but we could have killed him.

378
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,370
我现在就杀了他
I might kill him right now.

379
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,910
黑暗骑士[蝙蝠侠]挺你
The Dark Knight has your back.

380
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,440
他吓坏了  不过还是挺你
He's scared, but he has your back.

381
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,120
吉米  你该走了
Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.

382
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,500
没问题  等我吃完
Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.

383
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,330
不行  你马上就给我出去
No, you're done. I want you out of my apartment right now.

384
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,030
说得好  神奇小子
Well said, Boy Wonder.

385
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
不然怎样
Or what?

386
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,420
别回答  有诈
Don't answer that. It's a trick question.

387
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,830
我可是上过当了
I speak from experience.

388
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,460
我不再怕你了  吉米
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Jimmy.

389
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,530
给我滚出去
Now get out!

390
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,250
你做到了  莱纳德  勇敢反抗了恶霸
You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.

391
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,780
没错  我为自己骄傲
Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself.

392
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,520
你觉得我们跑得过他吗
You think we can outrun him?

393
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,260
我不用跑得过他  只要跑得过你
I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.

394
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,120
这样做不大好吧
I don't feel good about this.

395
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,590
那就去车里呆着  别熄火
Then sit in the car and keep it running.

396
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,110
你说对了  又有新货到啦
You were right-- a whole new load.

397
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,530
出来吧  瑜伽装  妈妈需要瑜伽上装
Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.

398
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,800
看看吧  伯纳黛特  羊皮靴  你的尺码
Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.

399
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,870
天哪  真好看
God, they're cute.

400
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,070
为什么要这么好看啊
Oh, why did they have to be cute?

401
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,030
等等  等等  稍等一下
