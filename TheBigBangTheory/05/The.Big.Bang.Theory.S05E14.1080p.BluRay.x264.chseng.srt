00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,250
大家好
Hello,

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,810
我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,450
欢迎收看由谢尔顿·库珀出品的
and welcome to the premiere episode

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,480
《有趣的旗帜》之首播集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,060
在接下来的五十二周  我们将一起探索
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,010
旗帜学的奇妙世界
the dynamic world of vexillology.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,200
等一下  库博士
Hang on, Dr. C.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,020
旗帜学是什么
What's vexillology?

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,030
旗帜学就是研究旗帜的
Vexillology is the study of flags.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,070
真棒
Cool.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,410
我想我又长见识了
I think I just learned something.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,830
-你觉得有趣吗  -当然
- Did you have fun doing it? - I'll say.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,550
这个节目具有两面性  趣味性和知识性
Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,680
就如同这面两面的州旗
not unlike the only two-sided state flag--

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,300
一面是俄勒冈洲
Oregon.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,760
瞧
Oh, look.
俄勒冈州该州以喜栖息于水边挖穴而居的海狸作为象征
故有海狸州的别称

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,740
你好  海狸先生
Hello, Mr. Beaver.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,820
在接下来的节目里  我们会回答一些热门问题
In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions:

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
唯一一面不是长方形的旗帜是什么
What's the only non-rectangular flag?

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,910
在旗帜上出现最多的动物是什么
What animal appears most often on flags?

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,010
在旗帜上出现第二多的动物是什么
What animal appears second most often on flags?

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,930
等等
And more.

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,800
太棒了
Sweet!

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,280
你为什么挥白旗
Why are you waving a white flag?

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,580
因为太欢乐了
I'm surrendering...

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,230
我投降了
to fun.

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,360
今天《有趣的旗帜》的内容并不有趣
Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun,

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,730
但十分重要
but it is important.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
旗帜第一课  要学会如何拿
"Flags: you gotta know how to hold 'em,

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,380
如何叠
you gotta know how to fold 'em."

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,430
那我们先开始认识旗帜的结构
Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,590
这边是吊孔  用来...
This edge is the hoist, and it's used to...

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,910
抱歉  借过一下
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,100
停
Cut.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,710
你没看到我们在拍吗
Did you not see we are rolling?

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,980
抱歉  我要和佩妮一起吃晚饭
Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny.

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,180
我得赶紧出门
I have to get out of here.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,930
而我满脑子的旗帜知识
And I have flag knowledge

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,670
我也得让它们赶紧出来
that I have to get out of here!

40
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,350
你没事吧
You okay?

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,380
没事  就是有点生气
No, I'm a little rattled.

42
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,520
美国南北战争在萨姆特要塞打响
但就像萨姆特要塞的旗帜  我还坚守着呢
But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here.

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,160
第二遍
And... take two.

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,120
大家好
Hello.

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,290
我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

46
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,850
欢迎收看由谢尔顿·库珀出品的
and welcome to the premiere episode

47
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,930
《有趣的旗帜》之首播集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,530
在接下来的五十二周  我们将一起探索
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore

49
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,000
旗帜学的奇妙世界
the dynamic world of vexillology.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,210
等一下  库珀博士
Hang on, Dr. Cooper.

51
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,220
旗帜学是什么
What's vexillology?

52
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,160
旗帜学就是...
Vexillology is...

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,110
为什么旗帜上有张脸
Why is there a face on that flag?

54
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,330
他叫斐迪南·T·旗帜
It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,800
我觉得他能吸引少儿观众群
I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,320
真讨厌  不过没错  这主意妙
Confound it! You're right, it's brilliant.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,980
我们从头开始录吧
Let's take it from the top.

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,250
生活大爆炸第五季第十四集

59
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,980
晚饭真不错
That was a really nice dinner.

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,540
我很开心你又约我出去了
I'm glad you asked me out again.

61
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,550
我也是  我很想你
Me, too; I missed you.

62
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,990
你天天都能看到我
You see me all the time.

63
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,220
你确定你想的不是滚床单的部分吗
You sure you just don't miss the sex?

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,980
好吧  和你滚床单的感觉是很棒
Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.

65
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,530
你试过吗
Have you ever tried it?

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,570
试过  你说的没错
I have. You are not wrong.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,500
我只是觉得  如果我们要复合的话
I just think if we're gonna try dating again,

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,860
应该慢慢来
we should take things slow.

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,210
我可以慢慢来啊
Oh, I can take it slow.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,630
我有和你说过我高中时的第一任女友
Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school,

71
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,200
凯伦·波布瑞克吗
Karen Berberick?

72
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,690
至今她都不知道当时我们是在约会
To this day she doesn't know we were going out.

73
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,380
不过这么一来  分手的时候就容易多了
Made it easier on her when I broke things off.

74
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,590
好吧  也不要那么慢
Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

75
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,030
那这样吧
How about this,

76
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,500
你知道电脑软件通常是怎么开发的吗
are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?

77
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,180
为了好玩  就当我不知道好了
You know, just for fun, let's say I'm not.

78
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,130
在一款应用程序发布之前
Before an application is released,

79
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,690
都会先进行测试
they give it a trial run.

80
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,170
我们可以这么做
W-We could do that.

81
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,250
如果我们遇到分歧  不要生气
And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad,

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,210
就当是发现了个问题
just say, "Hey, we found a bug,"

83
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,350
把问题报告出来  然后修复
and we report it so it can be fixed.

84
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,070
是像公开测试那种吗
You mean like a beta test?

85
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,140
严格上来说  这是内部测试
Well, technically, this would be an alpha test.

86
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,480
公开测试是给没参与
A beta test requires people that weren't involved

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,460
程序开发的无关人士...
in the development of the appli...

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,400
我好歹知道"公开测试"  不该表扬一下吗
Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?

89
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,950
当然
No, you should.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,850
当然了  是我在卖弄学问
Absolutely. That was me being pedantic.

91
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,070
这是我们的第一个问题
That's our first bug.

92
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,500
你报告了
You reported it.

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,490
我修复了
I can fix that.

94
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,040
看见吗  这样不错
See? This is good.

95
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,480
好吧  那我们就试试
All right. Let's give it a shot.

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
很好  咱俩都列个单子记录
Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
到时候再交换
At some point, we'll exchange.

98
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,630
好
Okay.

99
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,100
-晚安  莱纳德  -晚安
- Good night, Leonard. - Night.

100
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,220
干得好  霍夫斯塔德
Attaboy, Hofstadter.

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,740
没什么比喻能比软件开发
Nothing gets the ladies hotter

102
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,160
更能让女人兴奋
than software development analogies.

103
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,320
我回来了
Hey, I'm back.

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,050
停
Cut.

105
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
第四十七遍
Take 47.

106
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,900
告诉你一件旗帜的趣事
Here's an interesting fact about flags.

107
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,380
我就当你自动开录了
I will take that action.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,490
列支敦斯登和海地的国旗
The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti

109
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,530
以前碰巧是一样的
were identical by coincidence,

110
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,920
直到两国在1936年奥运会对战时
a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed

111
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,660
才发现这个巧合
against each other at the 1936 Olympics.

112
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,800
不过幸好  当时西班牙内战拯救了
And thankfully,their embarrassment was overshadowed
1936年西班牙人民开始反法西斯斗争
其内战被称为"小二战"

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
让两国的尴尬
by the rise of Fascism.

114
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,210
看看你的新手机
Let's see the new phone.

115
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,250
我在上班路上买的
I stopped on the way to work.

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,260
你要不要跟我一起揭开贴膜
Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?

117
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,170
我何德何能呀
Really? Me?

118
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,350
这可是最棒那部分呀
That's, like, the best part.

119
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,730
从边上揭吧
Grab a corner.

120
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,790
喂  别这么猴急  粗鲁牛仔
Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy?

121
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,420
享受这一刻
Savor the moment.

122
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,720
太他妈爽了
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,590
说到牛仔
Speaking of cowboys,

124
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,260
知道哪个国家的国旗印着两只牛吗
do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag?

125
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,110
内陆小国家  安道尔共和国
The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra.

126
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,430
由谢尔顿·库珀出品的
Oh, the next classic episode

127
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,940
《旗帜的乐趣》  精彩下一集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags

128
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,870
题材如泉涌呀
is writing itself.

129
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,030
让我试试语音识别功能
Oh, let me try the voice recognition.

130
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,120
去  人家都让你揭膜了  别得寸进尺
Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don't get greedy.

131
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,860
你好
Hello?

132
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,630
你好
Hello.

133
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,130
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,550
我的名字叫Siri
My name? It's Siri.

135
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,660
瞧瞧
Look at that.

136
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,320
终于出现一个你敢跟她讲话的女人了
There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.

137
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,940
你现在是单身吗
Are you single?

138
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,660
如果你是问婚姻状况的话
I don't have a marital status,

139
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,300
我没有这个属性
if that's what you're asking.

140
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,440
也是  这个问题太私人了
Yeah, you're right, that's too personal.

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,220
我们才刚认识
We hardly know each other.

142
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,790
去喝杯咖啡怎么样
How about a cup of coffee?

143
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,140
我找到六个咖啡馆
I've found six coffee shops.

144
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,700
其中三个离你很近
Three of them are fairly close to you.

145
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,200
先生们回见啦
I will see you gentlemen later.

146
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,420
她铁定让他心碎
She is gonna break his heart.

147
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,350
对于利用时光机
For someone who has a machine

148
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,440
穿越时空的人
that can travel anywhere in time and space,

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,470
《神秘博士》  英国科幻电视剧
神秘博士对现代的伦敦还真是情有独钟
Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.

150
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,580
注意点  说这种无礼的话
Careful, it's that kind of sass

151
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,950
会让你被今年神秘会谈的拒之门外
that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con.

152
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,350
我们这次不算约会吧
Uh, we're not counting this as a date, are we?

153
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,860
我不确定
Um, I'm not sure,

154
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,670
不过我觉得正确答案应该是"不算"
but I think the right answer here is "no."

155
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,360
问题报告  当异性约我出来
Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him,

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,430
他是不是应该安排一些更有趣的事
maybe he plans something a little more interesting

157
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,930
而不是坐在家里看电视
than hanging out at home, watching TV.

158
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,290
《神秘博士》也没趣?
Even <i>Doctor Who?</i>

159
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
《神秘博士》很没趣
Even <i>Doctor Who.</i>

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,740
够了  神秘会谈没你份
All right, that's it. Who Con-- you're out.

161
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,600
好的  问题报告已收到
Okay, bug report taken.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,250
下次我会安排更好的夜晚活动
Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity.

163
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,560
谢谢  明天见
Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

164
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,800
等等  我差点忘了
Oh, wait, here, almost forgot.

165
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,390
-给  -这是什么
- Here. - What's this?

166
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,710
我记录你的问题报告
My bug report to you.

167
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,540
这表列得还挺长的嘛
Well, that's quite a list you got there.

168
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,130
有分颜色标记
It's color coded.

169
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,360
红色的代表"马上修复"
Uh, red means "fix right away."

170
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,060
黄色的代表"有时间再说"
Yellow is "eh, whenever you get a chance."

171
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,180
绿色的代表"我应该可以适应"
And green, is "I could probably learn to live with it."

172
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,620
最下面还有标注呢
There's a key down here at the bottom.

173
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,020
一目了然吧
It's neat, huh?

174
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,470
是
Yep.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,050
那晚安啦
So, have a good night.

176
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,120
好
Yep.

177
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,350
瞧瞧
Look at that.

178
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,910
将来我们可以告诉后人
Some day, we will tell future generations

179
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,880
约会变得不再困难
that dating used to be hard.

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
我不解的是你能列出什么问题
What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list.

181
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,540
"秀发太金黄"?
"Hair too golden"?

182
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,250
"笑声太动听"?
"Laugh too musical"?

183
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,660
"她的出现"
"World too much a better place

184
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,630
"让世界更美好"?
for her mere presence in it"?

185
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,860
"经常说话的时候满嘴食物"  这条怎么样
How about "constantly talks with food in her mouth"?

186
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,530
她内心充满爱  没人会在意她嘴里有什么
Her heart's full of love, no one cares what's in her mouth.

187
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,500
Siri
So, Siri,

188
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,650
怎么样  你最近好吗
what's happening? How are you?

189

你现在在干什么
What are you doing right now?

你还能在干什么
What am I doing?

192
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,230
我在跟你说话啊
I'm talking with you.

193
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,880
你的声音真好听

194
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,000
谢谢  有人欣赏很真好
Thank you, it's nice to be appreciated.

195
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,880
这是自然
I bet it is.

196
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,750
为什么没有女人喜欢我
Why don't women like me?

197
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,730
我查查看
Let me check on that.

198
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,620
网页搜索下"为什么没有女人喜欢我"怎么样
How about a Web search for "Why don't women like me?"

199
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,280
不用了  我早就搜过了
No need. I've already done that.

200
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,050
Siri  你有姓吗
Siri, do you have a last name?

201
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,990
我名叫Siri
My name is Siri.

202
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,170
只有名啊
Ah, one name.

203
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,470
像雪儿  麦当娜 阿黛尔
Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele.

204
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,380
她们的声音都让我荡漾
All the women who rock me.

205
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,880
我名叫拉杰什  但你可以叫我拉杰

207

我想要你叫我帅哥

From now on, I'll call you sexy. Okay?

209
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,990
好啊
Okay!

210
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,660
Siri  我想吃意大利冰激凌
Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

211
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,860
我找到了十家评论里有意大利冰激凌的餐厅

213

怎么了
I'm sorry?

217
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,520
你迈出了革命性的一步
You've taken a great evolutionary leap

218
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,750
你放弃了和人类的互动
by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself

219
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,390
却爱上了和冷冰冰的机器打情骂俏
to romantically bond with a soulless machine.

220

我没爱上它
I haven't bonded with it.

222
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,400
是的  那当然
Oh, no, of course.

223
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,450
我懂得
I understand.

224
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,010
你害怕这世界还不能接受你的禁忌之爱
You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love.

225
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,800
我会守口如瓶的
Your secret's safe with me.

226
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,940
这只是个手机

241

对不起  巴尼[里]
I'm sorry, Bawwy.

242
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,210
我不懂什么是"腿荐个番馆"
I don't understand "wecommend a westauwant."

243
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,080
"钉"我说
Wisten to me.

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,420
不是"番"馆  是"番"馆

245
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,910
我不明白什么是
I don't know what you mean

246
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,160
"不是番馆  是番馆"
by "not westauwant; westauwant."

247

249
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,860
嘿  不要跟她这么说
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

250
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,540
她是位女士
She's a lady.

251
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,010
"作"晚  这位"奴"士给我的老二
Well, that wady took high-wes pictures

257
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,190
你不能晚点看吗
Can you finish it later?

258
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,470
不行
No, I can't.

259
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,570
看书现在是我生活中重要的一部分  因为...
Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know,

260
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,410
我看得越多  我们的共同话题就越多
we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.

261
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,770
太好了  太好了
Great. Good. Great.

262

两星期腹肌速成
Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.

264
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,120
光书名就剧透了  不是吗
They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don't they?

265
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,670
好的
All right.

266
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,690
听着  要记住我们的约定
Look, just remember how this works.

267
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,640
不能因为这些事情生气
We don't get mad about these things.

268
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,440
说到这  我根据你的问题报告
Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed

269
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,580
修正了我今晚的约会安排

All right. Terrific.

273
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,890
那让我找双不那么高的鞋子
Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

274
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,830
这样你就不会觉得
We wouldn't want you to feel like you were

275
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,020
是在跟自己的妈妈散步
out for a walk with your mommy.

276
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,610
谢谢

277
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,090
这是我给你的报告  放这儿了
Here's my list for you-- right there.

278
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,040
好的  有来有往
All right, fair enough.

279
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,310
接吻的时候  我当然能安静点
I certainly can be quieter when we kiss.

280
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,630
我原以为这是热情的表示
I thought it was an expression of passion,

281
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,470
但是如果被形容为"很湿很奇怪"
but if it's coming across as "juicy and weird,"

282
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,090
我宁愿作罢
who wants that?

283
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,240
不好意思
Uh, uh... I'm sorry.

284
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,230
你能解释下  我的眉毛"很笨"是什么是意思
Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are "stupid"?

285
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,940
不用了  看见了
No, never mind. It's right here.

286
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,740
来得正好
Good timing.

287
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,970
饭菜都快准备好了
Dinner's almost ready.

288
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,930
太好了
Great.

289
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,120
闻起来很不错
Oh, smells amazing in here.

290
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,210
我们吃什么
Oh, what are we eating?

291
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,740
来点异域风情
Oh, an exotic little treat.

292
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,400
我正在跟Siri谈北京烤鸭
I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck,

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,760
她说她知道四家中国食品店
and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers,

294
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,470
其中两家离这很近
two of which were fairly close to me.

295
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,910
我被她自发性的语音功能传染了
Her spontaneity is contagious.

296
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,190
Siri是谁啊
Who's Siri?

297
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,960
他有新女友了吗
Is he dating somebody new?

298
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
是啊  他手机嘛
Yes. His phone.

299
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,520
这该算是可爱还是可怕啊
Is that cute or creepy?

300
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,660
我给你们倒点酒吧
Can I pour you some wine?

301
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,490
你们会喜欢的
I think you'll enjoy it.

302
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,100
一般来说  北京烤鸭是佐以
The traditional choice with Peking duck

303
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,360
长相思葡萄酒而食
is a sauvignon blanc,

304
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,290
另译白苏维翁  一种果香丰富的白葡萄酒

305
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,500
但Siri建议我采用非干型威士莲佐餐
but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

306
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,150
非干型:形容葡萄酒有一些甜味 但不是很甜
威士莲:最精致的白葡萄酒品种

307
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,130
我也不确定
I wasn't sure,

308
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,420
但我实在不想
but I didn't want to have an argument

309
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,700
在乔氏超市连锁店跟她吵起来
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

310
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,840
该让Siri穿什么衣服赴宴呢
Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner?

311
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,090
性感的豹纹壳  闪耀的钻石壳
Leopard, sparkles,

312
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,990
可可·香奈儿  20世纪法国设计师
或者用可可·香奈儿的话来说
or to paraphrase Coco Chanel,

313
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,860
黑色是永不出错的颜色
you can never go wrong with a little black case?

314
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,410
Siri  为我们奏一曲抒情爵士乐吧
Siri, play some smooth jazz.

315
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,980
播放抒情爵士乐
Playing smooth jazz.

316
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
凯丽·金  全球最著名的高音萨克斯风名家
天啊  是凯丽·金的曲子
Oh, my God, Kenny G?!

317
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,940
这个女人简直把我看透了
This woman can read me like a book.

318
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,030
我不敢相信居然在格兰岱尔凯丹广场  买到了我的灵魂伴侣
I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.

319
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,740
我觉得我待不下去了
I don't know if I want to stay.

320
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,390
这简直酷毙了
This is amazing.

321
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,920
你是怎么想到这主意的
How did you even get this idea

322
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,950
我打电话给你爸
I called your dad.

323
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,940
问他你小时候都爱玩些什么
I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid.

324
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,890
来这里比找头牛让你玩推到
This seemed easier than getting a cow out here

325
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,290
容易多了
so you could tip it.

326
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,410
你真是棒极了
Okay, you're kind of really great.

327
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,620
你是在夸一个按摩你脖子时
You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like

328
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,440
就像老鹰要把你叼回巢里的人吗
an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?

329
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,360
问题报告
Okay, bug report.

330
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,380
我刚夸奖了你
I just complimented you.

331
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,620
你应该欣然接受  然后闭嘴
You should take it and shut up.

332
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,910
好  我错了  对不起
Right. Sorry, sorry.

333
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,220
不要没完没了地向我道歉
And stop apologizing all the time.

334
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,350
好  对不起
Right. Sorry.

335
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,800
好啦  咱们开练吧
All right, let's shoot stuff.

336
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,170
需要我教你怎样射击吗
You want me to show you what to do?

337
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,910
我可是个玩《侠盗猎车手》的老手
I play a lot of <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

338
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,860
玩起手枪可是驾轻就熟
I think I know how to handle a gat.

339
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,090
你痞里痞气的时候还真可爱
Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.

340
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,070
现在我多了处枪伤
So, I've got a gunshot wound.

341
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,390
痞子感更十足了吧
That's pretty bad-ass.

342
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,160
才不是呢  是你的锐步鞋上多了处枪伤
No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound

343
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,560
你那粉嫩的脚趾头不过是擦伤
and an ouchie on your pinky toe.

344
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,790
拜托  医生给我贴了个创可贴
Hello? They gave me a Band-aid.

345
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,120
医院不能随便给病人开创可贴的
Hospitals do not issue Band-aids

346
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,570
除非是伤情严重  万不得已
unless it is medically necessary.

347
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,050
这可是法律规定
That is the law.

348
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,420
今晚酷毙了  谢谢你
Well, thank you for a really cool evening.

349
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,450
也谢谢你在急诊室帮我
Thank you for hiding my <i>Star Wars</i> socks

350
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,990
把《星球大战》的袜子藏起来
at the emergency room.

351
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,240
现在我们是不是评估下公测
Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test

352
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,870
看看我们的进展了
and see where we stand?

353
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,050
前途一片光明
Things are looking good.

354
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,300
那么  我们还要慢慢来吗
So, are we still taking things slow?

355
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,840
鉴于今天我受了枪伤
Because a gunshot wound today,

356
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,430
而上周
and last week,

357
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,070
我的大拇指被厨房的抽屉给夹伤
I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer.

358
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,120
我估计我命不久矣
We don't know how much time I have.

359
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,160
晚安
Good night, you.

360
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,030

Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area.

369
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,840
其中有4个离你家非常近
Four are fairly close to you.

370
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,700
你好  帅哥
Hello, sexy.

371
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,390
有什么需要我效劳
What can I help you with?

372

对不起  我不知道什么是...
I'm sorry. I don't understand...

374
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,530
不要啊
No!
