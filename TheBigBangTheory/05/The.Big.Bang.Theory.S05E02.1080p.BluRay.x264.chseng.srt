1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,470
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,000
普丽娅一会要跟我用Skype视频
Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,170
我们准备共进晚餐
and we are gonna have a dinner date.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,470
现在是孟买时间早上八点
It's 8 o'clock in the morning in Mumbai.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,620
她怎么就吃起晚饭来了
How can she have dinner?

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,680
好吧  随你怎么说
Fine, whatever.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,060
那普丽娅就吃早餐好了
Priya will be having breakfast.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,300
好吧  所以严格来讲你们俩不是共进晚餐
All right, so technically it's not a dinner date.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,820
也许你勉强可以把这称为共进早晚餐
I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,900
不过你要是真这么叫的话
But if you did, you'd open yourself

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,640
你肯定会被别人笑死  人家肯定会说
to peer-based mocking, such as,

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,190
莱纳德  你昨晚跟普丽娅的早晚餐吃的好吗
"Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,560
听起来不像是在笑话我呀
That doesn't sound like mocking.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,030
我还没说完呢
You didn't let me finish.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,080
早晚餐
Dinfast.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,150
那是大豆蜡的蜡烛吗
Are those soy-based candles?

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,700
不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,620
石蜡蜡烛可能含有致癌物
Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,290
当然啦  你要是想吃顿早晚餐
Unless lung cancer is the ambiance

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,460
还搭上肺癌的话  我也不拦你
you were going for at your dinfast.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,790
早晚餐
Dinfast.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,380
我不想无礼
Listen, I don't want to be rude,

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,270
可是普丽娅随时都会打来
but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so...

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,860
对哦  普丽娅
Oh, yes, Priya.

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,860
莱纳德  你知道我从来
Leonard, you know I make a point of

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,740
都不干涉你的私事
never interfering in your personal affairs.

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,820
没错  我也一直很欣赏你这点
Yes, I've always admired that about you.

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,250
那是当然
As well you should.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,540
但是我这次要破例了
But I'm going to make an exception here.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,210
又来了
Oh, good.

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,530
普丽娅回印度去发展自己的法律事业
Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career.

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,000
你与其花这些时间绝望地挣扎
Instead of desperately trying

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,370
费劲心思地保持这段跨洲恋情
to keep this intercontinental relationship alive,

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,420
你还不如找点别的兴趣爱好呢
you could use that time to take up a hobby.

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,770
兴趣爱好
A hobby?

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,110
没错
Yes.

37
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,360
我最近得知堪萨斯州一个家伙
I read recently about a fellow in Kansas

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,950
拿麻绳团了一个巨大的球
with an enormous ball of twine.

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,830
我认为你可以跟他一比高下
I bet you could give him a run for his money.

40
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,040
你知道吗  有些人可能会说
You know, some people might say that it's great

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,270
我们俩保持这种异地恋是精神可嘉的事
that we're trying to make things work long distance.

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,570
他们会说
They'd say things like,

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,580
爱情不会被你们俩之间的距离所打败
"Love is stronger than the miles between you".

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,330
等有一天我掌权了  我肯定会灭掉这帮人
When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,450
你也整天跟艾米视频呀
You video-chat with Amy all the time.

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,840
咱俩干的事有什么不同
How is this different?

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,340
你不喜欢艾米吗
Don't you like Amy?

48
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,120
我当然喜欢艾米啦
Of course I like Amy.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,420
可我不喜欢普丽娅呀
Well, there's the difference.

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,960
不好意思  普丽娅打来了
Excuse me, that's Priya.

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,150
莱纳德
Hi, Leonard.

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,150
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

53
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,350
我好想你
I miss you.

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,550
我也好想你
Oh, I miss you, too.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,890
我怀念以前爱情伴侣们
I miss the old days when your romantic partners

56
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,340
能退回录像店的日子
could be returned to the video store.

57
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,450
谢谢你让我待在这
Thanks for letting me stay here

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,490
这样我就不用看着莱纳德跟他女朋友视频了
while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

59
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,120
小意思
Oh, it's no problem.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
这种感觉还挺不错的呢
It's actually kind of nice.

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,490
你在看书  我也在看书
You reading, me reading.

62
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,160
咱俩就像一对老夫老妻似的
We're like an old married couple.

63
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,460
咱俩要真是老夫老妻的话
If we were an old married couple,

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,120
妻子这个时候就会端上冻柠茶和曲奇饼了
the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,050
我家没有冻柠茶和曲奇饼
I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.

66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,310
尽职的妻子就会去商店买
A good wife would go to the store.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,690
我要离婚
I want a divorce.

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,700
很好  你去找律师的路上
Good. On the way to see the lawyer,

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,190
别忘了买点冻柠茶和曲奇饼
pick up some tea and cookies.

70
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,270
我还真得说  我挺喜欢你这张新椅子的
I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.

71
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,630
舒服吧
It's great, isn't it?

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
没错
It is.

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,940
符合腰椎曲线
Aligns the lumbar,

74
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,360
支撑住了尾骨  还平衡了臀部
cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks.

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,780
这椅子还真对得起它的名字
This is a chair worthy of the name.

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,860
什么名字
What name?

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,180
椅子呀
Chair.

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,990
好吧  你喜欢就好
Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it.

79
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,900
我还是想不通
I mean, I still can't get over the fact

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,870
怎么有人就忍心把它给扔了呢
someone just threw it away.

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,330
你说什么
What?

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,780
就是说呀  这椅子就被丢在路上
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street.

83
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,290
我给了个流浪汉十块钱  让他帮我把这张椅子搬上来的
I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,640
哦天呐  哦天呐
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,630
你怎么啦
What is wrong?

86
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,120
我刚坐在垃圾上了
I've been sitting in garbage!

87
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,650
谢尔顿  淡定嘛
Sheldon, take it easy.

88
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,470
你去淡定吧  我得去趟浴室
You take it easy! I need to use your shower.

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,560
我当年结婚的时候还是太过乐观了
I went into this marriage with so much hope.

90
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,620
浴室地板上有张湿创口贴
There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor!

91
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,890
生活大爆炸第五季第二集

92
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,560
真有意思
This is fun.

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,760
我还从来没用过热成型液压机呢
I've never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,090
很赞吧
Pretty sweet, huh?

95
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,230
这个小玩意儿花了学校十七万五千刀
This little baby set the university back 175 grand.

96
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,280
三分钟到了
That's three minutes.

97
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,180
-让我们看看成果如何  -马上好
- Shall we see what we got?  -Hang on

98
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,220
哦也
Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,580
这真是个有型的三明治
This is one good-looking panini.

100
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,120
把金枪鱼三明治给我
Hand me the tuna melt.

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,030
-给  -多谢
- Yep.  - Thank you.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,960
你那跨国异地恋怎么样啦
How's it going with the long-distance love affair?

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
不容易啊  但我俩正在努力
Not easy, but we're making it work.

104
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,600
你这句"正在努力"包不包括玩些线上耍流氓啊
When you say "Making it work," does that include doing the cyber nasty?

105
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
什么
What?

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,300
你懂的  就是虚拟的很黄很暴力的那种啊
You know, the virtual pickle tickle.

107
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,570
数字化的嘿嘿咻咻
The digital... bow-chicka-bow-bow.

108
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,320
拜托  伙计  你在说我妹啊
Come on, dude. This is my sister you're talking about.

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,620
喂  对你来说
Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her

110
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,940
莱纳德在摄像头里对着她抖那货
through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with

111
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,990
总要好过他当着她的面拿那货戳她吧
than him actually touching her with it.

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
我没那么猥琐
There's no junk jiggling.

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,110
我们就是聊天而已
We just talk.

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,970
你疯了吧
Are you sane?

115
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,250
有了高速互联网  你的指尖下
With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips

116
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,910
注: 小手帕是撸sir之友
就是继小手帕之后性爱领域的
the greatest advancement in the field of sex

117
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,590
最伟大的进步啊
since the invention of the washcloth.

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,280
好吧  你要是不这么做
Well, if you don't,

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,780
你就是把普丽娅拱手让给某个
you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban

121
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,700
从小看《印度爱经》插图版长大的头巾男了
who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.

122
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,070
你怎么能这么种族歧视呢
How can you be so racist?

123
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,290
拜托  我哪句说错了
Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

124
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,290
莱纳德  很好
Oh, Leonard, good.

125
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,430
找到你了
There you are.

126
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,430
我需要你来检查我头上有没有虱子
I need you to check my head for chair lice.

127
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,250
我昨晚查过了  我不能再犯傻了
I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.

128
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,970
没检查别的地儿  对吧
Just his head, right?

129
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,440
我不想聊这事儿
I don't want to talk about it.

130
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,140
佩妮椅子上的虫子没跑到你身上
You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.

131
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,560
不对  有虫子
Yes, I did.

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,900
现在它们在我的发根毛囊里欢呼雀跃
And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles

133
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,430
就像在红木国家森林公园里跳舞
like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,770
谢尔顿  你老是这样
Sheldon, you do this all the time.

135
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,910
你总是纠结于某个傻乎乎的想法
You fixate on some crazy idea

136
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,710
然后无限制地放大
and then blow it way out of proportion.

137
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,910
请举一个例子
Name one time I've ever done that.

138
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,460
比如上次你把GPS追踪器放进垃圾桶里
How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage

139
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,380
就因为你坚信朝鲜间谍
because you were convinced North Korean spies

140
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,350
在偷你的草稿纸
were stealing your doodles?

141
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,660
还有你坚信是人肉做的鸡块
The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets.

142
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,510
还有那朵奇形怪状的在城里老跟踪你的云
The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town.

143
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,930
还有那次你错穿了我的T恤
The time you put on my shirt by mistake

144
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,730
还以为自己又开始长个儿了
and were convinced you'd started growing again.

145
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,730
我说的是  "举一个例子"
I said, "Name one."

146
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,490
你的听力真得练练了
You really need to work on your listening skills.

147
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,150
佩妮

149
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,550
乃好[你好]
Yello.

150
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,720
你得把那个椅子从楼里搬出去
You need to remove that chair from the building.

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,580
它是个卫生隐患
It's a health hazard.

152
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,420
好吧  淡定吧  我把家具套给拆下来
Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers,

153
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,970
送去干洗了  坐垫也熏蒸消毒了
had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.

154
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,270
真的吗
Really?

155
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,740
必须的  它现在比我的沙发还干净
Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch.

156
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,400
我还在里面找到了半个鸡蛋灌饼呢
Found half a Hot Pocket in there.

157
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,250
看起来还不错
It certainly looks okay.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,700
有一股强烈的有毒化学药剂味
Has a strong toxic chemical smell.

159
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,370
真让人安心啊
That's reassuring.

160
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,290
坐上去试试呗  谢尔顿
Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?

161
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,120
好吧
All right.

162
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,990
这椅子挺舒服
It is a comfortable chair.

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,150
你为啥不承认你之前反应过激了呢
Why don't you just admit you overreacted?

164
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,060
不必了  多谢
No, thank you.

165
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,350
简直像跟个吉娃娃一起住一样
It's like living with a Chihuahua.

166
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,990
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮

167

有事吗  小毛孩
What's up, buttercup?

168
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,930
你必须把那椅子扔了
You have to get rid of the chair.

169
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,550
不

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,340
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny. Penny. Penny.

171
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,460
想叽歪啥呀  小蜂鸟
What's the word, hummingbird?

172
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,130
为你安全考量  请到我们那等着
For your safety, please wait in my apartment

173
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,210
让我报警请他们搬走这死亡之椅
as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.

174
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,370
不要
No.

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,600
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny! Penny! Penny!

176
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,200
有何指示  小物理学家
What's the gist, physicist?

177
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,150
作为本街道疾控中心
Under my authority as a self-appointed member

178
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,510
自封的一员  我宣布

179
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,710
此房屋应报废

180
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,830
作为有着敏锐时尚感的达人

181
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,800
我必须说  那椅子跟你家一点都不配
I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room.

182

277
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,240
我也得被你拉下水吧

你是说类似盐湖城的地方吗
You mean like Salt Lake City?

281
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,260
算了  我会跟佩妮说的

谢谢

283
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,880
那现在听我演奏竖琴好吗

284
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,470
不要  我不喜欢竖琴的声音
No. I dislike the sound of the harp.

285
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,690
竖琴在经典电视情景喜剧中的过度使用
Its overuse in classic television sitcoms

286
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,790
每每让我觉得

我过去的噩梦又再度上演了

对不起  妈咪  别生我的气

289
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,330
别弹了
Don't do that!

290
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,530
我不懂的  霍华德
I don't know about this, Howard.

291
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,950
什么  你对远程做爱有障碍吗
What? You're having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking.

292
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,490
这就是你的法宝
This is your answer.

293
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,870
上面有两个端口能刺激嘴部
There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth.

294
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,590
你这配一个  在印度的普莉娅配一个
You have one, Priya has one in India.

295
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,860
你只要移动你的嘴唇和舌头
When you move your lips and tongue on yours,

296
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,960
就能传输信号  感觉像是你真的在吻她
it transmits exactly what you're doing to hers.

297
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,050
看见没  网络亲吻
See? Internet kissing.

298
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,110
来试试
Give it a try.

299
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,170
还是算了
I don't think so.

300
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,120
我来试试
I'll try it.

301
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,950
像这样吗
Like this?

302
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,040
差不多  把你的舌头伸进去
Almost. Really get your tongue in there.

303
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,740
激活感应器

304
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,800
像这样吗
Like this?

305
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,710
差不多了  要法式舌吻
Close. Really French it.

306
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,770
好点了吗
Better?

307
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,180
对  就这样  太正点了
Yeah, you got it, you got it.

308
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,600
我震精了  这感觉太逼真了
I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

309
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,150
擦  你居然咬我舌头
Whoa! You just bit my tongue!

310
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,320
轻咬而已  我只想多点情趣
I-I nibbled. I was being playful.

311
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,210
你干嘛要把一切都搞得这么猥琐
Why do you have to make everything weird?

312
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,160
抱歉
Sorry.

313
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,420
好点了吗
Better?

314
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,970

315
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,760
很不错哈
Pretty cool, huh?

316
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,290
商店里买的话没准要两百块
Probably would cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

317
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,260
是很划算
I do appreciate a bargain.

318
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,900
我去世的奶奶以前有一套这种家具
This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.

319
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,850
不是吧
You're kidding.

320
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,070
除了内衣内裤什么都分享了
Everything except bra and panties.

321

对这沙发椅我只有一个问题
I just have one question about the chair.

324
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,200
什么
And what's that?

325
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,450
你就不担心这个不卫生吗
Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?

326
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,260
不  完全没有...
No, it's completely fine...

327
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,010
我懂了
Hmm. I get it.

328
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,060
是谢尔顿
Sheldon sent you.

329
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,280
是他让你来找我
He put you up to this.

330
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,560
-不  他没有  -真的吗
- No, he didn't. - Really?

331
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,530
是的  他有  就是他
Yes, he did. He absolutely did.

332
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,080
天啊  艾米  你太不够朋友了
My God, Amy, that's really crappy of you.

333
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,430
真的吗
It is?

334
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,040
当然  你让谢尔顿利用你来操控我
Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me?

335
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,440
我还以为我们是朋友
I thought you were my friend.

336
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,120
不  我们是朋友  请别生我气
No, I am your friend. Please don't be mad at me.

337
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,120
我简直难以置信
I can't even believe this.

338
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,780
你最好还是走吧
You know, maybe you should just go.

339
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,260
不  对不起  真的很对不起
No! No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

340
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,660
我把刚才的话都收回
I take it all back!

341
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,210
看  我坐在你的沙发椅上
Look! I'm, uh, I'm sitting in your chair.

342
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,010
完全没问题
There's nothing wrong with it.

343
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,710
这椅子棒极了
It's a great chair.

344
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,480
求你别把我踢出你的生活
Please let me continue to be part of your world.

345
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,920
怎么了
What's wrong?

346
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,240
椅子里有什么东西在咬我的臀部
Something in the chair's biting my tushy.

347
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,920
但这无所谓
It's not important. Ow!

348
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,270
快站起来
Wait. Get up, get up!

349
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,830
发誓你不会把这事告诉谢尔顿
Swear you won't tell Sheldon what happened!

350
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,110
我发誓
I swear!

351
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,950
我能告诉我医生吗  我觉得我得去打针
Can I tell my doctor? I'm probably gonna need shots!

352
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,870
当然可以
Yeah, sure!

353
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,170
宝贝儿  我觉得我已经懂了
Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.

354
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,320
莱纳德  先听我说
Oh, Leonard, listen...

355
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,820
不  你给我听好
No, you listen!

356
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,520
你是我的妞
You're my woman,

357
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,150
我要给你前所未有的快感
and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.

358
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,640
莱纳德
Leonard...

359
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,970
就是这样  用力叫出我的名字
That's right, say my name...

360
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,190
求我  求我再快点
and beg me for more, 'cause...

361
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,180
我会努力让你达到巅峰
I'm gonna give it to you.

362
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,530
我父母在旁边
My parents are here.

363
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,030
你好  莱纳德
Hello, Leonard...

364
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,740
我也能咬牙切齿用力喊你的名字吗
if I may also say your name.

365
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,710
看呀  从天而降的沙发椅
Check it out. Free chair.

366
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,160
可不是
Yeah.

367
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,430
要是谢尔顿和莱纳德的公寓里有个沙发椅
Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment,

368
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,570
我就不用老是坐在地板上了
I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor all the time.

369
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,640
来吗
On three?

370
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,340
-一二三  -抬
- Three! - Three!

371
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,740
哪个二货舍得扔掉这么好的沙发椅哟
What kind of idiot throws away
