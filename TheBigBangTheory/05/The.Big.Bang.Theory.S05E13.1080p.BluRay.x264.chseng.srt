1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,140
晚饭想不想换个花样
You feel like trying something new for dinner?

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,690
要不试试印度菜或者德墨菜
Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
德墨菜  德州式墨西哥菜
美国的德克萨斯州和墨西哥接壤

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,750
你有没有好奇过  如果人类是从蜥蜴
You ever wonder how humans would be different

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,860
而不是哺乳动物进化而来  会有啥区别
if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,130
好吧  你说吧
Okay, let's talk about that.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,160
你也知道  蜥蜴这种冷血动物
As you know, lizards-- cold-blooded animals--

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,400
缺乏感知温度的能力
lack the ability to sense temperature.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
但它们确实在低温环境下行动更迟缓
But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,970
所以呢  蜥蜴天气预报员会这么说话
So, lizard weathermen would say things like,

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,720
"带上件毛衣  外面好慢[冷]"
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,140
我爱死自己的犀利头脑了
I love my mind.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,780
我们也是
We all do.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,220
快说  晚饭吃啥
Now, how about dinner?

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,430
大多数蜥蜴吃动物性食物  主要是各种昆虫
体型较大的蜥蜴会以其他蜥蜴为食物
我猜我们会享受吃昆虫和小蜥蜴的盛宴
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,150
我们也可以扯掉对方的尾巴然后烤着吃
We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them;

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,780
反正还能再长回来
they'll just grow back.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,700
史波克先生  《星际迷航》中的大副先生
我的真人大小的卡纸板史波克先生到了
My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here!

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,670
我知道他不喜欢常人情感的瞬间流露
I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion,

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,490
可是  好棒哦  好棒哦  好棒哦
but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie, oh, goodie.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,960
史波克中校请求拆封
Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,350
失陪一下
Excuse me.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,160
允许拆封  中校
Permission granted, Commander.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,920
这就是为什么越聪明的猴子
Which is why the more intelligent the monkey,

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,390
就越喜欢扔大便
the more feces they fling.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,150
打断一下  艾米
Excuse me, Amy.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,030
佩妮  你今天的晚饭有安排吗
Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,230
怎么了  你们要去什么好地方吗
Why, you guys going somewhere?

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,560
不是  就咱俩单独吃
No, I mean just you and me.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,810
像约会那样吗
You mean, like a date?

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,420
不是约会的那种约会
Not like a date, a date.

31
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,090
呃  好吧
Um... o-okay.

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,180
行啊
Sure.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,600
天啊
Oh, no!

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,880
这不是我要的史波克
They sent the wrong Spock!

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,780
电视剧版《星际迷航》史波克的扮演者
生生不息  早日去死  扎克瑞·昆图
Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,660
生活大爆炸第五季第十三集

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,720
太好了
This is so exciting.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,470
要是莱纳德和佩妮复合了
If Leonard and Penny get back together,

39
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,700
我和霍华德就可以跟他们一起四人约会了
Howard and I can go on double dates with them.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,990
你怎么从来不邀请谢尔顿和我参加四人约会呢
How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,100
你衣服试得怎么样了  佩妮
How's it going in there, Penny?!

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,730
稍等片刻
Just a sec.

43
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,350
是不是太隆重了
Too much?

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,210
-确实  -才没有
- Yes. - No.

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,080
好吧  再等一下
Okay, just hang on.

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,490
你受不了她那股天生的骚劲  对吧
You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,440
你和莱纳德是什么时候分手的
When did you and Leonard break up?

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,730
差不多两年前吧
Uh, about two years ago.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,850
你觉得他约你吃饭的原因是什么
Why do you think he asked you out again?

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,530
不知道
I don't know.

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,700
也许是他命不久矣
Maybe he's dying.

52
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,300
那该有多浪漫啊
That would be so romantic.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,190
他命长着呢
He's not dying.

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,450
真可惜
Too bad.

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,500
如果是的话  她就可以把莱纳德推到在床
If he were, she could just throw him in bed

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,790
骑在他身上尽性  直到他心跳停止
and ride him right up until he flatlines.

57
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,730
这件怎么样
How about this?

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,470
-还行  -拜托
- Maybe. - Come on.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,560
好吧  这件不行
Yeah, okay, no.

60
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,380
你觉得你今晚会和他上床吗
Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,440
绝对不会
Absolutely not.

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
我们就是吃个饭
Look, we're just gonna have dinner

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,700
然后再看情况吧
and, you know, see how it goes.

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,370
如果他病入膏肓了  你会和他上床吗
If he were dying, would you sleep with him?

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,390
什么
What?!

66
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,970
假设他身患绝症
Assuming he were dying of something

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,090
而这种病不会通过性行为传播
that couldn't be sexually transmitted.

68
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,380
比如脑袋上的箭伤
You know, like a spear wound to the head.

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,020
够了  他的命长着呢
Okay, he is not dying.

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,100
你怎么知道  你是医生吗
How do you know? Are you a doctor?

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,870
不过你可以这么幻想嘛
You can make-believe, though.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,920
有时候霍华德和我会假装他出现了心律失常
Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,030
而我是一个性感的心脏病医生
and I'm a sexy cardiologist.

74
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,430
最好玩的部分是  我的护理服务可是不收费的哟
And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network.

75
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,510
算了  我不打算搞得好得多大件事
Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

76
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,910
就是吃个晚饭嘛
It's just dinner.

77
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,270
跟死人一起吃
With a dead man.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,570
艾米  别说了
Amy, stop it.

79
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,360
天啊  我好紧张
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
放松啦
Relax.

81
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
你知道莱纳德一直都很喜欢你
You know Leonard's always been crazy about you.

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,340
不会有事的
It's gonna be great.

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,790
我知道  可是我们好不容易才到了
I know, but we've finally gotten to a place

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,620
见面聊天都不尴尬的地步
where we can hang out without it being weird.

85
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,680
万一出了什么岔子呢  然后怎么办
And what if something goes wrong? Then what?

86
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,210
我猜只有谢尔顿和我
Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me

87
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,550
去陪霍华德和伯纳黛特一起四人约会了
going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.

88
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,820
是啊  我们好期待
Sure, we'd love that.

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,680
快换衣服  我俩可就指望你俩今晚的表现了
Change your clothes; we got a lot riding on this.

90
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,950
我想修条路
I want to build a road,

91
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,450
wood亦指勃起的阴茎
但我需要硬木
but I need wood.

92
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,840
你俩谁有硬木吗
Do either of you fellows have wood?

93
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,970
我不知道你们在笑什么
I don't understand the laughter.

94
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,650
《卡坦岛》的目标
The object of Settlers of Catan

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,610
就是修建道路和房屋
is to build roads and settlements.

96
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,130
所以需要硬木
To do so requires wood.

97
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,530
sheep有时用来指代发生性关系的女人
我现在有绵羊  缺硬木
Now, I have sheep; I need wood.

98
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,820
谁能拿硬木换我的绵羊
Who has wood for my sheep?

99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
我这身看着怎么样
Okay, how do I look?

100
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,990
我更想知道  你为什么要这么做
More to the point, why are you doing this?

101
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,830
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,370
你忘了佩妮当初怎么对你的吗
Did you forget what Penny did to you?

103
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,530
你花了两年的时间  还玷污了我妹妹
It took you two years and defiling my sister

104
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,540
才把你的愁云惨淡换成嬉皮笑脸
to turn that frown upside down.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,710
我没有玷污你妹妹  我们只是交往过
I didn't defile your sister,we had a relationship.

106
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,980
Brown Sugar 多数形容漂亮性感的黑人女性
我以前听你叫她"靓妹黑妞"呢
I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

107
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,190
在我看来  这就是玷污
In my book, that's defilement.

108
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
想听听我的意见吗
You want to know my opinion?

109
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,420
天啊  想听得不得了
Oh, boy, do I!

110
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,320
是故意说反话吗
Sarcasm?

111
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,010
不是
No.

112
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,810
那好吧
All right, then.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,330
你之所以对佩妮这种
The reason you're fixated on

114
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,640
秀外痴中的姑娘念念不忘
a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that

115
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,510
是因为她跟你的第一位爱慕对象截然相反
she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment:

116
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,760
也就是你害怕的天才母亲
your brilliant yet intimidating mother.

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,810
你怎么会有这种想法
Where on earth did you get that from?

118
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,390
她的书《越缺爱的小孩越贪心》里写的
It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

119
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,210
那也不代表就是真的
That doesn't make it true.

120
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,620
莱纳德  那本书可是非虚构类的
It's called nonfiction for a reason, Leonard.

121
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,990
回见
See you later.

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,380
如果有人把她那本书拍成电影
If they ever make a movie version of that book,

123
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,090
你们知道该由谁来扮演莱纳德的妈妈吗
you know who should play Leonard's mother?

124
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,660
桑德拉·布洛克  好莱坞著名女影星  演过不少爱情片
桑德拉·布洛克
Sandra Bullock.

125
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,010
为什么
Why?

126
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,250
因为她每部作品都诠释得很好
Because she's great in everything.

127
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,690
我们玩到哪儿了
Now, where were we?

128
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,300
对了  你们谁有硬木吗
Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood?

129
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
拜托
Oh, come on!

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,850
人家只是想要硬木而已
I just want wood.

131
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,050
有必要要搞得这么难[硬]啊
Why are you making it so hard?

132
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,580
有什么词可以形容
So, do they have a name for a first date

133
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,430
跟以前相好过的人第一次约会吗
with someone you used to go out with?

134
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,100
这个问题问得好
Oh, that's a good question.

135
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,020
"尴尬"怎么样
How about "awkward"?

136
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,190
-这词挺恰当的  -对吧
- Yeah, that sounds right. - Yeah?

137
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,540
要不我们假装这真的是第一次约会
Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date?

138
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,590
-看看结果怎么样  -好啊
- See how that goes. - Okay.

139
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,850
胖妮  跟我说说你吧
So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,260
我叫佩妮
It's Penny.

141
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,550
对不起  真尴尬
Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.

142
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,770
没事  我想想
Okay, uh, let's see.

143
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,050
我来自内布拉斯加  我还很小的时候
I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl,

144
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,040
就梦想着能搬到洛杉矶  成为一名电影明星
I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star.

145
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,980
不过上了四年的表演课
Anyway, after four years of acting lessons

146
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,180
当了四年服务员之后
and waiting tables,

147
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,040
我出演了一个痔疮广告
I've done a hemorrhoid commercial

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,020
和一个保龄球球道上面扮演过安妮·弗兰克
and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.

149
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,800
所以梦想真的能实现的
So, you know, dreams do come true.

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,810
该你了
Your turn.

151
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,220
我想想
Uh, let's see.

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,570
我是加州理工学院的实验物理学家
Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech,

153
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,740
大部分研究都跟高功率激光有关
most of my research is with high-powered lasers,

154
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,510
我最近刚拿到一大笔政府资助金
and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant

155
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,240
看看能不能用于研究
to see if they can be used to knock out

156
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
击落来袭的弹道导弹
incoming ballistic missiles.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,070
哇  那能实现吗
Wow. Can they?

158
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,640
废话  当然不行
Oh, God, no.

159
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,070
不过看在这么多钱的份上
The money's pretty good.

160
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,250
我还用那设备来发射自己的蝙蝠信号[蝙蝠侠中的求救信号]
And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.

161
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,030
蝙蝠信号
Bat-signal?

162
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,750
怎么  你是所谓的宅男吗
What are you, some kind of nerd?

163
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,670
不是所谓的宅男  而是宅男之王
Not some kind of nerd, I'm the king of the nerds.

164
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,750
宅男之王是什么意思
What does that mean?

165
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,660
意思是谁要是惹恼我了
Uh, it means if anyone displeases me,

166
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,080
我就不帮他们装打印机
I don't help them set up their printer.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
-你真幽默  -那就好
- You are so funny. - Good.

168
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,650
那我脱衣服的时候  你就想着这个优点好了
Remember that when I take my shirt off.

169
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,540
莱纳德  这样真好
Leonard, this is nice.

170
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,860
我很高兴我们能约会
I'm so glad we did this.

171
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,960
我也是
Me, too.

172
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,870
那你意下如何
So what do you think?

173
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,500
我们能复合吗
Are we gonna get back together?

174
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,170
不用这么快吧
Whoa. Not so fast.

175
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,020
对不起  我说错什么了吗
I'm sorry, what did I say?

176
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,770
莱纳德  你知道我对你的感觉永远不会变
Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.

177
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,710
-老天  -怎么了
- Oh, God. - What?

178
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,590
你说了"永远"
You said "always."

179
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,300
你对我的感觉永远不会变
You'll always have feelings for me.

180
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,920
有问题吗
So?

181
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,700
那听起来更像是在说
So, that sounds more like something you'd say

182
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,910
你不想和某人谈恋爱
if you <i>didn't</i> want a relationship with someone.

183
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,910
"我们不会有结果的"
"This isn't working out,"

184
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,810
"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
"but I'll always have feelings for you."

185
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,790
"对不起  我跟你的好朋友睡了"
"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,"

186
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,680
"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
"but I'll always have feelings for you."

187
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,640
"是这样的  丽莎"
"Here's the thing, Lisa,

188
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,790
"我现在喜欢男的了  但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you."

189
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,470
那你会怎么说
How would you say it?

190
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,160
我对你的感觉不会变
I have feelings for you.

191
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,610
-这不是一样嘛  -不一样
- It's the same thing. - No, it's not.

192
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,830
加上"永远"只会适得其反
"Always" made it worse.

193
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,280
-你想太多了  -我没有
- You're overthinking this. - No, I'm not.

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,000
你有  你永远都是这样
Yes, you are. You always overthink things.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,950
你看吧  一加"永远"就变味了
Th-There you go. "Always" made it worse.

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,950
瞧  我们一谈起来  就开始吵架
See, this is where everything goes wrong: when we talk.

197
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,760
谈恋爱当然要用"谈"的啦
Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.

198
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,470
我以前还跟一个叫TJ的家伙在一起八个月
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months,

199
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,240
我们从来没谈过话
we never talked.

200
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,640
直到现在  我都不知道TJ代表啥
To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.

201
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,760
等等  你们要是不谈的话
Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what--

202
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,700
算了  这问题真二
Never mind, stupid question.

203
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,030
我现在有硬木了
And now that I have some wood,

204
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,330
我的殖民地要开始"崛起"了
I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.

205
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,270
他肯定是故意这么说的
He's got to be doing this on purpose.

206
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,930
才八点半呢
Ooh, 8:30.

207
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,230
你跟佩妮是出去打酱油的吗
You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?

208
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,010
某人都三十岁了  还跟妈妈同住一屋
You are 30 years old and you live with your mother.

209
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,120
看来约会不太顺利
I guess it didn't go well.

210
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
我们可不知道
We don't know that.

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,910
不能确定
Not to a certainty.

212
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,380
我们只知道莱纳德到家了
All we know is that Leonard is home.

213
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,510
现在呢
How about now?

214
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,260
证据还是不够
Again, not enough evidence.

215
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,640
我们只知道他被谋杀了
For all we know, he's being murdered.

216
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,900
现在  继续游戏
Now, back to our game.

217
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,970
你不是在"崛起"中吗
You were in the middle of an erection.

218
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,400
对哦  那"玩意儿"就在我手中
Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.

219
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,770
她现在是想怎样
What does she want from me now?

220
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,530
怎么了
What's up?

221
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,140
别想太多
Do not overthink this.

222
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,690
-我不懂  -一切尽在不言中
- I don't understand. - Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

223
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,220
好吧  但是之前不是...
Okay, but earlier it seemed like...

224
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,980
别说话
No talking.

225
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,060
做的时候也不说话吗  因为有时我会想提问耶
Even during? 'Cause sometimes I have questions.

226
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,100
挺不错
Well, that was fun.

227
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,260
是啊  除掉我脚抽筋的部分
Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.

228
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,880
但你还是挺住了
You hung in there, though.

229
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,140
牺牲小我  成全大我
There was a lot at stake.

230
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,240
你现在想做什么
So what do you want to do now?

231
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,630
我想去拿我的哮喘吸入器
Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler,

232
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,260
但这样就太毁气氛了
but it might ruin the moment.

233
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,890
我还是不明白
Just, just help me out here.

234
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,160
为什么糟糕的约会能以滚床单收场
How does a miserable date end in sex?

235
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,550
我也不知道  这太复杂了
I don't know, it's complicated.

236
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,930
我很聪明的
Well, I'm a pretty smart guy,

237
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,090
而且现在血液主要在往大脑流动了
and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply,

238
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,360
试试也无妨嘛
so give it a go.

239
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,100
好吧  只是...
Okay, it's just,

240
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,710
在餐厅里你说想
at the restaurant when you said

241
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,010
想跟我复合
you wanted us to be together again,

242
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,490
感觉太真实太突然了  我吓到了
it got very real very fast and I panicked.

243
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,960
为什么
Why?

244
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,950
你在怕什么
What are you afraid of?

245
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,890
要是我们真的和好了
Well, what if we do go out

246
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,310
但我又做了什么蠢事  又把你甩了怎么办
and I do something stupid and dump you again?

247
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,970
怎么就不是我甩你呢
What if I dump you?

248
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,950
得了  别闹
Come on, be serious.

249
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,340
那不然我们都不把这当成是谈恋爱
Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship?

250
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,640
就好比是一款新的软件
It could be more like a new version of software.

251
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,600
佩妮和莱纳德2.0升级版
Penny and Leonard 2.0.

252
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,590
我们可以先内测捉虫
We can test it internally, shake out the bugs,

253
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,900
等我们都觉得稳定了
and if we both feel it's solid,

254
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,060
到时再公之于众
then we'll roll it out to the public.

255
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,730
那我们先不告诉别人我们复合了
So we don't tell people we're back together?

256
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,490
是的
Exactly.

257
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,720
我们假装约会进展不顺利
We pretend like our date went badly.

258
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,560
这已经不用假装了
Well, we don't really have to pretend.

259
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,230
我们让他们以为我们决定只做朋友
And we let them think that we decided to just be friends

260
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,600
那样的话就没问题了
and that everything's cool.

261
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,130
好啊
Okay, great.

262
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
我刚想起来
Hey, I just remembered.

263
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,280
我还留着你的吸入器
I still got one of your inhalers.

264
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,450
不敢相信你还留着
I can't believe you kept this.

265
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,140
我本来想扔掉  但还是舍不得
Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.

266
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,680
你太贴心了
That is so sweet.

267
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,990
大概再过二十五到三十分钟  你就能知道
In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you

268
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,750
这对我的意义有多"重大"了
how much this means to me.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,730
莱纳德
Leonard?

270
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,420
好啊
Yeah, hi, hi.

271
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,400
你好吗
How's it going?

272
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,490
没什么不好
Uh, can't complain.

273
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,890
不过还是谢谢
Thanks for asking.

274
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,890
你凌晨三点在外面做什么
Well, what were you doing out at 3:00 in the morning?

275
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,490
那你又在做什么
Well, uh, uh... what are you doing up?

276
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,230
我上厕所啊
I was using the bathroom.

277
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,360
我也是
Yeah, well, so was I.

278
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,570
真的吗
Really?

279
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,180
我怎么在里面没看到你
I didn't see you in there.

280
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,710
显然我看到你在用了
Obviously... when I saw that you were in ours,

281
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,590
所以我就出去用其它的了
I went and used another one.

282
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,740
上哪去用了
Where?

283
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,080
马路对面的加油站
The, the gas station across the street.

284
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,910
穿着睡衣去
In your pajamas?

285
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,980
是啊
Yes.

286
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,430
还没穿鞋去
Without shoes?

287
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,980
是啊
Yes.

288
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,740
大冬天三更半夜去
On a cold winter's night?

289
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,670
是啊
Yes.

290
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,740
不太可能啊
Seems unlikely.

291
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,000
你带你的哮喘吸入器了吗
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,580
是的  我当然带了
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.

293
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,780
那貌似就可信了
Well, then, I guess it's plausible.

294
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,690
-等等  先生  -干嘛
- D-- hang on a second, mister. - What?

295
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,550
你用过加油站的厕所后
After you used the facilities at the gas station,

296
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,090
-买东西了吗  -什么
- did you make a purchase? - What?

297
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,560
这是国际惯例  你用了零售店的厕所
It's customary, when using the restroom

298
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,040
就要随便买点东西
at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase.

299
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,940
你买了吗
Did you?

300
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,760
没有
No.

301
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
给你两块钱
Here's two dollars.

302
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,060
去买点牛肉干
Go buy some beef jerky.

303
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,300
我不想吃牛肉干
I don't want beef jerky.

304
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,470
这不是你想不想的问题
It's not about you.

305
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,140
这关系到可怜的巴基斯坦移民
It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan

306
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,780
在科罗拉多大道的
trying to make his way in America

307
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,310
雪佛龙公司上夜班
by working the graveyard shift

308
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,300
就为了在美国混口饭吃
at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

309
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,960
好吧
Fine.

310
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,870
还真是越缺爱的小孩越贪心啊
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.

311
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,000
莱纳德马上就来了
Leonard will be here in a moment.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,450
他要重找一个停车位
He's looking for a different parking space.

313
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,400
为什么
Why?

314
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,950
我们旁边停着一辆车
We were next to a car

315
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,700
上面贴着一张贴纸  写着"聊聊我的孙子们"
with an "Ask me about my grandchildren." bumper sticker,

316
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,070
我担心如果走的时候遇到那辆车的车主
and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out,

317
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,170
我就有义务就跟他聊
I'd be obligated to do so.

318
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,350
他跟佩妮的约会居然失败了  我好失望
I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny.

319
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,880
我也是
Me, too.

320
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,120
为了不伤害到他们
Out of deference to them,

321
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,820
咱们就别炫耀自家的完美恋情了
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

322
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,100
你还真是体贴善良啊
You have a keen insight into the human heart,

323
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,610
艾米·费拉·福勒
Amy Farrah Fowler.

324
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,750
2000年美国总统选举中民主党的正副总统候选人
现在旁边那辆斯巴鲁上贴着一张写着"戈尔/利伯曼"的贴纸
We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.

325
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,500
我觉得他们不会想聊那个  所以我们安全了
Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.

326
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,820
你跟佩妮的约会搞砸了
I'm surprised to see you here

327
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,930
你居然还会来这吃饭
after it went so badly with Penny.

328
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,640
我们都是大人了
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.

329
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,200
买卖不成仁义在嘛
We can still be friends.

330
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,390
天啊  要是我跟霍华德分手了
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie

331
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
估计就做不成朋友了
if we broke up.

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,650
为什么
Why not?

333
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,980
我是个报复心很重的人
I'm a very vengeful person.

334
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,960
真的吗
Really?

335
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,530
而且我还能弄到改造成生化武器的天花
With access to weaponized smallpox.

336
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,990
伙计们  我先给你们上点水
Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water.

337
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,610
你们要看菜单吗  还是已经想好要点什么了
You need menus or you know what you want?

338
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,550
莱纳德知道自己想要什么
Leonard knows what he wants,

339
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,690
不过看来从你这是捞不着了
but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

340
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,180
霍华德
Howard.

341
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,930
不  没事  伯纳黛特
No, that's okay, Bernadette.

342
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,230
有些人就是不适合在一起
Sometimes these things just don't work out.

343
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,670
没错  不过没关系
Yeah, it's all good.

344
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,560
我们  我们对彼此的感觉永远不会变
We-We'll always have feelings for each other.

345
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,030
还真是不错啊
Oh, that's nice.

346
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,830
看吧  她也知道"永远"的含义
See, she knew what "always" meant.

347
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,110
你就是得理不饶人是吧
Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?

348
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
我只是想证明我的观点而已
I'm just making a point.

349
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
你不知道该何时放手的观点吗
Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?

350
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,660
够了  够了
People, people,

351
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,560
拜托  在你俩开始说一些会后悔的话时
please, before you say something you both regret,

352
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,350
我想先点菜
I'd like to place my order.

353
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,300
好的  稍等  谢尔顿
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon.

354
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,690
你知道咱俩为什么不能做情侣吗
You know why we can't be together?

355
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,220
因为对的永远你  错的永远我
Because you always have to be right.

356
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,770
才不是呢
Oh, that is not true.

357
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,040
这点我认同莱纳德
I got to go with Leonard on this.

358
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,290
他是我认识的人中犯错最多的
He is wrong more than anyone I know.

359
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,210
我刚想起来现在是我的休息时间
You know what? I just realized I'm on a break.

360
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,880
我叫别人过来给你们点单
I'll get someone else.

361
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,000
莱纳德  你要保证等我们下一个女招待过来以后
Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over,

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
你绝不可以一会儿跟她玩复合
you will not start a complicated on-again,

363
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,370
一会儿跟她玩翻脸的恋情
off-again relationship with her,

364
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,270
因为我现在非常非常饿
because I am very, very hungry.

365
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,380
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

366
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,140
你想解释一下你在餐厅里的时候
Mind explaining to me why you were being

367
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,560
表现得像个混蛋一样吗
such a jerk at the restaurant?

368
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,630
我那是努力装作咱们没有复合
I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other.

369
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,900
-这不是咱俩的计划吗  -不是
- That was the plan, right?  - No,

370
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,310
计划是告诉他们  咱们决定只当朋友
the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends.

371
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,480
你整天那么讨人厌
That's a little hard to do

372
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,400
弄得我也很难演下去
when you're always being such a tool bag.

373
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,840
我用不着站在这听你数落
You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap.

374
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,430
你这是去哪呀
The hell do you think you're going?

375
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,550
咱俩现在不就是一吵完架就上床吗
Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?!

376
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,680
好吧  说得没错
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

377
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,300
我们这是干嘛啊
What are we doing?

378
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,600
什么意思
What do you mean?

379
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,800
我每次幻想到咱俩在一起的场面  结局总是很糟
Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.

380
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,800
那是因为你总是想得太多
That's because you overthink everything.

381
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,970
<i>莱纳德  你在听我说话吗</i>
<i>Leonard, are you listening to me?</i>

382
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,520
什么  我在听啊
What? Yeah.

383
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,450
这简直就是个灾难
This is a disaster.

384
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,720
我分明订的是
I distinctly ordered

385
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,640
伦纳德·尼莫伊版的史波克纸模
the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

386
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,120
扎克瑞·昆图站在我的床脚
Why would I feel safer

387
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,410
怎么能让我觉得安全呢
with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

388
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,750
不知道啊  可是他演《英雄》的时候挺威猛的啊
I don't know, he was pretty badass on <i>Heroes.</i>

389
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,000
也是  那我就给他一次机会吧
You're right, I'll give him a shot.

390
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,670
等一下
Hang on.

391
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,720
佩妮  你今天的晚饭有安排吗
Penny, do you have plans for dinner?

392
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,130
怎么了  你们要去什么好地方吗
Why, you guys going somewhere?

393
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,570
不是  就咱俩单独吃
No, I mean just you and me.

394
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,740
你有认真考虑过才问我的吗
Uh, have you thought this through?

395
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,290
对  而且我认为我们必须去
Yes, and I think we should go anyway.

396
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,920
不行  我还是做不到
No, can't do it.

397
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,600
抱歉  昆图  你还是滚回去吧
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.

398
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,360
如果你跟莱纳德复合了
If you and Leonard get back together,

399
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,980
就终于有人可以跟我和谢尔顿
Sheldon and I will finally have someone

400
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,500
出去四人约会了
to go on double dates with.

401
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,280
不能跟我和霍华德出去吗
What about me and Howard?

402
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,790
好吧  我们也可以跟你们四人约会
Fine, we can double with you, too.

403
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,230
太没安全感了
So insecure.

404
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,690
你们俩要去哪吃饭
Where are you guys going to eat?

405
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,500
佩妮
Penny?

406
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,880
佩妮  你愿意接受莱纳德作为你的合法丈夫吗
Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?

407
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,780
我现在说不愿意
