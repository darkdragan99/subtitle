1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,520
这个退休派对真不错
It was a nice retirement party.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,700
是啊
I guess.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,560
不过还是挺可惜的
Still, it's a shame

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,590
罗斯曼教授是被迫退休的
Professor Rothman was forced to step down.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,280
学校也没办法啊
What choice did the university have?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,160
他已经精神崩溃了
He snapped.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,000
理论物理学家不都这样吗
It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,080
我想知道谢尔顿还有多久才崩溃
I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,920
这几个虾仁大小都一样
These shrimp are all the same size.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,530
吃的时候都找不到一个有逻辑的次序
There's no the logical order to eat them in.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,040
没多久了
Can't be very long.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,970
看啊  这是罗斯曼的办公室人去楼空
Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,480
-真可悲  -对啊  -超可悲的
- Sad. Mm, indeed. - Yeah. - So sad.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,790
归我了
Dibs.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,970
各位好呀
What's up, fellas?

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,830
你在这儿干嘛  克莱皮克
What are you doing here, Kripke?

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,350
量一量我的新办公室该装多大的窗帘啊
Ah, measuring my new office for drapes.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,300
这不是你的新办公室
This is not your office.

19
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,810
归谁还不一定呢
It hasn't been assigned yet.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,280
早在圣诞节派对上
Well, I called dibs at the Christmas party

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,900
罗斯曼教授试图跟玩具盒里的公仔做爱时
when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,010
我就说了这里归我了
with the Toys for Tots collection box.

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,920
归你
Dibs?!

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,260
咱这儿可是堂堂的大学  不是游乐场
This is a university, not a playground.

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,500
办公室可不会因为
Offices are not assigned

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,110
谁喊归谁就归谁
because someone called dibs.

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,930
你刚就喊了
You just called dibs.

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,090
闭嘴
Shut it.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,770
办公室的分配得根据资历来
Offices are assigned by seniority.

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,630
我先来的学校
I arrived at the university first.

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,390
我先来的办公室
I arrived at the office first.

32
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,640
我就是传说中的"早起的鸟儿"
I'm the proverbial early bird.

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,990
诸位
Gentlemen.

34
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,010
罗斯曼教授
Professor Rothman.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,790
晚上好
Good evening.

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,750
真好  现在又开始流行戴帽子了
I'm glad that men are wearing hats again.

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,040
真的显得很高贵
They're so distinguished.

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,360
生活大爆炸第五季第十七集

39
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,720
我有样小东西要送给你
I got you a little something.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,170
小东西
A little something?

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,910
哇  这个...
Oh, it...

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,870
这也太大了吧
Oh, this is huge.

43
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,860
你对我的帮助才叫大呢
What's huge is what you've done for me.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,500
别啊  艾米  我从没帮过你什么
Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,720
不  在认识你之前  我是一个在舞会上坐冷板凳的胆小鬼
No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower.

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,970
可你看看我现在
But look at me now.

47
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,760
就像那种热衷于各种派对的城市潮女
I'm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl.

48
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,290
有闺蜜  有男友
With a posse, a boyfriend

49
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,700
还有一个能镇住全场的新蕾丝文胸
and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things.

50
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,150
快打开  快打开
Open it. Open it.

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,530
好吧
Okay.

52
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,200
我想送你一件前所未有的礼物
I wanted to get you something you didn't have.

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,520
哇
Wow!

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,300
我...我不知道该说...
I... I don't know what to...

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,760
哇
Wow.

56
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,470
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

57
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,770
我喜不喜欢  哇
Do I like it? Wow.

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,140
那你准备挂在哪儿呢
So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?

59
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,960
上帝啊  还得挂起来啊  哇
Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow.

60
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,960
这个嘛  我还得去找个钩子
Um, you know, I'd have to go get a hook

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
还有钉子锤子啥的
and nails and a hammer and...

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,340
-没问题  -瞧
- No problem. - Oh, look.

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,440
你都...
You got...

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,010
你...你都准备好了  哇
You just... you got it all right there. Wow.

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,520
找到他了  在洗手间呢
I found him. He's in the bathroom.

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,660
赛博特校长
President Siebert?

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,770
就不能等等吗
Can't this wait?

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,160
-不好意思  我俩有话要说  -非得现在说吗
- I'm sorry. We just need a word. - Now?

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,270
你们知道我是老板  而且手里还握着二弟呢吧
You realize I'm your boss, and I am holding my penis?

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,680
谢尔顿  咱先出去吧
Sheldon, give the man some privacy.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
真是不好意思  这家伙简直无法无天了
I'm sorry. This guy's got no respect for boundaries.

72
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,000
你们想干嘛
What do you want?

73
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,030
你能亲口告诉这个疯子
Will you tell this lunatic

74
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,390
罗斯曼教授的办公室就应该归我吗
that Professor Rothman's office is rightfully mine?

75
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,500
这种事不能找你们系主任商量吗
Can't you take this up with your department chairman?

76
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,270
找过了  他的助理说他在休假
We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical.

77
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,970
尽管我们清楚地听见了他办公室窗户的开关声
Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,440
二位  我有件要紧事要办
Gentlemen, there's a task I'm trying to accomplish here,

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,640
可我现在却办不了
and I'm having trouble doing it.

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,410
天啊  赛博特校长  我不想危言耸听
Oh, my. President Siebert, I don't mean to be an alarmist,

81
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,530
但是排尿困难可能是
but difficulty initiating a urine stream

82
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,070
良性前列腺增生的症状
could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
如果您感兴趣
If you're interested,

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,470
我可以发给您一个YouTube视频地址
I can send you a link to a YouTube video

85
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,370
它会告诉您如何自己进行直肠检查
that'll show you how to perform your own rectal exam.

86
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,960
小贴士  记得先剪指甲哦
Uh, helpful hint-- trim your nails first.

87
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,600
别理他  赛博特校长
Ignore him, President Siebert.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,380
我相信像您这样的青壮年一定有一个非常...
I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectly...

89
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,420
健康的前列腺
healthy prostate.

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,880
他在拍您的马屁呢[字面为"给您上黄油"]
Oh, he's just trying to butter you up.

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,810
顺带告诉您
And for the record,

92
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,790
黄油可是直肠检查的最佳润滑剂
butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,650
二位  我现在允许你俩自行解决这个问题
Gentlemen, I'm going to allow the two of you to work this out

94
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,880
因为  第一  你俩都是优秀的科学家
because A. you're both brilliant scientists,

95
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,370
第二  至于罗斯曼的办公室归谁
B. as far as who gets Rothman's office,

96
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,020
我他妈一点都不在乎
I couldn't give the furry crack of a rat's behind.

97
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,170
既然我们都来了
Well, as long as we're here,

98
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,670
我也放个水好了
I might as well take a leak.

99
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,990
克莱皮克
Kripke?

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,830
怎么了
Yes?

101
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,450
那是我的专用尿池
You're in my spot.

102
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,130
这画真大
That is big.

103
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,580
超大
So big.

104
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,260
画得好丑
And ugly.

105
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,720
超丑
So ugly.

106
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,520
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
我不知道
I don't know.

108
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,020
你不可以拿下来  艾米会伤心的
You can't take it down. You'll break her heart.

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,740
看看那张脸
Look at that face.

110
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,270
那张让人心烦又抓狂的大脸
That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.

111
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,880
你说有没有可能  我会慢慢喜欢上这幅画
Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
看情况
That depends.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
你会喜欢把你画得像个爷们的画像吗
Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?

114
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,430
好吧  把它撤下来
Allright, it's got to go.

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,170
那你回头怎么跟艾米说
What will you tell Amy?

116
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,640
不如我告诉她
How about I tell her

117
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,310
这画没有把你画进去
the painting makes you feel jealous

118
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,430
让你嫉妒到抓狂
because you're not in it?

119
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,020
不要  万一她也送一幅给我怎么办
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

120
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,690
我已经有张我和霍华德妈妈在威尼斯海滩
I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom

121
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,590
双双顶着满头小辫子的合影了
getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach.

122
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,190
我已经够遭罪了
I've suffered enough.

123
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,480
或者我可以先拿下来
Well, I guess I could take it down

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
等她过来时再挂上去  但这画好重
and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

125
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,280
可惜你不像画中的男人婆那么壮
Oh, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.

126
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,840
看看这个
Would you look at this?

127
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,100
我花了二十五块跟易趣上一个小孩
I paid $25 to some kid on eBay

128
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,940
买了这根手工制作的哈利·波特魔杖
for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

129
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,730
结果他给我寄来根树枝
He sent me a stick.

130
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,210
是他在自家后院捡的一根小树枝
He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.

131
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,460
上面有编号
It's numbered.

132
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,950
还是限量版的呢  太棒了
Limited edition. Nice.

133
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,290
应该是克莱皮克
Oh, that'll be Kripke.

134
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,310
他来这干嘛
What's he doing here?

135
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,010
我们准备像绅士一样解决办公室归谁
We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen.

136
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,090
要是这样还不行  我就在他的茶里下毒
And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.

137
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,930
-库珀  -克莱皮克  请进
- Cooper. - Kripke. Come in.

138
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,580
我正在泡茶
I'm making tea.

139
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,920
要来一杯吗
Would you like a cup?

140
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
我像穿着连衣裙的娘儿们吗
Am I wearing a summer frock?

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,450
不  哥不喝茶
No, I don't want tea.

142
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,430
我们直接谈正事吧
Let's get down to brass tacks.

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,350
好吧  为了保护咱俩的友谊...
Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship...

144
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,690
咱俩不是朋友
We're not friends.

145
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,960
这话有点伤人  不过好吧
Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right.

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,120
众所周知  外交的本质就是妥协
As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise.

147
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
以该本质为指导思想
With that in mind,

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,920
我提出如下建议
I propose the following.

149
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,490
罗斯曼的办公室归我
I will take Rothman's office,

150
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,110
你一边哭去吧
and you will find a way to be okay with that.

151
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,760
不如这样  罗斯曼的办公室归我
How about I take Rothman's office,

152
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,690
而你滚一边凉快去
and you go suck a lemon?

153
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,880
你确定不用我给你倒杯茶吗
You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?

154
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,030
不如你们这样
How about you decide this

155
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,650
用"石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克"来决定
with Rock-Paper-Scissors Lizard-Spock?

156
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,240
这他妈又是什么
What the frig is that?

157
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,530
"石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克"
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

158
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,060
是由互联网先驱萨姆·卡斯发明的
was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass

159
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,890
是对经典游戏"石头剪刀布"的改进
as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors.

160
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,540
萨姆·卡斯万岁
All hail Sam Kass.

161
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,780
万岁
Hail.

162
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,430
怎么玩的
How does it work?

163
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,910
非常简单
Oh, it's very simple.

164
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,630
剪刀剪布  布包石头
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock,

165
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,530
石头砸死蜥蜴  蜥蜴毒死史波克
rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock,

166
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,860
史波克踩碎剪刀  剪刀斩首蜥蜴
Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard,

167
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,860
蜥蜴吃掉纸[同义布]  论文[布]证明史波克不存在
lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock,

168
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,670
史波克使石头蒸发
Spock vaporizes rock,

169
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,540
最后和以前一样  石头砸坏剪刀
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,180
抱歉  再说一遍好吗
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

171
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,320
当然
Well, of course.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,800
剪刀剪布  布包石头
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock,

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,030
石头砸死蜥蜴  蜥蜴毒死史波克
rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock,

174
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,190
史波克踩碎剪刀

175
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,820
剪刀斩首蜥蜴

176
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,320
蜥蜴吃掉纸[布]

177
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,400
论文[布]证明史波克不存在  史波克使石头蒸发
paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock,

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,910
最后和以前一样  石头砸坏剪刀
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

179
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,610
差不多明白了  再说一遍吧
Almost got it. One more time.

180
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,860
没问题  剪刀剪布  布包石头  石头...
Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock...

181
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,390
谢尔顿  闭嘴
Sheldon, stop.

182
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,270
他摆明在耍你
He's screwing with you.

183
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,320
真的吗
Is he?

184
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,930
那好吧
Well, then,

185
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,040
看来谈判陷入僵局了
it seems we have reached an impasse.

186
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
除了跟你决斗  我别无选择了
I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel.

187
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,730
我本该把手套甩你脸上的
I'd smack you with a glove,
中世纪欧洲骑士挑战时把手套扔向对方
对方捡起就表示接受挑战

188
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,400
可上周我刚把冬天的衣物收了起来
but just last week, I packed away my winter things.

189
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,440
现在都21世纪了
It's the 21st century.

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,470
不能随便决斗
You can't have a duel.

191
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,530
等一下  霍华德
H-Hang on, Howard.

192
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,520
巴里  你枪法有多好
Barry, how good of a shot are you?

193
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,310
不是用手枪  是用脑子
Not pistols. Minds.

194
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,560
我们举行知识问答竞赛
A trivia contest,

195
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,450
你来选择知识范围好了
and you may choose the field of battle.

196
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,510
是选择《星际迷航》知识问答
Star Trek trivia,

197
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,630
还是《星际迷航:下一代》知识问答
Star Trek: Next Generation trivia,

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,570
或《星际迷航:深空九号》知识问答
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia,

199
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,480
或《星际迷航:航海家号》知识问答
Star Trek: Voyager trivia,

200
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,350
或者选火车模型知识问答
or model trains.

201
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,910
在知识问答方面你有完全优势
You have a complete advantage in trivia.

202
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,150
你过目不忘
You have an eidetic memory.

203
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,730
再加上  我好久没看《星际迷航》了
Plus, I haven't watched Star Trek

204
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,870
自从发现我家附近的脱衣舞俱乐部
since I discovered the strip club near my apartment

205
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,390
有免费自助餐后就没看过了
has a free buffet.

206
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,720
要找到你俩同时擅长的事情
It's gonna be hard to find something

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,540
实在是困难啊
you're both equally good at.

208
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,820
那你们俩都不擅长的是什么
Is there anything you're both equally bad at?

209
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,390
运动
Sports.

210
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,650
好吧  一对一
All right, this is one-on-one.

211
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,480
谁先投中五个  办公室就归谁  有问题吗
First person to five wins the office. Any questions?

212
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,470
谢尔顿  请说
Yes, Sheldon.

213
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,760
五个什么
Five what?

214
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,570
投中五个球
Balls in the basket.

215
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,740
这算出界了吧
It's out, right?

216
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,560
暂停
Time.

217
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,020
空间不够了
Ran out of room.

218
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,830
还记得以前学校的恶霸
You know all those terrible things

219
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,210
是怎么欺负我们的吗
bullies used to do to us?

220
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,220
记得
Yeah.

221
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,970
我明白原因了
I get it.

222
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,680
喂
Hey!

223
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,470
他故意拿球砸我
He did that on purpose!

224
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,590
不  他没有
No, he didn't.

225
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,790
他要是故意的才砸不中你呢
Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose.

226
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,060
好了  别来一对一了
Okay, uh, forget one-on-one.

227
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,310
这次来自由投球
Let's try a free throw contest.

228
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,310
谁的球先碰到篮筐  办公室就归谁
First person who makes a basket wins the office.

229
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,300
这样太简单了  霍夫斯塔德
Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.

230
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,100
鬼才信
No. No, I'm not.

231
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,750
原力  谢尔顿
Use the force, Sheldon.
源自《星球大战》

232
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,470
原力
Use the force.

233
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,510
我需要更多原力
I'm gonna need more force.

234
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,690
好了  库珀  你的玻璃心准备碎成渣渣吧
All right, Cooper, prepare to have your heart broken.

235
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,960
那算得分吗
Do I get points for that?

236
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,650
好了  已经四十五分钟了
All right, we gave it 45 minutes.

237
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,300
玩腻了  我们来点其他的
It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.

238
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,880
你有什么建议
What do you propose?

239
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,510
数到三
Uh, on the count of three,

240
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,420
你们一起用力往地上拍球
both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can.

241
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,090
谁的球弹得最高  办公室就归谁
The highest bounce wins the office.

242
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,090
你死定了  库珀
Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

243
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,490
别这么自信  克莱皮克
I don't think so, Kripke.

244
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,810
我可是拍橡皮球的高手
I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.

245
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,770
好了  废话少说
All right, that's enough trash talk.

246
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,290
一  二  三
One, two, three.

247
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,160
谢尔顿的弹得更高
Sheldon was higher.

248
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,760
恭喜你  谢尔顿  办公室归你了
Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.

249
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,580
谁才是真正的体育白痴
Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. Now?

250
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,700
这电影真棒
Oh, what a great movie.

251
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,200
真敢相信你没看过《火爆浪子》
I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.

252
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,780
我妈妈不让我看
My mother didn't allow me to watch it.

253
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,040
她担心我看了会加入黑帮
She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.

254
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,650
我得走了
I've got to go.

255
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,030
明天我还得早起
I've got to get up early.

256
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,610
我们公司在测试一种
My company's testing a new steroid

257
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,340
据说不会让睾丸缩水的新类固醇
that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles,

258
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,780
最晚上班的人要负责测量睾丸的工作
and the last one there has to do the measuring.

259
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,470
那我差不多也要走了
I guess I should get going, too.

260
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,690
晚安  画里的佩妮
Good night, painting Penny.

261
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,640
晚安  真的佩妮
Good night, real Penny.

262
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,190
晚安  真的艾米
Good night, real Amy.

263
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,920
你不用对画里的艾米说再见
You don't have to say good night to painting Amy,

264
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,610
因为她一直都在
'cause she's never leaving.

265
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,570
晚安  真的佩妮
Good night, real Penny.

266
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,830
拜
Bye.

267
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,260
晚安  异装癖佩妮
Good night, transvestite Penny.

268
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,180
好了  我要把你拿下来
Okay. Let us take you off the wall.

269
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,080
眼不见  心不烦
Out of sight, out of mind.

270
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,410
真的就好了
I wish.

271
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,960
我能借那部电影吗
You know, can I borrow that movie?

272
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,730
那些唱歌的小流氓真的让我春心荡漾
Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.

273
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,440
当然  你拿去看吧
Sure, sure. Enjoy.

274
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,680
我是说  看完了再还给我  或者...
I mean, get it back to me when you can, or...

275
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,960
实际上  送给你好了
you know what, actually, you keep it.

276
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,350
就当是我给你的礼物
It's just going to be my gift to you.

277
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,590
-谢谢  -拜
- Thank you. - Bye.

278
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,270
等等  那幅画呢
Wait... Where'd the painting go?

279
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,020
在那里
It's right over there.

280
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,030
为什么
Why?

281
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,760
我不知道  那画感觉很怪
I have no idea. That is weird.

282
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,080
-你讨厌它  -没有
- You hate it. - No.

283
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,050
没有没有  只是它太大了
No, no. It's just, it's a little big.

284
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,110
-我觉得自己好傻  -没有  你不傻
- I feel like an idiot. - No, come on, you're not an idiot.

285
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,620
帮我把它挂回去吧
Look, just help me put it back up.

286
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,710
为什么  好等我走了你再拿下来吗
Why? So you can just take it down when I leave?

287
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,430
-我不需要你可怜我  -艾米  别这样
- I don't need your pity. - Oh, Amy, come on...

288
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,690
真庆幸我没做成雕塑
I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.

289
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,020
战利品
Ah, the spoils.

290
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,190
终于知道为什么胜者喜欢战利品了
I see why Victors love them.

291
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,660
我真为你高兴  谢尔顿
I'm happy for you, Sheldon.

292
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,930
同时我也承认  我会怀念和你共享一间办公室的日子
But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.

293
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,160
那是当然
Oh, of course you are.

294
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,300
随时欢迎你来看我
Feel free to drop by any time.

295
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,190
-谢谢  -记得先打电话哦
- Thank you. - Yeah. Call first.

296
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,740
你好
Oh. Hello.

297
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,050
罗斯曼教授
Professor Rothman.

298
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,840
这已经不是你的办公室了
This isn't your office anymore.

299
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,250
你退休了
You're retired.

300
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,690
你应该说  "我看不见你"
I think the word you're looking for is... "Invisible."

301
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,170
我来向你道歉
I came to say I'm sorry.

302
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,250
不用了
Don't bother.

303
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,010
-艾米  别这样  -我太受打击了
- Oh, Amy, please. - I'm so humiliated.

304
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,700
我坐在那里看《火爆浪子》的时候
I sat there the whole time that we were watching "Grease,"

305
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,990
-还以为你喜欢那幅画呢  -我知道
- thinking you liked the painting. - I know.

306
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,100
我从电影的开题
I was a fool from "Summer Lovin'" To the very last

307
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,150
傻到电影的结尾
"Rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong."

308
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
你说的没错  一点没错
You're right. You're absolutely right.

309
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,840
我应该对你说实话
I should have been honest with you

310
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,450
我该跟你坦白这礼实在太重了
and told you the gift was too much.

311
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,070
没错  太重
Yes, too much.

312
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,380
因为咱俩的友谊根本不对等
Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical.

313
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,630
显然  我喜欢你多过你喜欢我
I clearly like you more than you like me.

314
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,500
人与人之间的感情
I don't think you can put a number on

315
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
不能用数字来衡量
how much one person likes another.

316
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,490
我送了你一幅十二平方英尺的油画
I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area.

317
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,770
这就是数字
There's a number.

318
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,590
艾米  拜托...
Amy, come on...

319
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,180
你要是不喜欢用英尺作单位  我可以换成美元
If you don't like feet, you can try dollars.

320
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,100
这幅画花了我三千美元
The painting set me back three grand.

321
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,590
三千...  我的天
Three gr... Oh, my God!

322
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,100
艾米
Look, look, Amy,

323
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,790
记住  你一直都是我的朋友
all you need to know is, you are my friend

324
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,860
我不想失去你
and I don't want to lose you out of my life.

325
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,030
抱歉  现在你说话我可不敢相信
I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.

326
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,250
拿上锤子  咱们走
Grab your hammer.

327
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,310
没用  心已经碎成渣了
No. Damage is done.

328
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,570
好吧  本来我不想说的
Okay, look, I didn't want to say this,

329
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,640
但我把画摘下来的真正原因是...
but the real reason I took the painting down was...

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,880
伯纳黛特一看见  就嫉妒得牙痒痒
because it made Bernadette very jealous.

331
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,280
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness,

332
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,680
我怎么就没注意到呢
how could I have not seen that?

333
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,440
这幅画简直就是
The painting is

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,520
在不停地提醒她  咱们三人中
a constant reminder that of the three of us,

335
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,420
就她最逊
she is the least cool.

336
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,480
对  没...没错...所以...
Yeah, that's... that's what it is, so...

337
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,120
你真是太善良了
You have such a good heart.

338
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
是啊...我尽力而为
Yeah... I try.

339
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,160
走
Come on.

340
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,880
咱们要去哪儿
Whoa, whoa, where are we going?

341
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,510
去把这幅画挂回你家墙上
We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.

342
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,540
-那伯纳黛特怎么办  -管她呢
- Well, what about Bernadette? - Oh, screw her.

343
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,480
带她玩就算给她天大的面子了
She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

344
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,410
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

345
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,570
我在努力提升这屋的温度
I'm trying to raise the temperature in here

346
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,660
太凉了  我激凸得都要扎破衬衫了
before my nipples tear through my shirt.

347
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,030
把空调调高点不就行了
Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?

348
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,400
问得好
Aha! Good question.

349
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,930
我发现我新办公室的空调开关
It turns out the thermostat for my new office

350
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,320
不在这个屋  对  在隔壁屋
isn't in my new office. No. It's next door,

351
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,300
达文波特教授的办公室里
in Professor Davenport's office,

352
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,120
而她正经受着更年期一波又一波的潮热
who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.

353
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,150
这里怎么有个洞
Why is there a hole here?

354
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,250
我新办公室为什么会有个洞呢
Why is there a hole in my new office?

355
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,440
我排除到只剩2种可能性
I've narrowed it down to two possibilities:

356
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,340
一种可能是墙里有什么东西
"There was something in the wall

357
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,540
而墙外有人想得到
that someone outside the wall wanted,"

358
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,090
另一种更让人心烦
or the more disturbing,

359
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,100
就是墙里有什么东西想出来
"There was something in the wall that wanted out."

360
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,740
好吧  至少你终于有可以打开的窗户了
Well, at least you finally got a window that opens.

361
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,420
多好啊
That's nice.

362
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,540
是吗  请听
Is it? Listen.

363
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,610
怎么了  难道你不喜欢风铃吗
What, you don't like wind chimes?

364
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,520
不喜欢  讨厌死了  而且还有更糟的呢
No, I hate them, but it gets worse.

365
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,880
-听到了吧  -你是说鸟叫吗
- There it is. - The bird?

366
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,740
跟风铃声完全不搭
It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.

367
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,460
那又如何
So?

368
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,640
你还没明白吗
You don't get it, do you?

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,770
窗外那是只知更鸟
That's a mockingbird.

370
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,940
这种鸟啼声婉转曲调多变
Mockingbirds can change their song,

371
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,420
也就是说它唱跑调是故意的
which means he's out of tune on purpose.

372
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,830
它故意气我
He's mocking me.

373
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,670
天啊  又来了  你们感觉到了吗
Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?

374
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,050
渐渐感觉到你是个
The growing realization

375
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,930
性格古怪的王八蛋吗  我们感觉到了
that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

376
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,600
才不是呢  我是说这个振动
No. The vibration.

377
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,940
这办公室正好在地质实验室下面
We are directly underneath the geology lab,

378
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,320
他们又开了那个讨厌的振动筛
and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again.

379
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,430
喂  你们这些石猴子
Hey, gravel monkeys,

380
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,390
想筛石头  直接用自己脑袋摇着筛吧
if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!

381
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,760
谢尔顿  淡定
Sheldon, relax.

382
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,070
你让我怎么淡定
How can I relax?

383
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,000
我的神经系统紧绷得就像竖琴弦
My nervous system is being stretched out

384
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,690
被这些事不停拨弄  墙洞  小鸟
like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds

385
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,170
风声  还有那个总亮出他下垂的蛋蛋
and wind and the low-hanging scrotum

386
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,390
整天阴魂不散的罗斯曼教授
of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.

387
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,110
你要是这么不开心
If you're not happy,

388
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,260
干嘛不把办公室给克莱皮克
why don't you just let Kripke have the office?

389
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,470
难不成把革命成果拱手相让
Wait, and let him win?

390
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,280
你觉得我疯了吗
Do I look crazy to you?

391
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,040
我们楼下还要思考呢
We're trying to think down here,

392
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,640
你们这帮研究石头的技工
you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!

393
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,180
还有你...
And you...

394
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,700
C调  D调  E调  G调  还有A调
the notes are C, D, E, G and A.

395
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,570
挑一个好好唱  不然我就砍了你的树
You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!

396
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,650
怎么样
How's that?

397
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,230
右边再高点
Little higher on the right.

398
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,070
-行吗  -再高点
- Now? - Little more.

399
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,470
别动了  就这样
No. That's got it.

400
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,940
对  好  挺...挺好
Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.

401
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,310
告诉你个小秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.

402
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,800
一开始画的咱俩是裸体的
Originally we were painted nude.

403
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,850
但是我让画家填上衣服了
But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought

404
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,490
我觉得没必要发掘咱们的同性恋潜质
it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.

405
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,920
没错  改得好
Yeah, good call.

406
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,630
不过  你要是改主意了
But if you ever change your mind, all it would take

407
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,510
只需来点温肥皂水和几块海绵[共浴]
is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.

408
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,970
-你是说洗掉画上的衣服吗  -当然
