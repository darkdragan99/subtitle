1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,360
空空如也的盒子
Completely empty box.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,670
你们可以检查一下
If you'd like to examine it...

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,990
好啊
Mm-hmm. Yep.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,240
盒子里除了空虚的童年时光  空无一物
I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,260
吐槽过分了吧  学大提琴的
Little snarky there, cello Lessons.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,890
这里还有一个十分普通的圆筒
And we have this completely ordinary cylinder.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,350
你们也可以检查一下
If you'd like to examine it...

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,520
看似普通  不过我感觉到它
Ordinary, yet I sense it is

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,670
隐隐散发的魔力了
dripping with magical potential.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,040
哦  真要命
Oh, dear Lord.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,850
人家只是走开了一下  清了清肠子
A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,410
顺便追一下斗篷战士[蝙蝠侠别称]的冒险之旅
and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,370
再出来就发现家里
only to emerge and discover his apartment

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,240
卡巴莱酒馆:  有歌舞表演的酒馆
赫然变成卡巴莱酒馆了
has been transformed into a cabaret.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,910
谢尔顿  他是在为他表弟的
Sheldon, he's just practicing for

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,150
生日派对提前排练啦
his cousin's birthday party.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,020
正如我所说
As I was saying...

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,990
空盒子  空圆筒
empty box, empty cylinder,

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,020
然后呢
and... ooh!

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,660
瞧啊
Voila.

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,930
我跟你讲  哥们  霍格沃茨特快的
I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat on

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,470
车厢中  肯定有你的一席之地
the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,080
你就准备用这种方式
This is how you're going to entertain

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,600
娱乐你的小表弟和他朋友吗
your little cousin and his friends?

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,950
靠蒙骗他们
By lying to them?

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,750
这怎么能是骗呢
How is this lying?

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,570
魔术表演本来就是充满了坑蒙拐骗
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition.

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,850
"这是一顶普通的礼帽哦"
"This is an ordinary top hat."

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,050
"这张牌是你随便抽的哦"
"You've chosen that card freely."

30
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,680
"我的屁眼里可没夹着开锁工具哦"
"I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister."

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,490
你就不能享受一下奇迹的瞬间吗  谢尔顿
Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon?

32
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,180
干吗一定要窥探揭秘呢
Why must you peek behind the curtain?

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,810
或是窥探人家的屁屁
Or up the butt?

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,820
跟小朋友说  帽子里变出了兔子
If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,210
将会荼毒他们的批判性思维能力
by telling them that rabbits come out of hats,

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,570
他们成年后会相信占星术和顺势疗法
then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy

37
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,620
导致瑞安·雷诺兹就因此比
and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice

38
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,520
卖萌小混混  内森·菲利安更适合演《绿灯侠》
for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,200
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
他只不过是给孩子们表演一点魔术而已
he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids.

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,730
不会害那些孩子长大变成
I really don't think they're gonna end up

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,480
喜欢雷诺兹版《绿灯侠》的白痴
liking the Green Lantern movie.

43
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,460
别对他这么凶嘛
Don't be so hard on him.

44
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,570
他这么烦躁有情可原  因为他...
It's natural to be a little cranky when you have...

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,910
耳朵里有25美分
a quarter in your ear!

46
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,250
硬币塞在别人身上一点都不好笑
Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement.

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,970
我五岁时  比利·斯巴克斯将一枚
When I was five, Billy Sparks put

48
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,150
墨西哥比索塞进了我的鼻子
a Mexican peso up my nose.

49
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,830
等一下  这哪里不好笑啊
Wait-wait-wait, how is that not amusing?

50
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,770
到现在还没弄出来
It's still there.

51
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,900
害我每次要耗费45分钟才能过机场安检
Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,670
瞧  我把谢尔顿给变没了
Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,840
下次就用把他变不见为开场吧
Next time, you should open with that.

54
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,910
生活大爆炸第五季第十二集

55
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,390
哎呀  那边在约会的是谁啊
Ooh, look who's out on a date.

56
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,270
是帕萨迪纳市的超人气金童玉女  谢米组合
Pasadena's favorite power couple, Shamy.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,360
她刚才回答之前的那问题了
And that is the answer to the question,

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,930
"为什么来芝士蛋糕工厂吃饭是错误的选择"
what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?

59
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,810
今晚是有值得特别庆祝的事情吗
So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,010
是的
Oh, yes.

61
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,920
我们的恋爱协议明确规定了
Our relationship agreement specifies

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,640
每个月的第二个星期四
that the second Thursday of every month,

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,190
如一个月有五个周四  则第三个星期四
or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays,

64
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,560
便是约会之夜
is date night.

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,970
好一段热情如火的感情啊
That is so hot.

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,630
好了  如无异议  上一次约会的概要记录
All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date

67
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,200
就算是已经阅毕并同意通过了
are considered read and agreed to.

68
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,430
有什么新事宜吗
Any new business?

69
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,780
你今天过得怎么样
How was your day?

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,200
棒极了
Superb.

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,570
今天早上我用字母麦片
This morning I made a palindrome

72
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,850
拼成一句回文
with my Alpha-Bits.

73
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,100
"宝宝帽子毛宝宝"
"Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,650
听起来你过得挺不错
Sounds like you hit the ground running.

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,840
我自己有一件好消息
I have a bit of good news myself.

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,230
我最近撰写的论文
My most recent paper

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,160
主题是协同性长时程增强
on how a cooperative long-term potentiation

78
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,270
何以找出神经元树突的记忆序列
can map memory sequences in dendritic branches

79
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,490
成功上了《神经元》杂志封面了
made the cover of Neuron.

80
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,850
哦  说到好消息
Ooh! Speaking of good news,

81
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,960
人家
somebody...

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,040
刚刚有了一百名推特粉丝哦
just hit 100 Twitter followers.

83
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,300
真好
That's nice.

84
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,180
总之  我一直梦想着这一天的到来
Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day

85
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,780
-已经很久很久了  -对啊我也是
- for a long time. - Yeah, me, too.

86
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,510
三位数的粉丝啊  不骗你
Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie--

87
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,860
这感觉太爽了
it feels pretty good.

88
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,510
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

89
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,020
我以唯一作者的身份在著名期刊上发表了
I'm the sole author on a paper being published

90
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,590
自己的论文  而且有可能改变
in a distinguished journal that may change

91
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,030
我研究的这个科学领域
the course of my field.

92
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,270
哎哟  101个了
Ooh, 101!

93
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,400
兴奋得都有些喘不过来气了
Air's getting a bit thin up here.

94
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,310
那么  准备好点菜了吗
So, are we ready to order?

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,890
稍等一下
Give me a minute.

96
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,720
我去整理一下仪容
I'm gonna go wash up.

97
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,620
好奇怪
Well, that's odd.

98
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,290
我们明明进来时就一起去了
We both washed up when we came in.

99
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,810
大概是排尿的委婉说法吧
It's probably a euphemism for urination.

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,830
谢尔顿  你有毛病啊
Sheldon, what is wrong with you?

101
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,460
没大有  当然  要说缺点的话
Not much. Although, I can be faulted

102
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,990
我就是太过于喜欢考拉熊了
for being overly fond of koala bears.

103
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,340
我也不知道怎么回事
I don't know what it is,

104
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,140
每当看到它们在桉树上大嚼特嚼时
when they start munching on eucalyptus,

105
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,920
我整个人都融化了
I just melt inside.

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
艾米刚告诉你一个好消息
Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news,

107
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,610
而你却表现得毫不在乎
and you acted like it was no big deal.

108
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,640
我知道你为什么会困惑
Oh, I see why you're confused.

109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,780
她的消息听上去很重要  可你忘了
No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is,

110
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,630
那是生物学领域的成就
it was an achievement in the field of biology.

111
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,100
都是恶心黏黏的东西
That's all about yucky, squishy things.

112
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,560
亲爱的  她生气了  你是他男朋友
Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend.

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,140
你至少也该试着
You have to at least try to be excited

114
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,400
为她高兴的事而高兴吧
by the things she's excited by.

115
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
如果我就是高兴不起来呢
What if they simply don't excite me?

116
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,910
那就想想考拉  然后笑一个
Well, just smile and think about koalas.

117
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,880
她立马就能识破
She'd see right through that.

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,330
我们经常去动物园
We go to the zoo all the time.

119
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,370
她知道我看考拉的脸
She knows my koala face.

120
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,900
以备将来参考  就是这样
And for future reference, it's this.

121
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,470
你有这么多魔术道具啊
Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.

122
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,180
对
Yeah.

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,980
我十几岁就开始玩魔术
I started when I was a teenager.

124
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,320
当年觉得可以先用小魔术泡妞
I thought I could show a girl a few tricks

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,430
再邀请她来房里看更多"好戏"
and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.

126
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,130
有用吗
Did it work?

127
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,740
这么说吧  唯一一"根"
Ah, let's just say the only wand

128
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,220
有看到好戏的"棒子"  是这根
that ever saw any action was this one.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,240
看我妈为我们的表演做的
Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.

130
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,770
这布料不错啊
I like the fabric.

131
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,830
她从哪得来的
Where'd she get it?

132
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,730
她把一条旧泳衣剪了
Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits.

133
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,440
她做了这两件背心和六张餐巾
She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.

134
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,060
她试了背心吗
Has she tried on the vest yet?!

135
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,690
我刚拿给她
I just gave it to her!

136
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,840
希望能合身  她身材不好量
I hope it fits-- she has a tricky figure!

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
跟我一样又矮又巨乳
She's short and stacked, like me!

138
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,630
她才不算巨乳  老妈  她不会踩到自己的胸
She's not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!

139
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,820
华仔  我可能不太适合
Listen, Howie, maybe I'm not the best choice

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,510
当魔术师助手
to be a magician's assistant.

141
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,210
你肯定行  把那些环递给我
You'll do fine. Hand me those rings?

142
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,290
瞧  你做得多好
See? You nailed it.

143
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,860
我只是不太喜欢跟小孩子在一起
You know, i-it's just that I'm not that comfortable with little kids.

144
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,070
那是因为你很少跟他们玩
Well, that's because you haven't been around them much.

145
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,980
这是练习的好机会
This is good practice. I mean,

146
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,560
你总有一天要做妈妈的嘛
you are gonna be a mom someday, right?

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,460
这倒是
Yeah, sure.

148
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,800
我好久没看过这个了
I haven't seen this trick in years.

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,470
这叫鸽子锅
It's called the dove pan.

150
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,630
先让观众看锅是空的
You let everyone see the pan is empty,

151
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,390
但其实盖子里有个暗格
but there's a secret compartment in the lid.

152
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,430
然后打开变出一个活的...
And then you open it and produce a live...

153
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,950
千万别看里面
Don't look in there.

154
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,550
在玩死亡救赎呢
Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?

155
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,610
对
Yes.

156
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,880
你怎么不做任务啊
How come you're not doing a mission?

157
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
只在那闲逛
You're just wandering around.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,740
今晚被郁闷了
Had a rough night.

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,470
我想散散步  清静一下
I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.

160
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,250
正常人会出门散步
Some people go outside and do that.

161
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,870
已经过九点了  这时候的帕萨迪纳街头
It's after 9:00-- at this hour the streets of Pasadena

162
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,100
到处是喝醉的水手和野猫
are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.

163
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,180
要不要谈一谈
You want to talk about it?

164
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,210
不要
No.

165
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,800
我还是进这家酒馆
I think I'll just go in this saloon

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,860
借酒浇愁吧
and drink my troubles away.

167
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,520
电子酒精是解决不了问题的
You know digital alcohol is never a solution.

168
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,950
出什么事了
What's going on?

169
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,440
说出来也没人信
Hard as this may be to believe,

170
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,440
我可能不是当男朋友的料
it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material.

171
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,490
幸好我是坐着听的啊
Glad I was sitting down for that.

172
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,630
你跟艾米吵架啦
Did you and Amy get in a fight?

173
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,210
艾米在吵  我可通情达理了
Amy had a fight; I was being perfectly reasonable.

174
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,210
我要喝杯威士忌
I'm gonna have a whiskey.

175
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,500
你要喝点什么吗
Do you want anything?

176
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,370
不行  酒后不能开车
No, I can't.

177
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,600
我一会儿还要玩侠盗猎车手呢
I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later.

178
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,630
我虽然不懂女人
Look, I'm no expert in women...

179
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,120
同意
I'll say.

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,750
人家好心帮你  没必要这么损我吧
That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.

181
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,990
对不起  酒后胡话  你接着说
I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking. Go on.

182
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,110
有时候  你得倾听女人的烦心事
Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them

183
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,790
然后让她们知道你能成长和改变
and then show them that you can grow and change.

184
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,380
屁话  还有别的招吗
Nuts to that. What else you got?

185
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,570
我不知道怎么跟你说
I don't know what to tell you.

186
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,960
买礼物给她呗
Buy her something.

187
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,410
这有什么用
How does that work?

188
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,550
略过任何修复感情的手段
Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection

189
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,450
直接用撒钱来赢回她的爱
and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.

190
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,990
这方法完全是我谢尔顿·库珀的作风
Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.

191
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,900
-不用谢我  -要谢谢你
- Glad I could help. - It's appreciated.

192
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,200
如果你这辈子能再找到一个女人
And if you ever manage to find a woman again,

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,260
我也很乐意回报你
I'll be glad to return the favor.

194
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,120
现在  所有环都
And now, all the rings are

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
神奇地连起来了
magically linked together.

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,580
我未婚妻也戴着一个神奇的环
My fiance's wearing a magic ring, too.

197
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,640
把我的钱都变没了
It made all my money disappear.

198
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,960
哦  对
Oh, ah, right.

199
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,840
现在请看  奇妙霍迪尼的
And now, the great Howdini's
昵称来自大魔术师胡迪尼

200
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,380
下一个神奇幻术
next miraculous illusion.

201
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,600
我们什么时候能吃蛋糕
When are we gonna have cake?

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,070
等你们完全被惊叹之后
After you've been thoroughly amazed.

203
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,780
我们现在就想吃
But we want cake now.

204
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,560
现在不给你们吃  懂了没
Well, you're not getting cake right now, capisce?

205
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,550
好了好了
Okay. Okay.

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,730
现在  我可爱的助手将递给我
Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me

207
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,170
一大罐普通的牛奶
an ordinary pitcher of milk.

208
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,580
我知道这个魔术是怎么变的
I know how you do that trick.

209
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,010
那你知道怎么把嘴闭上吗
Do you know how to pipe down?

210
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,790
好了  现在我要把
Okay, we're going to

211
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,410
这张报纸卷起来
roll up this newspaper.

212
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,590
那个牛奶罐是假的
It's a fake pitcher.

213
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,870
你耳朵被耳屎堵上了是吗
You got wax in your ears?

214
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,780
这男人都说了这是个普通的罐子
The man said it's an ordinary pitcher.

215
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,810
霍迪尼
Howdini.

216
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,270
好的  现在我要把报纸塞进这里
Okay, we're going to stick this in here.

217
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,870
然后把牛奶倒进去
And then I'm going to pour in the milk.

218
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,530
但愿这个魔术会成功
I hope this works,

219
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,770
我可没带多余的裤子来换
because I didn't bring a change of pants.

220
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,390
你看  我谷歌过了
Look, I Googled it.

221
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,370
那就是个假罐子
It's a fake pitcher.

222
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,830
够了
That's it.

223
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,050
你今天没蛋糕吃了
No cake for you.

224
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,570
还有谁也不想吃蛋糕的
Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?

225
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,800
她只是开玩笑而已的  孩子们
She's just kidding, boys and girls.

226
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
每个人都有蛋糕吃
Everyone gets cake.

227
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,450
他不许
Not him.

228
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,800
把罐子给我
Just give me the pitcher.

229
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,190
看好啦
Behold!

230
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,780
带错罐子了
Wrong pitcher.

231
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,920
我就说我跟小孩处不好嘛
I told you I'm not good with kids.

232
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,030
的确
Yes, you did.

233
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,730
我的裤裆好像开始结乳块了
Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.

234
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,790
是这样的  小时候我妈工作忙
The thing is, my mother worked full-time.

235
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,480
弟弟妹妹们都是由我照顾
I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.

236
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,120
所以呢
Yeah, so?

237
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,740
那简直糟透了
Ugh, it was horrible!

238
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,340
又得给他们擦鼻涕  又得换尿布
With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers

239
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,780
整天听着他们扯着嗓子抱怨
and their little shrieky voices, always complaining.

240
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,370
我不想穿衣服
"I don't want to get dressed."

241
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,210
乔伊老是往我嘴里吐口水
"Joey keeps spitting in my mouth."

242
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,200
妈妈不是这样做华夫饼的
"This isn't the way Mom makes waffles."

243
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,180
好吧  那你就把手放进烤饼机里
Well, okay, put your hand in here.

244
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,390
看你喜不喜欢这焦手饼
Let's see how you like this waffle!

245
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,490
好了  冷静点
All right, settle down.

246
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,330
红灯
Red light.

247
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,800
红灯  红灯
Red light, red light!

248
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,150
没事儿  没撞
Okay, we're fine.

249
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,680
对不起
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,660
我知道这话会让我听起来像是个恶人
I know it makes me sound like a bad person,

251
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,560
但我真的不喜欢小孩
but I just don't like children.

252
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,760
不  这点我们都心知肚明
Yeah, no, we all got that.

253
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,070
但是你不觉得如果是亲生的孩子
But don't you think it'll be different

254
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,220
情况就会不一样了吗
when the child is ours?

255
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,930
是啊  等咱们的孩子毁了我的体型
Right, when it's our kid that's ruined my body

256
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,920
吵着我睡不了觉  害得我没工作没前途
and kept me up all night and I've got no career and no future

257
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,940
而且在未来的二十年里毫无幸福可言
and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years,

258
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,620
情况当然是不一样了
sure, that'll be completely different.

259
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,860
是啊
Well, yeah.

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,180
这间珠宝店里的任何一件珠宝
I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store

261
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,630
都不可能比刚才
that Amy would appreciate more

262
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,090
看的那台增湿器更让艾米满心欢喜了
than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.

263
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,340
天啊  我算是知道我说傻话时
Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you

264
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,990
你的感受了
when I say stupid stuff.

265
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,410
怀表
Ooh, a pocket watch.

266
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,160
好吧  我不认为艾米会喜欢怀表
Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.

267
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,410
也许不会  但也许她会喜欢戴怀表的男人
No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.

268
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,400
还在说傻话
Still saying stupid stuff.

269
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,560
她喜欢手镯吗
Does she like bracelets?

270
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,090
她很喜欢她那个刻着
Well, she's very fond of her silver one

271
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,150
"青霉素过敏"的银手镯
that says "Allergic to penicillin."

272
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,030
没准他们这有差不多但是更讲究点的
Maybe they have a dressier version of that?

273
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,070
下午好呀
Well, how are we doing this afternoon?

274
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,720
你们有什么特别的需要吗
Are we looking for anything special?

275
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
没准给这位美女买个戒指
Perhaps a ring for the lady?

276
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,410
拜托  我们才不是情侣
Trust me, we are not a couple.

277
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,970
不好意思
Excuse me.

278
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,270
该嗤之以鼻的是我吧  哪轮得到你
I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out.

279
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,450
你要是泡到我这样的男人  得谢天谢地了
You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.

280
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,680
好吧  你说
Fine, go ahead.

281
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,220
拜托  我们才不是情侣
Trust me, we are not a couple.

282
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,110
抱歉  有什么可以帮到二位的吗
My apologies. How can I help you today?

283
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,560
他跟他女朋友吵架了
He's in trouble with his girlfriend

284
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,030
所以想给她买个礼物
and needs to buy her a present.

285
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,380
好的  就是靠着男人买道歉礼物
Great, trouble with girlfriends

286
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,420
我才供得起我女儿读大学的
is what's putting my daughter through USC.

287
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,250
这是真的钻石吗
Ooh, are these real diamonds?

288
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,720
一克拉等于一百分
是的  槽镶长钻  总重二十分
Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.

289
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
真神奇
Remarkable.

290
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,800
钻石  不过就是结晶状的碳而已
Diamonds, crystallized carbon.

291
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,700
人们每天去杂货店
Every day, people go to the grocery store

292
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,010
买回家的也是碳
and come home with sacks full of carbon

293
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,520
只不过是被人丢进烤炉
in the form of charcoal briquettes

294
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
当火源的炭块
that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire.

295
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,820
可你这只不过有几块
But just because you've got some carbon

296
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,600
分子排列整齐的碳
with the atoms stacked neatly,

297
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,970
你就指望我扔下几千美金来买
you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.

298
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
实际上售价只有七百五十美金而已
Actually, that's only 750.

299
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,280
所有商品都打折
Everything's on sale.

300
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,120
真的吗  给我介绍一下那块怀表吧
Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.

301
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,340
我还在琢磨那件事呢
I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.

302
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,400
我一直觉得我某天会当上爸爸的
I always thought I'd be a dad someday.

303
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,570
我也这么觉得
Oh, me, too.

304
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,660
你好有爱
You're so caring.

305
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,160
我脑海常浮现你把男孩抚育成男人的画面
I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.

306
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,800
太好了  霍华德
There you go, Howard.

307
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,070
看来拉杰会替你生孩子的  问题解决了
Sounds like Raj'll have your babies; problem solved.

308
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,200
一个男人对另一个男人表示关心
Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man

309
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,660
并不意味着是在向他表达
doesn't mean he's displaying the love

310
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,220
那种禁忌之爱
that dare not speak its name.

311
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,460
她明确说了不想要孩子吗
Did she definitely say she didn't want kids?

312
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,420
是啊  她十分不喜欢孩子
Yeah, she doesn't like them.

313
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,150
据我看来  孩子们也不喜欢她
And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.

314
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,400
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,490
我不知道
I don't know.

316
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,410
我无法想象没有孩子的人生
I can't see a life where I don't have kids.

317
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,060
谁都有孩子啊
I mean, people have kids.

318
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,610
就连大金刚都有个娃  小大金刚
I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr.
皆为经典任天堂游戏角色

319
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,160
有个孩子能让他教导如何绑架公主
So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses

320
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,190
和怎么朝那意大利籍水管工丢木桶
and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
绑架公主与朝水管工马里奥丢木桶
皆为大金刚经典游戏内容

321
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,150
但即使你有了孩子  也无法保证
You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids

322
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,490
你就一定会喜欢他们啊
that you're going to like them.

323
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,820
太可怕了  你从哪得来这感触的
Wow, that's rough. Where'd you get that?

324
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,580
我妈最新著作封面上就写了这句话
It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.

325
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,520
或许我和伯纳黛特不合适
Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.

326
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,200
霍华德  虽说海大何患无鱼
Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea,

327
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,640
可我看着你晃着鱼钩钓了这么多年
but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years.

328
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,560
千万别放鱼归海啊
Do not throw her back.

329
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,870
我也不想啊  可这事太破坏感情
I don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.

330
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,020
要是你妈知道你想取消婚礼会如何
What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?

331
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,320
她会气死的
Oh, it'll kill her.

332
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,160
但反过来说  她要知道以后没孙子抱
On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren,

333
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,510
也会气死的
that'll kill her, too.

334
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,690
不管怎么说  我妈会被气死这事我很有信心
So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.

335
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,890
你跟艾米说让她几点来
What time did you tell Amy to be here?

336
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,570
八点
8:00.

337
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,880
谢尔顿  你那挂表太可笑了
Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.

338
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,930
胡说
Nonsense.

339
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,700
我戴着就像列车长
I look like a train conductor.

340
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,090
你用什么借口引诱她过来的
Under what pretext did you lure her here?

341
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,250
我说  想过来坐坐聊聊吗
I said, "Hey, want to come over and hang out?"

342
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,860
很好  你要说了什么有深度的理由
Good, good, if you had said something clever,

343
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,530
她可能就起疑心了的
she might've gotten suspicious.

344
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,570
他在这干嘛
What's he doing here?

345
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,180
他想跟你谈谈
Okay, he wants to talk to you.

346
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,970
可我不想跟他谈
Well, I don't want to talk to him.

347
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,780
现在我对你也很失望了
And I'm pretty disappointed in you, too.

348
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,460
虽然我也气不了你多久
Although we both know that won't last.

349
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,420
谢尔顿  该你了
Sheldon, you're up.

350
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,410
谢谢
Thank you.

351
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,370
艾米  我想跟你道歉
Amy, I'd like to apologize.

352
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,800
你的成就非常惊人
Your accomplishment was impressive.

353
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,420
我以你为荣
And I'm proud of you.

354
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,520
-你用考拉脸想糊弄谁啊  -你看吧
-We both know that's your koala face. - I told you.

355
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
他给你买了礼物
Okay, look, he bought you this.

356
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,710
送我珠宝
Jewelry?

357
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,980
真的假的
Seriously?

358
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,960
谢尔顿  你是我见过最肤浅
Sheldon, you are the most shallow,

359
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,770
最自我中心的人
self-centered person I have ever met.

360
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,160
你真的以为你想操纵...
Do you really think another transparently manipul...

361
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,760
是个皇冠
Oh, it's a tiara!

362
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,570
皇冠  我有了个皇冠
A tiara! I have a tiara!

363
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,390
给我戴上  快给我戴上  给我戴上
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me,

364
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,310
给我戴上戴上戴上
put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.

365
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,800
戴着真漂亮
You look beautiful.

366
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,090
当然漂亮  我是公主  这是我的皇冠
Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!

367
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,820
你说得对  送皇冠太过了
You were right, the tiara was too much.

368
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,870
霍华德  伯纳黛特到...
Howard! Bernadette's...

369
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,480
她从我身边溜过去了
Oh, she slipped right by me.

370
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,660
我来还你的背心
Here's your vest back.

371
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,670
你留着吧
You should keep it.

372
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,600
以后说不定还有机会穿呢
You could wear it again sometime.

373
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,180
去哪穿啊
Where?

374
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,910
不知道  去打猎的时候吧
I don't know, hunting?

375
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,580
别忘了跟她谈谈那件疯狂的事
Don't forget to talk to her about this mishegas

376
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,210
就是我抱不上孙儿的事
where I don't get grandkids!

377
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,550
别担心  老妈
Don't worry, Ma.

378
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,630
我会的  只要我想出怎么
I will, as soon as I can figure out a way

379
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,390
跟她提出这个敏感问题
to bring up such a sensitive issue!

380
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,590
看来你告诉你妈妈了
I guess you talked to your mom, huh?

381
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,520
我当时很伤心嘛
I was upset.

382
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,470
我妈强壮的臂弯还是挺适合靠着哭泣的
My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on,

383
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,550
忽略她灼伤人眼的镇痛剂味道就行了
if the smell of Bengay doesn't burn your eyes.

384
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,570
显然  要孩子这事对你很重要
Look, it's obvious having kids is really important to you,

385
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,240
我想出了一个办法
and I think I came up with a solution.

386
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,560
真的吗
Really?

387
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,310
太好了  是什么
That's great. What?

388
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,070
既然我赚的钱比你多得多
Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway,

389
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,740
让我工作而你在家照顾孩子怎样
what if I work and you stay home with the kids?

390
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,010
-我   -对啊
- Me? - Yeah.

391
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,660
陪孩子看儿童节目《小恐龙巴尼》
You know, you'll watch Barney

392
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,580
帮他们把卡鼻子里的麦片抠出来
and pull Cheerios out of their noses

393
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,920
然后带他们去跟其他孩子玩耍
and go on play dates,

394
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,880
而我出去工作  跟我们的同龄人
and I'll work and have conversations

395
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,830
一起聊天  享受我的人生
with people my own age and enjoy my life.

396
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,330
好啊
Yeah...

397
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,040
太好了  问题解决了
Yay, so we're good.

398
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,410
对  没问题了
Yeah, we're good.

399
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,500
我不知道这次算不算吵架
You know, I don't know if this counted as a fight,

400
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,440
不过想要来个吵后滚床单吗
but how about some make-up sex?

401
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
我喜欢
I would love that.

402
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,380
不过你耳朵后面是什么啊
But what is that behind your ear?

403
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,140
哇  是个安全套
Oh, look, it's a condom.
