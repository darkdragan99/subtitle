1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,770
您这次要参加的是什么样的巡航
So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,110
这次水上之行称为"重生之旅"
It's called the Born Again Boat Ride.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,880
基督教季刊给予了这次旅途最高的评价
Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating--

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,380
五颗荆棘王冠呢
five thorny crowns.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,780
我真希望你能跟我一起去  谢尔顿
I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,650
老妈  如果我去了就等于直接证明
Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,850
您的神真的能造就奇迹
that your God can work miracles.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,960
这你可就错了
You're missing out.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,290
到时候欢乐肯定无所不在
It's gonna be wall-to-wall fun.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,430
全都有主题哦
It's all themed.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,530
届时能看到"约拿和鲸鱼"[圣经故事]
There's Jonah and the Whale watching.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,900
你还能吃到名为"最后的晚餐"的自助餐
All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,300
以及我本人的最爱  "神之恕击"
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,800
我冒昧的问一下  什么叫"神之恕击"
What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,510
说起来非常的有趣
Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,140
首先将你的罪恶写在一个泥制飞靶上
You write your sins on a clay pigeon,

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,310
再用机器把靶子弹射出去
they fire 'em up in the air,

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,610
然后你拿一把12发弹容的散弹枪打爆它
and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,780
充满了神的宽恕啊
full of our Lord's forgiveness.

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,090
老实说  妈妈  我很高兴看到
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,860
你们天主教团思想进步了
how advanced your group has become--

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,590
敢于出海
you are willing to sail out into the ocean

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,490
不再担心地球是平的 船会摔下去
without fear of falling off the edge.
暗讽《圣经》里多处暗示大地是一块平板

24
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,290
打个比方
For example,

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,230
如果谢利在船上  他应该
if Shelly was aboard, he'd write,

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,300
在飞靶写上"牙尖嘴利"
"Smart mouth" on his pigeon,

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,240
然后来个五雷轰顶
and then bam!

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,640
神予之 神毁之
The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,940
老妈  根据我们以往周末的安排
Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together,

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,150
-欢乐应该始于炸鸡  -听起来很美味啊
- the fun begins with fried chicken. - Sounds delicious.

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,150
很好  因为我已经帮你备齐了所有材料
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it.

32
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,080
你有口福了
You are in for a treat.

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,050
我爸的棺材
My mother's fried chicken

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,960
之所以变成加大号的  就是因为我妈的炸鸡美味
is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,620
谢尔顿  她刚下飞机
Sheldon, she just got off the plane.

36
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,360
她不想做饭了
She doesn't want to cook.

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
她当然想做
Of course she does.

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,530
做饭给我吃  是她向我表达"我爱你"的方式
Making me food is her way of saying "I love you""

39
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,800
在她筋疲力尽的时候做给我吃
Making me food when she's too tired to cook

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,870
是她向我表达"我真的很爱你"的方式
is her way of saying "I really love you."

41
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,970
其实我并不介意出去吃  谢尔顿
Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,470
吃那些粗粮
Won't that spoil our appetites

43
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,810
会坏了吃炸鸡的好胃口吧
for the chicken you're going to make me?

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,680
好了  就这么定了  我们出去吃
All right, that settles it, we're going out.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,810
你喜欢吃寿司吗  街上有家小店不错
Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,150
我没吃过寿司
I've never had it,

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,150
不过试试新鲜事物总没什么坏处
but there's no harm in trying something new.

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,050
尝试新鲜事物坏处多了
There's a lot of harm in trying something new.

49
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,650
所以要用兔子来测试药物和化妆品的安全性
That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,560
谢尔顿  你的言行像个疯子
Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,860
其实  他小时候我带他检查过了
Actually, I had him tested as a child.

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,630
医生说他很正常
Doctor says he's fine.

53
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,230
早跟你说了
Told you.

54
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,870
虽然我很后悔没接着去找
Although, I do regret not following up

55
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,100
休斯顿的那位专家
with that specialist in Houston.

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,930
生活大爆炸第五季第六集

57
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,550
欢迎光临
いらっしゃいます

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,720
别瞎嚷嚷了
Stop yelling!

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,130
来这儿我很不开心
I'm not happy about this.

60
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,530
你这辈子什么时候开心过吗
What's the last thing you were ever happy about?

61
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,460
等着吃炸鸡的时候
The prospect of fried chicken.

62
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,430
真令人激动
This is exciting.

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,040
咱家四号公路线那的馆子也卖寿司
Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi,

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,110
但他们只是把炸鱼排切碎
but it's just cut up fish sticks

65
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,710
再配上"本恩大叔"牌速食米饭
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

66
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,370
即使他们用"功夫文"写菜单
They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters,

67
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,480
但假货就假货
but that don't make it sushi.

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,420
额  "功夫文"好像有点种族歧视吧
Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,890
ching chong:外国人模仿中国话发音  变相对亚洲人的种族诋毁的词语
我还以为只有"ching chong"是不能说的呢
Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was "ching chong"

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,360
额  对  那个也不能说
Yeah, yeah, that, too.

71
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
谢利
So, Shelly,

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,090
你和你的朋友艾米进展如何了
what's up with you and your friend Amy,

73
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,530
如果你不介意妈妈窥探点隐私的话
if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?

74
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,600
艾米的确有大进展
Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front.

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
她最近在研究
She's been studying

76
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,440
神经生物学中有关低等生物的上瘾问题
the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals.

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,610
她就差这么一点点  就能让海星迷上可卡因了
She's this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.

78
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,910
你知道他们两个发展的情况吗
Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?

79
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,810
他们俩的关系就像尼斯湖水怪
It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster.

80
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,620
也许事实存在  也许不存在
Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't.

81
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,320
真相可能永远藏在湖里
We'll probably never know.

82
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,620
偷想这问题来惊吓一下自己  还是挺有意思的
But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.

83
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,760
你跟年轻女孩子相处得怎样
How are you doing on the young lady front?

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,630
我听闻你被异地恋困扰着
I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?

85
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,800
是啊  拉杰的妹妹
Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,870
情况比较棘手  她远在印度
It's kind of tough.  She's in India.

87
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,570
她父母也不希望她跟白种人交往
Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.

88
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,870
那真是个有趣的转机  不是吗
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

89
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,040
在约会之前  你怎么没想过这个问题呢
You never think about it going the other way.

90
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,750
有些事情你强求不来
Well, you can't force things.

91
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,420
你应该想想你们是否真的是在交往
You need to figure out if you're in a relationship

92
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,350
还是你们只是名义上的
or if you're just calling it one.

93
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,030
就好像常言道  你可以把米放到电锅里
It's like they say--a cat can have kittens in the oven

94
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,130
不代表米就会成炊
but that don't make 'em biscuits.

95
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,060
这提醒了我另外一句常言
And that reminds me of another saying.

96
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,160
你可以诱拐鸡跳炸锅
You can lead a chicken to Crisco,

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,660
但不代表你能诱拐你妈去炸鸡
but you can't make your mother fry it.

98
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,570
谢尔顿  你再拿鸡的事情烦我
Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken,

99
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,970
我就把你按到我膝盖上  当众打你屁股
I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.

100
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,140
求你烦她吧  就当为了我
Please pester her. Please, for me.

101
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,550
库珀夫人  你觉得寿司如何
So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?

102
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,520
很不错
It was good.

103
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,020
唯一美中不足的是
The only thing that would have made it better

104
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,490
它要是熟食就好了
is if it was cooked

105
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,890
要是夹牛肉 就更棒了
and if it was beef.

106
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,760
谢尔顿  你房东何时能把电梯修理一下
Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,500
我不清楚
I don't know.

108
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,130
最近我们有在商量
Lately we've been talking about

109
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,670
把电梯改造成导弹发射井
converting it into a missile silo.

110
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,340
你儿子似乎觉得
Your son seems to think

111
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,970
咱们得先对伯班克发动攻击啊
we need to launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

112
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,180
先下手为强 后下手遭殃嘛
Get them before they get us.

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,950
看看是谁大驾光临了
Hey, look who decided to show up.

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,020
拉杰  你搞什么
Raj, what are you doing?

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,190
我找不到你们  就买了六个新朋友
I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends.

116
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,600
可惜的是  有三个已经阵亡了
Three, sadly, are dead.

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,070
妈妈  你记得拉杰吗
Mom, you remember Rajesh?

118
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,640
-拉杰  这位是我妈妈  -当然记得  库珀夫人嘛
- Rajesh, my mother. - Of course.Mrs. Cooper.

119
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,370
很高兴再见到你
So nice to see you again.

120
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,770
我也是
Well, it's so nice to see you, too.

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,150
我以为印第安人才偶有酗酒问题
I thought it was our Indians
印第安人和印度人都叫Indian

122
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,310
没想到印度人也会呀
that had the occasional alcohol problem.

123
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,550
这也带歧视  不能说
We don't say that, either.

124
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,760
我回头列个单子给你
I'll make you a list.

125
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,420
你真是太好了  不愧是白人
Oh, that would be mighty white of you.

126
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,260
拉杰  你借酒浇愁
So, Raj, what pain are you trying

127
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,270
是为了什么事
to cover up with alcohol?

128
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,570
没什么  我很好
Nothing, I'm fine.

129
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,800
-是吗  -不  我不好
- Are ya? - No.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
这样好多了
That's better.

131
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,140
说说你有什么困扰
Now tell me what's bothering you.

132
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,240
我好孤独
I'm so lonely.

133
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,840
当然了  孤单的出生 孤独的死去
Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.

134
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,880
人类就是如此悲剧
It's a tragic human condition.

135
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,180
拉杰
Now, Raj,

136
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,450
你快别烦我妈了
if you'll excuse my mother,

137
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,350
她要去给我做核桃派
she's about to make a pecan pie

138
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,280
要是好吃
that'll be so good

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,420
我就暂时不计较炸鸡的事
I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.

140
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,460
谢尔顿  你朋友很伤心
Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'.

141
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,560
这个时候我们该怎么做
What do we do when someone's hurtin'?

142
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,530
给他们倒一杯热饮
Offer them a hot beverage.

143
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,030
而要是他们喝得跟个鬼似的
And when they're drunk as a skunk,

144
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,400
我们该给他们什么饮料
what beverage do we offer?

145
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,530
咖啡
Coffee.

146
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,830
还得要怎样
And what do we do it with?

147
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,380
现在你给我听好
Now you listen to me.

148
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,450
我知道你感觉自己注定是剩男
I know you feel like you can't find someone,

149
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,280
但每个问题都有解决方法
but there's a lock for every key.

150
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,780
以前有个在沃尔玛工作的女孩
Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart.

151
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,920
长得实在太高
Tall, tall girl.

152
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,020
她用钉耙就能把鹅从空中打下来了
Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

153
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,420
她觉得自己找不到男人
Thought she'd never find a man,

154
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,130
但有一天  谁知道呢
then one day, wouldn't ya know,

155
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,560
Harlem Globetrotters 哈林环球旅行者篮球队
哈林篮球队的人来到镇上
Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

156
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,670
长话短说
Long story short,

157
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,870
现在这个女人和一个
today that woman travels the world

158
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,770
半职业篮球选手周游世界
with a semi-professional basketball player

159
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,940
还生了两个漂亮的混血宝宝
and two beautiful mixed-race babies.

160
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,250
虽然因为你的口音问题我没怎么听懂
I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent,

161
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,650
但你的语气很抚慰人心
but the general tone was soothing

162
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,250
我感觉好多了
and somehow I feel better.

163
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,390
我吃不到核桃派了是吧
I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?

164
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,560
你想来点奥利奥吗
You want some Oreos?

165
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
-混合夹心的吗  -不是  普通的
- Double Stuf? - No, regular.

166
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,830
不错  真会在伤口上撒盐
Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

167
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,000
很高兴我们终于可以一起做点事情
I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together,

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,870
-就我们两个人  -当然
- just the two of us.  - Sure.

169
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,000
出来度假还有衣服要洗  真是开心啊
One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.

170
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,370
注意点  你松软剂放太多了
Careful, you're using too much Downey.

171
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,440
要是我衣服太柔软  我穿着会想睡觉的
You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.

172
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,610
这让我想起了以前的日子
Well, this takes me back.

173
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,610
我帮你洗衣服  而你在旁边碎碎念
Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

174
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
很有爱吧
It is nice, isn't it?

175
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,310
库珀夫人
Mrs. Cooper.

176
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,510
你好  亲爱的
Oh, hello, darlin'.

177
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,860
谢尔顿  你都没告诉我你妈妈要来
Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.

178
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,560
我在一周邮件集锦中写了的
It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,300
就在"甜菜季终于来了"
Right between "Beet season is finally here"

180
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,830
和"神马  甜菜根会致癌"这两条中间
and "Uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."

181
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,610
你最近怎么样
So, how've you been?

182
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,740
很好啊
Good, good.

183
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,340
我听说莱纳德交了新女友
I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend.

184
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,880
你感觉怎么样
How are you doing with all that?

185
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
还好啦  已经过了一阵了
Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while.

186
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,610
我已经重新开始物色对象了
I'm getting back out there.

187
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,880
我多嘴问一句  你物色对象的时候
Let me ask you, when you get back out there,

188
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,480
不会是穿着这个吧
are you wearing this?

189
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,920
这个吊带超好看的
Well, it's super cute on.

190
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,790
全靠它别人才免费请我喝酒
That top has paid for itself in free drinks

191
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,390
省下的酒钱都够买十件了
like ten times what it cost.

192
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,260
对  佩妮的钱基本都是靠滥交来的
Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.

193
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,870
亲爱的  你也许该知道
Hon, you think maybe the reason

194
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,900
你一直找不到一个合适的人
why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with

195
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,110
是因为你总让男人们先"上"车
is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster

196
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,310
而不让他们掏一个子儿
without buying a ticket?

197
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,350
不是谁都有福分能"上"云霄飞车
Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster.

198
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,220
没福分的就只能在一旁  玩玩咖啡"杯"
Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups.

199
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,350
我今晚要出去
Now I'm going out tonight.

200
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,760
要是我请你帮我选衣服
Would it be crazy to ask you

201
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,390
这样会不会太疯狂了
to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?

202
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,290
一点也不蠢
Oh, not crazy at all.

203
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,230
别看轻自己
And don't beat yourself up.

204
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,460
我像你这么大的时候
When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride

205
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,030
一瓶草莓酒就能骗我出去兜风了
and a bottle of strawberry wine.

206
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,340
我可不会把这个写进本周邮件集锦里
That will not be in this week's e-mail blast.

207
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,870
今年春天
So, this spring,

208
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
我要出发去国际空间站
I get to go to the International Space Station.

209
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,120
上帝啊  上天堂呀
Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

210
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,620
如果你想在那里定居
If you ever want to live there eternally,

211
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,890
我这有本好书你可以看看
I've got a good book you could read.

212
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,290
心领了  不过我每年都看《查理·布朗的圣诞节》特辑
Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year,
查理·布朗:史努比的主人

213
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,760
所以也不会无聊
so I get the gist.

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,600
-你妈妈肯定很以你为荣  -不
- I bet your mom is really proud of you. - Nope.

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,230
她说如果我不退出
She says if I don't back out

216
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,930
她就要绝食抗议
she's going to go on a hunger strike.

217
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,870
虽然离出现生命危险
It would take years before

218
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,900
得有好几年时间  但我还是于心不忍
she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.

219
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,940
我们明天去好好玩一天  妈妈
I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

220
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,240
我要带你
I'm taking you

221
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,980
Saul Perlmutter 2011诺贝尔物理学家得主
去看索尔·珀尔马特演讲
to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture

222
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
他那赢得诺贝尔奖的宇宙学研究成果
about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology.

223
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,310
但最精彩的部分是
And the best part is,

224
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
在后面的问答阶段
at the Q and A afterward,

225
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,850
我准备了几个问题
I've worked up a couple of "Q's"

226
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,520
绝对能把他问哭
that will stump his sorry "A."

227
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,090
我不确定  谢利
I don't know, Shelly.

228
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,460
我觉得我们可以去观观光
I thought we could do a little sightseeing.

229
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,930
有什么景色能与你儿子
What sight is better than your little boy

230
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,530
让诺贝尔奖得主颜面扫地相媲美呢
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

231
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,570
别这样  谢尔顿  我们可以带你妈
Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom

232
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,300
去看看好莱坞标志
to see the Hollywood sign,

233
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,140
参观蜡像馆  走走星光大道
the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.

234
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,200
也可以去逛逛罗迪欧大道[名牌商业街]
Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

235
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,070
一万二的手袋  我可买不起
Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag,

236
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,940
但用正义的眼光谴责那些
but it's free to look upon those

237
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,510
买得起的人  这倒是不用花钱的
who do with righteous condemnation.

238
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,680
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

239
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,850
我觉得怎么样
What do I say?

240
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,590
我真心觉得我妈来探望我  关你们屁事
I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit

241
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,290
去你的寿司  滚你的悲伤
with your sushi, and your sadness

242
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,490
还有你的放荡小吊带
and your slutty shirts.

243
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,060
你们收手吧
Stop it.

244
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,500
他不是说你  你的衣服密不透风
He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.

245
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,910
这真是美味啊
These are delicious.

246
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,210
煎薄饼的秘诀就是用培根油
The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,520
我做什么都放这油
I cook everything in it.

248
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,350
每样都放吗  你不怕有害健康吗
Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?

249
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,720
医生说话一向自相矛盾的
Oh, doctors are always changing their mind.

250
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,420
这个星期说你不能吃培根油
One week bacon grease is bad for you.

251
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,090
下个星期就说你吃得不够多
The next week we're not getting enough of it.

252
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,560
早上好  谢利
Good morning, Shelly.

253
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,530
妈妈  我要为我昨晚的行为道歉
Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night.

254
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,300
-接受你的道歉  -太好了
- Apology accepted.  - Great.

255
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,840
你会喜欢珀尔马特的演讲的
Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture.

256
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,910
他会说宇宙现在已有六千多年历史
Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years,

257
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,180
我觉得这时你可以用手指塞住耳朵
but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears

258
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,950
然后低声哼唱《奇异恩典》[基督教圣诗]
and hum "Amazing Grace" during those parts.

259
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,680
我还是要跟你朋友出去
I am still going out with your friends.

260
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
可我已经道歉了
But I apologized.

261
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,560
我容易吗我  我又没做错什么
And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.

262
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,390
谢利  从小到大  那些枯燥无味的演讲
Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls

263
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,700
我已经陪你听得够多了
while you were growing up.

264
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,560
我现在要去观光
I want to go sightseeing.

265
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,000
你何不吃点煎薄饼
So why don't you have some pancakes,

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,630
穿好衣服  跟我们一起去
get dressed and come with us.

267
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,770
我不去  你不能逼我
I'm not going, and you can't make me.

268
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,640
你说得对  我不能逼你  你自个儿玩得开心点
You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

269
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,410
那我就一直站在这里  直到你回心转意
Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.

270
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,680
那你就在那儿站一天吧
Well, then you are going to stand there all day.

271
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,550
我还是带上我的培根油闪一边去吧
I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.

272
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,620
真没想到  我妈妈居然要抛弃我
I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.

273
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,890
我没有要抛弃你
I am not abandoning you.

274
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,090
谢尔顿  要抛弃你  我早把你放篮子里
Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket

275
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,460
扔教堂门口了
on a church doorstep.

276
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,130
我要去好莱坞  对着里根总统的蜡像说
I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan

277
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,440
感谢他对国家做的贡献
for his service to our country.

278
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,170
看来我们的母子关系处在十字路口了  妈妈
We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.

279
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,810
看来如此
Well, I guess we are.

280
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,880
不好意思  忘了拿糖浆
Sorry. Syrup.

281
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,350
好吧  妈妈
All right, Mom.

282
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,320
等你进到"瑞普利信不信由你"博物馆
When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum,
在美国田纳西州  纪念Robert Ripley

283
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,720
如果那里有展出情愿扔掉大好机会
if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance

284
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,890
也不愿陪她的天才儿子玩一天的母亲
to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son,

285
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,690
你要相信  因为真有这种妈妈
believe it, because it's true.

286
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,530
我还没...
I hadn't...

287
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,530
听这场演讲真是浪费时间
That lecture was a waste of time.

288
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,530
我还穿尿布的时候
I made more accurate diagrams

289
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,070
用尿布里的物体  在幼儿园墙上画的
of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall

290
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,070
早期宇宙膨胀图都比他的准
with the contents of my diaper.

291
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,680
你是不是病了
Are you getting sick?

292
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,040
不是  只是对那些
No, I'm just allergic to people

293
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,880
平白无故就得诺贝尔奖的人过敏
who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

294
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,980
谢尔顿  你心情不好
Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood--

295
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,690
或者用临床术语说  嘴贱
or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness--

296
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,120
是因为你妈妈没有把你放在第一位
is because your mother isn't making you a priority?

297
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,100
不是  或者用临床术语说  我呸
No. Or to use the clinical term, "nuh-uh""

298
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,130
你确定吗  母婴配对关系
Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond

299
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,470
是灵长类动物心理的基础
is the building block of primate psychology.

300
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,630
又来了
Oh, there it is.

301
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
什么东西到你嘴里都绕回猴子身上
It always comes back to monkeys with you.

302
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,570
除了猴子  还是猴子
Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

303
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,940
谢尔顿  人类也是动物
Sheldon, we're all animals.

304
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,480
虽然你有一些过人之处
And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary,

305
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,850
但说到情绪和人际关系
but when it comes to emotions and relationships,

306
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,250
你跟普通人没什么两样
you're just like everybody else.

307
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,350
你是说我的情绪问题
Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems

308
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,790
跟那些白痴没什么两样吗
are no different than those of a stupid person?

309
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,120
实际上  有些研究表明
Actually, some research indicates

310
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,460
不过分考虑的话
that by not overthinking,

311
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,590
智商较低的人  情绪控制得更好
the less intelligent handle emotions better.

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,170
你确定你不是感冒了吗
Sure you're not coming down with a cold?

313
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,230
是啊是啊  就跟其他人一样
Oh, yes, the common cold.

314
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,400
得那种普通的感冒呀
Just like everyone else.

315
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,640
那样你就爽了  对吧
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

316
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,010
这间挺漂亮的嘛
Oh, this one's sweet.

317
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,750
对你们这种拿着念珠念经的人来说不错了
You know, for your rosary rattlers.
指天主教念玫瑰经时用一串念珠

318
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,950
库珀太太  那些是天主教徒  不是"拿着念珠念经的人"
Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics" not "rosary rattlers".

319
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,240
上帝啊  加利福尼亚怎么这么多条条框框
My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California

320
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,450
还让不让人讲话了
can talk at all.

321
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,690
这真是史上最烂的好莱坞之旅了
This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.

322
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,760
咱有什么办法  谁叫她非要逛教堂呢
What are we gonna do? She wanted to see churches.

323
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,500
教堂里有酒的  对吧
Hey, they have wine here, don't they?

324
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,740
我们印度的神可没有这么强壮的腹肌
None of our gods have abs like that.

325
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,870
没错  这是最后一个坚持做仰卧起坐的犹太人
Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups.

326
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,310
可你看看他的下场
And look where it got him.

327
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,850
既然咱们都来了  何不一块祷告呢
Hey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying?

328
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,880
给这个教堂也添点教堂的气氛嘛
Let's put a little church in this church.

329
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,420
我觉得我们不...
Oh, I'm not sure we should...

330
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,520
很简单的  我教你
It's easy. I'll show you how.

331
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,190
主啊  玛丽·库珀在此
Lord, Mary Cooper here.

332
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,590
我从加利福尼亚州的蛾摩拉城前来膜拜
Coming to you from Gomorrah, California.
蛾摩拉城是圣经中的罪恶之都

333
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,330
我想感谢您
I want to thank you

334
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,030
保佑我的小宝贝谢利
for the blessing that is my little Shelly.

335
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,960
我还想感谢您一直赐予我宽容的力量
I also want to thank you for the continued strength

336
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,930
我才没用圣经把他给拍晕
not to coldcock him with my Bible.

337
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,700
好了  佩妮  到你了
All right, Penny, your turn.

338
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,470
好吧
Okay, um...

339
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,470
好呀  上帝
Hey, God.

340
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,210
最近咋样啊
What's up?

341
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,950
我挺好的  但是
Um, I'm good, but, uh,

342
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,650
您要是能阻止我哥造冰毒的话
it would be a big help to my family

343
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,850
那就是帮了我们家大忙了
if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth.

344
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,190
但是别惊动警察  私下解决就好
But no cops. Be cool.

345
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,290
她还有点太爱她的邻居了
She also goes a little overboard

346
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,630
都爱上床了
on the "love thy neighbor" .

347
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,160
或许可以像解救抹大拉的玛丽亚那样帮帮她
Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene.
被耶稣解救的妓女

348
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,570
莱纳德  到你了
Leonard, you're up.

349
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,530
那个叫沃什么的  你做好准备
Wasserman, you're on deck.

350
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,840
好吧  说啥呢
Okay. I don't know...

351
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,310
现在再求你让我长高点  可能有点太晚了
it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller.

352
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,510
对了  也许你可以帮帮我和我的女朋友
Oh, um...if you could help out with me and my girlfriend.

353
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,650
她现在远在印度  你要是能帮我们一下就好了
She's all the way in India. That would be great.

354
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,020
听见没  恋情烦恼
Hear that? Girl trouble.

355
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,990
看来我们都没想到莱纳德也能交上女朋友
Turns out we were both wrong on that front.

356
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,190
-你呢  -我
- How about you?  - Oh, me?

357
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,560
不用了  我没啥愿望
No. Thanks, I'm good.

358
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,230
我只盼着宇宙飞船别突然爆炸就行
I'm really just trying not to burst into flames.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,370
拉杰呢
Rajesh?

360
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,810
他说他那最后的五磅体重
He says he's having trouble

361
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,940
怎么都减不下去
dropping those last five pounds.

362
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,140
要是我就求主解决  我不敢跟女孩子讲话的问题
Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.

363
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,350
不行  你一次只能许一个愿
No, you only get one wish.

364
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,170
美国著名演员  Martin Sheen

365
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,170
看看咱俩
Look at the two of us.

366
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,200
我  一位受人尊敬的物理学家
Me, a highly regarded physicist.

367
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,340
一两代人里才偶然出现一个的
The kind of mind that comes along once,

368
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,380
超级高智商
maybe twice in a generation.

369
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,880
你呢  就是个普通人
You, the common man,

370
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,520
股票经纪  要不就是吸尘机销售员
tired from your labors as a stockbroker,

371
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,520
再不然就是个擦皮鞋的  累得半死刚下班
or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack.

372
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,860
但是内心深处
But deep down inside...

373
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,430
咱俩也就是一丘之貉
apparently we're just two peas in a pod.

374
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,600
只不过你是个普通的貉
A regular pea,

375
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
而我是个一两代才出那么一个的
and the kind of pea that comes along once,

376
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,430
高等貉
maybe twice in a generation.

377
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,970
下雨了
Rain.

378
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,480
又一个象征着众人平等的标志
Another great equalizer.

379
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,310
雨浇在我这个天才头上
Falling on the head of the brilliant

380
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,310
也浇在你这个凡人头上
and the unremarkable alike.

381
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,860
真有先见之明
Smarty-pants.

382
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,490
库珀太太  你做的饭太香了
Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.

383
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,830
记着我的话  亲爱的
You take notes, darlin'.

384
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,160
拴住一个男人真正的秘诀就是给他做
The real way to get a man is with melted cheese

385
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,030
融化的奶酪和奶油蘑菇汤
and cream of mushroom soup.

386
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,500
虽然他五十岁就挂掉  但在那之前绝对会全心爱你
He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.

387
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,410
给我张纸巾  这张湿了
I need a tissue. This one got wet.

388
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,950
给你
Here.

389
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,450
谢谢  我今天学到东西了
Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today.

390
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,360
你和我  在很多方面
You and I, in so many ways,

391
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,830
除了智商和其他重要方面
other than intelligence and what counts,

392
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,630
其实没什么不同
we're the same

393
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,200
-亲爱的  你生病了吗  -但愿如此
- Sweetheart, are you sick? - I hope so.

394
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,470
如果这都不叫生病  那活着还有什么意义
because if this is well, life isn't worth living.

395
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,770
宝贝儿  你发烧了
Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up.

396
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,010
-赶快上床躺着去吧  -好吧
- We've got to get you to bed.  - Okay.

397
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,470
别担心  妈妈来照顾小宝贝儿
Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.

398
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,510
咱先说清楚  你只照顾自己的宝贝儿
And just to be clear, only her baby

399
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,810
而不是所有这些宝贝儿对吧
and not these other people.

400
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
那当然
Of course.

401
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,450
我想喝蜂蜜茶
Can I have tea with honey

402
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,150
吃去边的三明治  可以吗
and toast with the crust cut off?

403
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,820
你想吃什么都行
You can have whatever you want.

404
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,560
谢谢妈妈  你最好了
Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

405
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,470
天啊  上次我帮你涂药膏的时候
Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,

406
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,380
你还没长出胸毛来呢
you didn't have hair on your chest.

407
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,580
是啊  去年才长出来的
I know, it filled in last year.

408
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,650
你这次来  我都没跟你在一起待多久
I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.

409
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,650
这是谁的错啊
And whose fault was that?

410
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,620
你的错
Yours.

411
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,160
谢利  你已经不再是个八岁的小孩子了
Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore.

412
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,030
咱俩之间的关系不能跟以前一样了
We have to have a different relationship.

413
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,000
不要
No, we don't.

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,730
咱俩之前那样就挺好的呀
The one we have works great.

415
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,230
亲爱的  你是个大人了
Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

416
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,670
没准我是个
Or maybe I'm part of a new species,

417
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,570
寿命长达上百年的新物种呢
that lives for hundreds of years,

418
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,280
也就是说我现在还是个两三岁的孩子呢
which means I'm still basically a toddler.

419
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,240
我当年真应该带你去休斯顿
Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.

420
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,880
也就是说你不会唱《乖乖猫》给我听了吗
Does this mean you're not going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

421
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,500
不  我永远都会唱《乖乖猫》给你听的
No, I will always sing you "Soft Kitty".

422
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,870
乖乖猫  暖暖猫
Soft kitty，warm kitty

423
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,140
小小毛绒球
Little ball of fur...

424
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,570
库珀太太  我们是不是该把那个派
Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie

425
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,650
-从烤箱里拿出来了  -滚
- out of the oven? - Get out!

426
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
这也太没礼貌了
Well, that was rude.

427
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,220
就是啊  不过他也不是故意的
Well, I know, but he means well.

428
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,520
继续唱吧
Sing.

429
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,070
快乐猫  瞌睡猫
Happy kitty,sleepy kitty

430
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,790
你是想偷懒吗  妈
What are you trying to pull, Mom?

431
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,360
从头开始唱
From the top.

432
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,830
我就说他欠揍嘛
This is what I'm talking about.

433
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,190
乖乖猫  暖暖猫
Soft kitty，warm kitty

434
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,610
小小毛绒球
Little ball of fur...
