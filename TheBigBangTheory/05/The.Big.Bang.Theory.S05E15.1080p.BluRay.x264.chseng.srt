1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
搞毛呀
What the hell?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,890
紧急情况预防演习
Emergency preparedness drill.

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,470
-别啊  开玩笑吧  -你懂的
- Oh, no, come on! - Yeah, you know how it works.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,140
每三个月一次  保持警惕
Once a quarter, keep our readiness up.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,890
快起床吧  瞌睡虫
Now, rise and shine, sleepy head.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,680
城里半数  死翘翘
Half the town is probably dead.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,950
我一定要给我的门弄个锁
I have to get a lock for my door.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,670
我觉得你会喜欢今晚的演习
I think you'll like the drill tonight.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,200
我在寓教于乐方面花了不少心思
I've tried to make it fun.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,190
每张卡片上都详细介绍了一个场景
Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,130
每个场景都代表一种可能的末日级灾难
of a possible apocalyptic event.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,030
囊括了从森林大火
Everything from wild fires

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,420
到加拿大的突然入侵
to a surprise invasion by Canada.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,410
选个灾难吧  随便哪个都行
Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,800
谢尔顿  加拿大攻不到加州的
Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,620
真的吗  你真觉得华盛顿州和俄勒冈州的
Yeah, really? You think those hippies

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,460
那帮脓包能挡得住加拿大人吗
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,340
好吧
Fine.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,450
好嘞
All righty!

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,480
"一场8.2级的地震摧毁了帕萨迪纳市
"An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena,

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,750
高楼大厦被夷为平地
reducing mighty edifices to dust,

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,330
火灾在全城蔓延
engulfing the city in flames.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,980
街道上血流成河
The streets flow with blood

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,050
遍地伤者哀嚎不已"
and echo with the cries of the wounded."

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,490
选得好啊
Oh, excellent choice.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,090
快戴上安全帽  穿上安全背心
Now, put on your hardhat and safety vest.

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,310
真有意思啊
Oh, fun.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,910
我又得穿得像"村民"组合里的某位成员一样
I get to spend another night in front of our apartment
70年代的经典男子演唱组合
其中一位经常扮成建筑工人

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,020
整晚上傻站在楼前了
dressed like one of the Village People.

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,270
你每三个月就得这么吐一次槽
You make that joke every three months.

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,260
可我还是没看出槽点
I still don't get it.

32
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,280
莱纳德  等下
Leonard... wait.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,560
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,490
我也不知道  怎么了
I don't know, what am I doing?

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,240
你看看周围
Look around you--

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,800
到处都是可能存在的碎玻璃
there's hypothetical broken glass everywhere.

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,360
不是吧  不带上足部矫形器就去最终决战吗
Really? You're going to face Armageddon without your orthotics?

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,490
你自己看着办
Your choice.

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,790
可能的余震来了
Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,860
所以要戴安全帽嘛
And that's why we wear hardhats.

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,770
生活大爆炸第五季第十五集

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,310
你看这个  来自宇航局的新闻
Check it out-- press release from NASA.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,180
"第31批考察队将于今年春天
"Expedition 31 will launch this spring

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,920
前往国际空间站
to the International Space Station.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,290
队员包括中校"汤包"汤姆·约翰逊
Crew members will include Commander Tom 'Tombo' Johnson,

46
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,120
宇航员"超新星"迈克·诺瓦里克
Astronaut Mike 'Supernova' Novacelik

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,610
和随行专家霍华德·沃罗威茨"
and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz."

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,630
这条肯定要上我的犹太教堂日报
This is going right into my synagogue's newsletter.

49
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,400
哥们儿  如果你打算当宇航员的话
Dude, if you're going to be an astronaut,

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,310
你得取个霸气的绰号啊
you need to pick a cool nickname.

51
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,700
才不用我来取呢
I don't get to pick it.

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,030
别人会给我取的
The other guys have to give it to me.

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,630
如果我有绰号的话  肯定是"劲爆巧克力"
Oh. If I had one, it would be "Brown Dynamite."

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,550
你在听我说话吗
Are you not listening to me?

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,560
绰号只能是别人帮你取
The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,830
你没在看着我吗
Are you not looking at me?

57
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,720
我就是"劲爆巧克力"
I am Brown Dynamite.

58
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,360
你为啥往咖啡里加了六包糖
Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,800
因为食堂里不提供
Because the cafeteria doesn't offer

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,070
小包的甲基苯丙胺[可合成兴奋剂]
little packets of methamphetamine.

61
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,250
昨晚是紧急事件演习对吧
Emergency drill night last night, huh?

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,630
-对啊  -你怎么样
- Uh-huh. - How'd you do?

63
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,080
我来告诉你他怎么样
I'll tell you exactly how he did.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,630
"是否准备充分：差强人意
"Readiness: unsatisfactory.

65
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,910
是否听从指挥：刚愎自用
Follows direction: barely.

66
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,320
是否带有情绪：牢骚略多
Attitude: a little too much.

67
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,390
综上所述
Overall:

68
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,530
他不仅会在灾难中死得很惨
not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno,

69
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,920
他旷日持久的牢骚会毁掉别人的好心情"
his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else's day."

70
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,990
我太累了  脑子都不转了
You know what, I'm so tired, I can't even think straight.

71
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,160
我回去了
I'm going home.

72
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,980
你们哪位愿意待会儿送这位二逼青年回家
Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?

73
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,660
你不能回去
You can't go home.

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,800
你四点钟还得送我去看牙医
You have to take me to the dentist at 4:00.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,130
你就不能自己坐公交去吗
Oh... can't you take the bus to the dentist?

76
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,050
我当然能  问题是回来的时候
Of course I can. It's coming back,

77
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,010
有麻醉剂的后续作用
under the residual effects of the anesthesia,

78
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,910
这才是麻烦的地方
that's the problem.

79
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,070
两年前
Two years ago,

80
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,890
在一次全面牙龈清洗过后  我以为我上了公交车
after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus

81
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,780
醒来却发现自己在墨西哥烈酒游行团车上
but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,470
你洗个牙龈都得打麻药啊
They put you under for a cleaning?

83
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,400
没办法  我急起来会咬人
Yeah, they have to-- I'm a biter.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,970
我不管了  谢尔顿  我累得不行了
Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted.

85
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,490
我没法带你去看牙医了
I'm not taking you to the dentist.

86
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,510
不行啊  哥们儿
Wrong, sir.

87
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,870
不行  根据室友协议的第37条B款
Wrong. Under Section 37-B of the Roommate Agreement--

88
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,160
"杂项职责"  你有义务
"Miscellaneous Duties"-- you are obligated

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,310
带我去看牙医
to take me to the dentist.

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,610
看到了吧  就在"为可能坏掉的乳制品
See? It's right here after "providing a confirmation sniff

91
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,610
提供气味确认"这条的后面
on questionable dairy products."

92
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,360
你挺好  我受够了室友协议
You know what, I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.

93
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,060
傻透了
It's ridiculous.

94
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,250
我是你的室友  不是你的司机
I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur.

95
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,810
我昨天本来有别的事情要做
You know, I had better things to do yesterday

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,640
结果却得载你去加登格罗夫的一家
than drive you all the way to the "good" model train store

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,700
"不错"火车模型店  就因为帕萨迪纳的那家
in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena

98
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,340
"服务态度太傲慢了"
has gotten "too big for its britches."

99
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,180
确实很傲慢
Well, it <i>has.</i>

100
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,820
你去问问啊
Ask anybody.

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,780
我才不管呢  我受够了
I don't care. I'm done.

102
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
等下
Hold on.

103
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,290
你是说你想使用第209条吗
Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?

104
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,330
我不知道那条是啥
I don't know what that is,

105
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,680
但如果那条能让我回家睡觉的话  我就用
but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.

106
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,010
你先想清楚
Think carefully here.

107
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,490
第209条会终止我们的友谊
Clause 209 suspends our friendship,

108
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,290
并解除室友协议  仅剩一些基本条款
and strips down the Roommate Agreement to its bare essentials.

109
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,120
我们对彼此的义务仅限于交房租  共用生活设施
Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,070
和在大厅里见面时出于认识
and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition

111
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,250
而冷漠地抬个头
as we pass in the hall.

112
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,350
哟
'Sup?

113
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
我要在哪签名
Where do I sign?

114
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,040
就这里
Right here.

115
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,650
用手指即可
Use your finger.

116
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,590
-签好了  -好的  到此结束
- There. Done. - All right. That's it.

117
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,460
从此你走你的阳关道
We are now no longer companions,

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,860
我过我的独木桥
boon or otherwise.

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,870
我们现在连点头之交都不是
We are not merely acquaintances.

120
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,720
修改一下《玩具总动员》的金句
To amend the words of <i>Toy Story--</i>
源自《玩具总动员》的主题曲
"You've got a friend in me[我是你的好朋友]"

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,540
"我不是你的好朋友"
"You have not got a friend in me."

122
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,150
我要回家小睡了
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.

123
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,840
跟在乎的人说去吧
Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

124
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,360
今天我接到个激动人心的宇航局消息
I got pretty exciting NASA news today.

125
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
下周我就要飞去休斯顿
Next week I fly to Houston

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,710
进行空间定向能力和零重力排便训练
for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.

127
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,660
那是指什么
What does that mean?

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,940
他要去学习如何在太空里拉屎
He's gonna learn to poop in space.

129
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,750
打开分离舱门  哈尔
Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
出自电影《2001太空漫游》的经典台词
哈尔是一台人工智能化电脑

130
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,310
或许你的绰号才应该叫"劲爆屎颗粒"
Maybe <i>your</i> nickname should be "Brown Dynamite."

131
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,670
朋友们好啊
Hello, dear friends.

132
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,320
还有霍夫斯塔德博士
And Dr. Hofstadter.

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,730
哟
'Sup?

134
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,350
哟
'Sup?

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,230
不好意思
My apologies.

136
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,400
我本来可以早点回来
I would've been here sooner,

137
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,500
可那巴士老是停下来载客
but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.

138
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,620
我给你留了个饺子
I saved you a dumpling.

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,650
你对我的关心真叫人感动
Oh, your concern for me is touching.

140
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,810
等你明天载我去看牙医
It will serve you well

141
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,820
我再好好报答你
when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.

142
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,530
对不起  谢尔顿  我很忙
I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy.

143
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,350
我正忙着做瘾疾研究
I'm right in the middle of my addiction study.

144
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,180
整个实验室都是酗酒的猴子
I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,

145
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,340
明天正好要让它们改喝无酒精啤酒
and tomorrow's the day we switch them to O'Doul's.

146
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,090
你是我的女朋友
You're my girlfriend

147
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,210
居然不迎合我的每一个需求
and you're not going to cater to my every need?

148
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,790
哎  爱情的魔力都到哪里去了
Oh, where'd the magic go?

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,460
谢尔顿  女朋友不是这么用的
Sheldon, that's not what girlfriends are for.

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
不过  她们真正的用处你也用不到
Although, you don't use them for what they're for,

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,860
所以我也不知道了
so what do <i>I</i> know?

152
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,650
霍华德就不会叫我帮他买东西
Howard doesn't make me do his shopping

153
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,930
送他去看牙医
or take him to the dentist

154
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,540
帮他拿干洗的衣服  对吧
or pick up his dry cleaning, right?

155
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,690
那当然
Absolutely.

156
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,690
不过等我妈行动不便了  就由你顶上
But when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.

157
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,110
既然艾米太忙  就给你们一个
Well, if Amy's too busy, that gives the rest of you

158
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,180
让我生活更轻松的机会吧
an opportunity to make my life easier,

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,220
我保证带我去的人  能在我那本暂命名为
thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs,

160
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,340
《不客气  凡夫俗子》的回忆录里留一个注脚
tentatively entitled You're Welcome, Mankind.

161
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,780
好了
All right, then,

162
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,480
听到你想接的任务时就吼一声
just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake.

163
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,270
看牙医
Uh, dentist.

164
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,380
没事  我们回头再说这个
Okay, w-we can circle back to that one.

165
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,020
谁想在星期三早上
Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning

166
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,700
带我去换绅士鞋的鞋跟
to get new heels put on my dress shoes?

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,140
谁想去
Anyone?

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,910
看来这个没人喜欢
Oh. That one had hoot written all over it.

169
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,810
好吧  去看皮肤科医生
Um, all right, uh, dermatologist.

170
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,970
过敏症医生
Allergist.

171
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,170
足科医生
Podiatrist.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,340
超级理发师[理发店]
Supercuts?

173
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,610
好吧  还有个好玩的
Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

174
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,780
我要买个新相框
Um, I need a new picture frame

175
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,920
而且我想去吃瑞典肉丸
<i>and</i> I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs.

176
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,320
谁想那天陪我去宜家[瑞典家居品牌]
Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,300
-他们的肉丸很好吃  -你说什么
- Their meatballs are pretty good.  - What's that?

178
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,550
没有  我什么都没说
Nothing, nothing.

179
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,070
你好  斯图尔德
Hello, Stuart.

180
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,430
你好  谢尔顿
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

181
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,180
今天想买什么呀
Can I help you find something today?

182
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,410
不  不
No, no.

183
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,860
我刚刚坐在家里
I was just sitting at home

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,760
想着要能跟我的第九号喜欢人物聊聊
thinking about how it might be nice to catch up

185
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,710
该是多好的事啊
with my ninth favorite person.

186
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,440
第九号
Ninth?

187
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,880
你刚上升一名次哦
You moved up one.

188
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,680
我的索马里笔友被海盗绑架了
My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates.

189
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,670
你最近好吗
So, uh... how are you?

190
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,300
不太好
Uh... not so good.

191
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,630
我的心理医生自杀了
My shrink just killed himself and...

192
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,760
还留下纸条说都怪我
blamed me in the note.

193
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,640
好  很好
Great. Great.

194
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,680
那你家人怎么样
So, what's new with your family?

195
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,020
令堂好吗  还健在不
How's your mother? Is she alive?

196
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,180
在
Yeah.

197
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,680
那令尊呢  还健在不
And your father? Alive?

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,990
在
Yes.

199
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,230
那祖父母呢  他们还健在不
How about your grandparents, they alive?

200
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,680
不在了
No.

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,500
节哀顺变
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

202
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,780
说件开心的事吧
On a cheerier note,

203
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,950
我今天下午预约了去洁牙
I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon.

204
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,060
要不你送我过去吧  好伙计
What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?

205
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,870
不好意思  你要我送你去看牙医吗
I'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?

206
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,560
对  我现在承诺不了什么
Yes. Now, I can't make any promises,

207
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,720
但想挤进我第八位好友的候选名单
but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list

208
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,610
这种事绝对有加分哦
for the number eight friend slot.

209
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,810
谢尔顿  我在工作
Sheldon, I'm working.

210
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,520
我不能带你去看牙医
I can't take you to the dentist.

211
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,250
而且  我必须强调
Also-- and I can't stress this enough--

212
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,040
我不想带你去看牙医
I don't <i>want</i> to take you to the dentist.

213
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,820
在朋友有需要的时候也不帮一把  是吧
Can't help a friend out in a time of need, huh?

214
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,980
我明白你的心理医生为什么要自杀了
I see where your therapist was coming from.

215
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,010
想到了  我们把你的宇航员绰号定为
Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname

216
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,750
霍华德"巴斯"沃罗威茨怎么样
Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?
Buzz又译为仪器鸣叫声

217
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,750
不能用"巴斯"
You can't do "Buzz."

218
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,280
"巴斯"已经有人用了
"Buzz" is taken.

219
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,220
巴斯光年又不是真人
Buzz Lightyear is not real.

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,440
没错  但我不是这个意思
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,390
你是说他以为自己是真人的时候吗
Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?

222
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,350
不是
No.

223
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,670
好吧  那"坠"怎么样
Okay, um... how about "Crash"?

224
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,810
霍华德·坠·沃罗威茨
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

225
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,380
好极了  其他宇航员
Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts

226
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,350
肯定会爱死和一个名字
would love to go hurtling through space

227
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,080
带"坠"落的人
with a guy named "Crash."

228
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,750
好吧  让我想想
All right, um, how about...

229
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,060
火箭客怎么样
Oh, how about "Rocket Man"?

230
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,560
这个不赖  霍华德·"火箭客"·沃罗威茨
That's not bad, Howard "Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

231
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
是很不错  但我也说了
Yeah, it's great, but I told you,

232
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,530
绰号不是我选的
I don't get to pick my nickname.

233
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,420
是其他宇航员给你起的
It has to come from the other astronauts.

234
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,170
也许有办法让别人想到这个
Maybe there's a way to get them to come up with it.

235
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,590
比如呢
Like how?

236
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,850
我以前试过带着个邓肯溜溜球
Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo,

237
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,530
希望其他孩子会叫我邓肯
hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.

238
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,090
成功了吗
Did it work?

239
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,780
没有  他们最后叫我袜子嘴
No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth.

240
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,480
因为他们抢走了我的溜溜球
Because they took away my yo-yo

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,270
还把他们的袜子塞进我嘴里
and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

242
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,400
好吧  要是我们把"火箭客"做你手机铃声
Okay, uh, what if we make "Rocket Man" your ringtone,

243
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
下次你和那些宇航员说话的时候
and the next time you talk to those guys,

244
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,460
我就打电话给你  让他们听到
I'll call you and they'll hear it.

245
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,810
埋下心理暗示的种子
Plant the seed.

246
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,050
这个计划还真不赖
That's actually not a terrible plan.

247
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,520
哥的"劲爆巧克力"外号可不是白叫的
They don't call me "Brown Dynamite" for nothing.

248
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,070
哟
'Sup?

249
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,720
哟
'Sup?

250
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,940
你有没有去看牙医呀
Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?

251
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,240
没必要了
Not necessary. No.

252
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
我找到一项服务  他们会派辆车来你家
I found a service that'll send a van to your house

253
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,190
为你洗牙
for a teeth cleaning.

254
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,420
他们大多为狗服务  不过
Mostly they cater to dogs, but...

255
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,990
接电话的那个人还算思想开放
...the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.

256
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,010
好吧  谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon,

257
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,420
如果你要我开车送你去看牙医
if you need me to take you to the dentist,

258
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,310
我会送你去的
I will take you to the dentist.

259
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,890
这么说你是意识到了
Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses

260
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,580
并且想要重新接受室友协议
and wish to reestablish the mutual benefits that stem

261
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,940
恢复我们之间的互惠互助吗
from full participation in the Roommate Agreement?

262
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,910
当然了
Absolutely.

263
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,470
只要你承认你都三十岁了
If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man

264
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,440
还没法自己一个人独立生活
who's incapable of functioning on his own.

265
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,910
矮油  袜子嘴先生让他下不来台了
Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

266
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,050
我才不会承认这种事情
I will admit nothing of the sort.

267
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,540
现在我要失陪了
And now if you'll excuse me,

268
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,480
我要打电话给我牙医
I have to call my dentist and see

269
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,240
看他是不是也能帮我洗个头发剪个指甲
if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.

270
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,050
太好了  你这里也断电了
Oh, good, your power's out, too.

271
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,270
这算哪门子好
Why is that good?

272
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,590
因为上个月
Because last month,

273
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,980
我给电力公司寄了张星巴克礼品卡
I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card,

274
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,270
一封道歉信  和一些我穿着胸罩的照片
an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.

275
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,700
断电了
Power failure.

276
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,910
启动断电应急预案
Implementing power-failure protocol.

277
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
你不是在地板上画了夜光逃生路线么
What happened to all your glow- in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff

278
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
怎么没了
you had painted on the floor?

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,500
那玩意儿致癌
Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,110
不管怎样
Anyway...

281
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,660
你失去了我互助互惠的友谊
it's too bad you're no longer entitled

282
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,650
真是太不幸了
to the full benefits of my friendship,

283
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,160
因为我刚好为应付这种情况
because I happen to be extremely prepared

284
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
做了充分的准备
for such an emergency.

285
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,140
拜托你别借着这个灯光看东西
Please try not to see anything by this light.

286
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,250
这灯光不借外人用
It's not for you.

287
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,200
这只是断电  我肯定马上就恢复了
It's just a blackout; I'm sure the power will be back on soon.

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,420
唐纳组织里的某些白痴
And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party

289
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,540
唐纳组织:  美国早期拓荒者组织
拓荒旅途中因遭遇暴雪被困  发生了人吃人的惨剧
也说过雪马上就会停呢
said the snow would stop any day now.

290
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,520
我希望他们先吃了他
I like to think they ate him first.

291
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,280
我公寓里有些蜡烛
You know, I got some candles in my apartment.

292
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,000
蜡烛  现在可是在断电
But candles?! During a blackout?!

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
你疯了吗  那会有着火的危险
Are you mad? That's a fire hazard.

294
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,800
不  帕萨迪纳水电公司推荐使用
No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends

295
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,140
更安全的荧光棒
the far safer glow stick.

296
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,240
你那玩意也敢叫荧光棒
You call that a glow stick?

297
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,970
这才是荧光棒
That is a glow stick.

298
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,940
来吧  我们走
Come on, let's go.

299
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,880
等等  考虑下这个
Before you go, consider this.

300
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,420
我不但有深循环的海军陆战队电池
Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source

301
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,650
这能更好地支持
which is more than capable

302
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,990
我们的娱乐活动
of running our entertainment system,

303
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,220
我还有
I also have

304
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,730
一共61集的BBC科幻剧《红矮星号》
all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf...

305
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,810
还有《无聊星人》
and Fiddle-Faddle.

306
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,660
都是你的
All yours

307
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,410
只要你愿意恢复室友协议
if you're willing to reinstate the Roommate Agreement.

308
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,060
我家有酒  我们还可以摁泡泡塑料包装
I've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.

309
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,390
他会回来的
Oh, he'll be back.

310
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,980
和一个女孩在黑暗里喝酒
Wine and a girl in the dark--

311
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,830
他肯定会无聊死的
he's gonna be bored out of his mind.

312
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,110
敬美酒和泡泡包装
To wine and bubble wrap.

313
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,620
也敬不用看着谢尔顿演示
And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate

314
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,170
他怎么用反向渗透机
his reverse osmosis machine

315
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,950
把尿转换成饮用水
that converts urine into drinking water.

316
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,760
知道吗  在女孩子童子军里
You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dineesha said

317
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
苔米·戴妮莎说  你用丝袜就可以这么做
you could do that with panty hose.

318
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,820
天啊  那才叫错的离谱
Boy, was she wrong.

319
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,210
不说了  你想来亲热一下吗
Anyway, you want to make out?

320
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,610
我们的关系不是在测试中吗
I thought because our relationship's in a beta test,

321
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,650
我以为你想慢慢来
you wanted to take things slow.

322
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,560
好吧
Okay.

323
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,170
你想慢慢地来亲热吗
Do you want to make out slow?

324
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,700
我可以慢得像是蜗牛在你嘴里爬
I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.

325
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,740
算你走运  反正现在也没其他事好干
Well, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.

326
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,470
不好意思  莱纳德
Excuse me, Leonard.

327
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,020
你打什么时候开始不敲门的
Since when don't you knock?

328
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,930
这差不多是你唯一的优点了
It's like the only good thing about you.

329
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,150
这可不是讲究社交礼仪的时候  莱纳德
Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard.

330
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,890
现在可是紧急情况
We're in a state of emergency.

331
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,770
整个世界陷入黑暗动乱之中
The world has descended into darkened turmoil.

332
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,440
现在就必须目无法纪  野蛮行事
Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.

333
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,050
好吧  什么事
Fine, what is it?

334
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,690
我在做烤棉花糖
I'm making s'mores.

335
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,480
我是想来预先警告你
I wanted to alert you

336
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,620
以免你闻到烤棉花糖的教堂香味
in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows

337
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,330
会以为是附近的糖果厂着火了
and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.

338
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,350
烤棉花糖是吧  你厉害
S'mores, huh? Good for you.

339
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,100
要变成"我们"真厉害也行
Yes, or good for us

340
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,550
只要你在这签名
if you sign here

341
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,680
恢复我们原来的室友协议就行了
and reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.

342
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
不用了  谢谢  这样就行了
No, thanks. I'm good.

343
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,100
真的吗
Really?

344
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,790
好吧
Huh! Okay.

345
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,520
这样的话  我就自己独享烤棉花糖了
In that case, I will have a s'more by myself.

346
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,500
s'more烤棉花糖也是some more的缩写
然后我就会做出更多
And then I'm gonna have s'more.

347
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,050
独立完成
By myself.

348
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,750
别可怜他
No, don't "aw" him.

349
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,280
这一切都是他搞出来的
He brought this all on himself.

350
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,330
但他现在很可怜
But he's sad.

351
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,590
不  他在发疯
No, he's crazy.

352
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,120
有时候发疯看着很可怜
Sometimes crazy looks like sad

353
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,920
这样你才会重新上当
so it'll suck you back in.

354
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,930
他是在想念自己的小伙伴吧
I think he misses his little buddy.

355
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,580
好吧
Fine.

356
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,530
但记住我的话
But mark my words,

357
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,840
咱这场挫败的少年亲热大戏  可还没完
this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.

358
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,250
你不是说蜡烛很危险吗
I thought you said candles were dangerous.

359
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,140
煤气灯 德国化学家本生发明
这是本生灯
This is a Bunsen burner.

360
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,440
我是科学家  知道自己在做什么
I'm a scientist; I know what I'm doing.

361
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,890
该死
Oh, drat.

362
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,160
我用了一加仑尿液才制出那杯水的
It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.

363
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,820
谢尔顿  咱别做傻事了
Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid.

364
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,630
我们怎么就不能做朋友了
I don't see why we can't be friends.

365
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,090
我是很乐意载你出去
And I'm willing to drive you around

366
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,300
帮你办各种事务的
and help you out with stuff.

367
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,240
我只是不愿意
I just don't want to do it

368
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,350
为了什么傻帽室友协议才这样做
because of some silly Roommate Agreement.

369
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,890
你有何提议
What are you proposing?

370
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,030
我提议咱回到从前那样
That we go back to the way things were.

371
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,870
但在我为你做点事之后
But when I do something for you,

372
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,830
你应该表达出一点感激之情
you show a little appreciation.

373
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,850
你想让我怎么表达
And how would I do that?

374
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,040
你跟我说"谢谢你"
You say "thank you."

375
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,710
每次都要说吗
Every time?

376
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,780
这样不算疯狂
It's not crazy.

377
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,010
我有反对意见
Counter-proposal.

378
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,370
我们恢复之前所有室友协议
We reinstate the full Roommate Agreement

379
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,930
并添加如下附录
with the following addendum:

380
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,650
本着母亲节或父亲节精神
in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day,

381
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,790
每年  我们特别留出一天
once a year, we set aside a day

382
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,010
以赞美你对我生活的所有贡献
to celebrate all your contributions to my life,

383
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,120
不管是你真正的贡献还是想象中的贡献
both actual and imagined by you.

384
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,810
我们可以叫它"莱纳德节"
We could call it Leonard's Day.

385
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,110
这叫法  我喜欢
I kind of like the sound of that.

386
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,420
你当然喜欢
Of course you do.

387
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,630
这可是你的节  就像其他节一样
It's about you, like everything else.

388
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,960
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

389
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,740
我膀胱里的尿不够再做一杯水了
I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.

390
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,610
-那莱纳德节那天你会把早餐端我床上吗  -不
- So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day? - No.

391
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,680
-那天能坐你的位置吗  -不行
- Can I sit in your spot? - No.

392
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,220
-能让我调节下恒温器吗  -不能
Can I control the thermostat? No.

393
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,110
能送我张贺卡吗
Do I get a card?

394
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,940
当然
Of course you get a card.

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
那可是莱纳德节啊
It's Leonard's Day.

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,580
两位  物业经理说
Hey, guys, the building manager said

397
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,840
整幢楼停电的原因是
the reason the power went out is

398
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,030
有人偷偷下去到地下室
someone went down into the basement

399
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,130
把电源总开关给关了
and just pulled the main breaker switch.

400
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,440
真的吗
Really.

401
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,240
你觉得这会是谁做的呀  谢尔顿
Who do you think did that, Sheldon?

402
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,780
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

403
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,460
但不管这神秘人是谁
But whoever that mystery man was,

404
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,080
你都该永远感谢他
you should be eternally grateful,

405
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,650
因为没有他  就不会有莱纳德节
for without him, there would be no Leonard's Day.

406
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,700
莱纳德节
Leonard's Day?

407
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,040
不必有压力

There's a reason he's <i>Sir</i> Elton John.

413
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,270

414
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,580
