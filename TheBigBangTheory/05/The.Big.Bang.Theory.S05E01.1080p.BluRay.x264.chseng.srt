00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,170
《生活大爆炸》前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,910
我哥哥  深深地暗恋着伯纳黛特
My brother-- he's got a big crush on Bernadette.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,620
你要回印度吗
You're moving back to India?

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,600
这是怎么回事
What's going on?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,660
反正不是你们看上去的那样
It's-It's not what it looks like.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,220
那到底看上去像怎么样
What does it look like?

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,080
"不是你们看上去的那样"
It's not what it looks like.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,840
"不是你们看上去的那样"
It's not what it looks like.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,530
你在碎碎念什么啊
What are you grinding about?

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,700
佩妮今早留下的头脑风暴悬念
Penny's brain teaser this morning.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,380
她跟库萨帕里
She and Koothrappali

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,240
从你的卧室走出
emerge from your bedroom.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,980
她衣衫不整  拉杰只裹了个床单
She is disheveled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,560
唯一的线索只有"不是你们看上去的那样"
The sole clue: "It's not what it looks like."

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,100
别纠结了  谢尔顿
Just let it go, Sheldon.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,420
纠结不是我想停  想停就能停的
If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,710
目前的信息表明佩妮
Now, knowing Penny,

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,030
最明显的答案当然是两人交媾了
the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,320
但是...
But...

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,450
鉴于那是"看上去的那样"
Since that's what it looked like,

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,160
我们可以排除这个可能性
we can rule that out.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,960
让我们戴上智能帽子考虑一下吧  如何
Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?
智能帽子:澳大利亚思维中心研制的让人更聪明的帽子

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,740
拉杰来自印度  一个热带国家
Raj is from India, a tropical country.

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,210
第三世界的卫生条件
Third World hygiene.

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,780
寄生病感染司空见惯  例如蛲虫病
Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,180
诊断蛲虫病的步骤  就是等待
The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,820
直到宿主陷入沉睡状态
until the subject is asleep,

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,110
然后蛲虫从宿主的直肠爬出来透气
and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,140
没错  正像你刚才那样
Yes, just like that.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,970
佩妮可能在观测寄生虫从拉杰的菊花爬出来呢
Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites.

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,320
天呐
Oh, boy.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,210
真是位称职的蓝颜知己啊
That's a true blue friend.

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,340
他们上床了  大神探
They slept together, Sherlock.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,990
不  你没认真听
No, you weren't listening.

35
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,750
她说了  "不是你们看上去的那样"
She said it's not what it looks like.

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,340
她说谎了
She lied.

37
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,330
呃
Oh.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,260
那我坐在这还戴着这东西岂不是弱爆了
Don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,780
生活大爆炸第五季第一集

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,060
莱纳德  现在对你而言
Leonard, is it awkward for you

41
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,100
看到你的挚友跟你曾经爱过的女人
knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,740
就在你每天睡觉的地方交媾
with a woman you used to love

43
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,120
是否觉得很尴尬
in the very place you lay your head?

44
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,560
不  我能接受
No, I'm fine with it.

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,710
那听起来像讽刺啊
That sounds like sarcasm,

46
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,820
但是我决定无视它
but I'm going to disregard it,

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,830
因为我还有其他安排: 玩彩弹枪
because I have an agenda-- paintball.

48
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,330
本周来点特别的  搞个不同部门间的比赛
Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend.

49
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,520
为了变为更有效率的作战小队
In order to function better as a fighting unit,

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,140
我认为我们有必要建立一个领导机制
I thought we should establish a chain of command.

51
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,500
当然自不待言
Now, it goes without saying

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,380
我的地位理应高于你们三位
that I would outrank the three of you,

53
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,730
但问题在于  高多少呢
but the question remains, by how much?

54
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,650
我认为我不该充当那种在指挥部桌前发号施令
Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk

55
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,420
只会跟国防部打高尔夫的四星上将的角色
and playing golf with the Secretary of Defense.

56
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,480
但我也不能当库珀中士
But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper,

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,390
这可能会误导你们
because that might lead you

58
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,120
把我仅仅看成个小人物
to think of me as just a regular Joe.

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,620
这事儿可能需要动点脑筋  交给你们了
This might take some thought. As you were.

60
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,030
你到底有什么毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with you?

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,330
是啊  你怎么能这么做呢
Yeah, how could you do that?

62
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,240
-跟你有何关联  -我挺他啊
- What is it to you? - I got his back.

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,200
是啊  你嫉妒我因为事实证明
Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,900
我才是佩妮仅次于莱纳德的第二选择
I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.

65
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,010
拜托  如果我没跟伯纳黛特订婚
Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,

66
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,990
二号选择完全可能是我
that totally could have been me.

67
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,570
拜托  谢尔顿都有可能在你之前
Please. Sheldon would have been before you,

68
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,060
他说不定连生殖器都没有呢
and he might not even have genitals!

69
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,030
你为何这么在意啊
Why do you care so much?

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,250
你还跟我妹妹约会呢
You're dating my sister,

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,290
况且佩妮和我还相恋了
and Penny and I are in love.

72
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,510
什么
What?!

73
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,880
先生们  容我插一句
Gentlemen, if I may interject,

74
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,480
我决定我的军阶为上尉了
I've decided my rank will be captain.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,760
如果科克船长  嘎嘣脆船长和袋鼠船长都能胜任此职
If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo,
嘎嘣脆船长:麦片品牌  袋鼠船长:美国某儿童节目主持人的称呼

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,150
那对我而言也不错
it's good enough for me.

77
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,120
你没有跟佩妮相恋
You're not in love with Penny.

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,270
有  我有
Yes, I am.

79
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,800
伟大的天神迦摩天用他的爱之花箭射中了我们
The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,610
谁
Who?

81
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,180
他是印度的丘比特
He's the Hindu version of Cupid,

82
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,020
但他帅多了  因为他骑着一只硕大的鹦鹉
but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.

83
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,410
拜托拉杰  哪个女孩子对你笑  你就会爱上谁
Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you.

84
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,800
一个月前  你还给他未婚妻写情诗呢
A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiance.

85
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,920
什么  他啥意思
I'm sorry. What?!

86
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,730
胡说  他胡说八道
Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

87
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,020
哦  伯纳黛特  请给我吹箫吧
"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,000
那也可以是别人嘛
That could have been about anyone.

89
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,220
况且  你没必要担心
Besides, you have nothing to worry about,

90
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,010
我现在是库佩恋的主角之一
because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.

91
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,480
说明一下  我有生殖器
For the record, I do have genitals.

92
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,950
不但功能强劲  而且外形健美
They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.

93
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,630
来了
Oh. Coming.

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,730
说到底
Yup, that's good.

95
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,030
还是一醉解千愁
Wine glasses should have handles.

96
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,930
准确记录你的酒精摄入量
Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake.

97
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,940
鉴于你的酒后乱性程度
Smart idea considering how trampy you get

98
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,450
这么做很聪明
when you've had a few.

99
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,720
你听说我干的事了
You heard what I did?

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
我听说你干了谁了
Well, I heard who you did.

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,180
老天呐
Oh, my God,

102
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,420
我全搞砸了
I screwed up everything.

103
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,410
我伤害了莱纳德
I hurt Leonard.

104
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,620
我伤害了拉杰
I hurt Raj.

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,610
我真是有毛病啊我
I mean, what is wrong with me?

106
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,800
我感觉自己完全是两个不同的人
I feel like two totally different people--

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,620
原电影名为Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
化娼博士
Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

108
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,340
别太自责了
Don't be so hard on yourself.

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,130
你知道凯萨琳大帝的故事吗
Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?

110
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,350
不知道
No.

111
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,310
她是俄罗斯
She ruled Russia

112
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,910
18世纪后期的统治者
in the late 1700s, and one night,

113
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,630
一天晚上  她感觉性欲特别强
when she was feeling particularly randy,

114
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,610
她用一个复杂的滑轮系统
she used an intricate system of pulleys

115
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,450
跟一匹马发生了亲密关系
to have intimate relations with a horse.

116
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,610
不好意思
I'm... I'm sorry.

117
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,680
这跟我有什么关系
What does this have to do with me?

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,970
她跟不同物种发生过关系
She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky,

119
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,510
但人们依然尊称她"大帝"啊
and people still call her "Great."

120
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,000
我相信你的名誉不会因为
I'm sure your reputation can survive

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
一个小印度男而毁掉的
you shagging a little Indian boy.

122
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,090
你个不要脸的东西
You jerk face!

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,310
你跟霍华德说什么了
What did you tell Howard?!

124
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,340
你跟他说我们之间有奸情是不是
Did you say there was something going on between us?

125
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,490
他现在就是这么想的
Because he thinks there is!

126
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,730
他整个人都抓狂了
He's completely freaking out!

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,210
请进
Please, come in.

128
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,150
你这人有毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with you?! Well...

129
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,140
你总是对我这么好  我以为你喜欢我嘛
You were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.

130
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,430
我对谁都这么好啊
I'm nice to everyone!

131
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,990
对不起
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,140
没错  你是对不起我
Damn right, you're sorry!

133
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,500
你去跟霍华德说我们之间 没有任何暧昧之情
And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us!

134
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,910
-我会的  伯纳黛特  -干嘛
- I will. Hey, Bernadette?  - What?!

135
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,510
你觉得我和佩妮有机会吗
Do you think I have a shot with Penny?

136
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,640
当然啦  你那么可爱
Of course you do. You're a cutie pie!

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,710
哪个女孩子遇到你真是三生有幸啦
Any girl would be lucky to have you!

138
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,470
你知道吗  我以前就犯过这种错
You know, I've done this before.

139
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,340
在幼儿园的时候
In kindergarten,

140
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,570
我本来要在下课期间嫁给杰森·索伦森
I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess,

141
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,080
但等同学们都出来的时候
but by the time my class got out there,

142
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,100
他已经和切尔西·辛莫法订婚了
he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

143
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
知道我怎么做吗
So what did I do?

144
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,260
我倒吊在猴架上
Hung upside down from the monkey bars,

145
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,010
让全部男生看我的内裤
let all the boys see my underpants.

146
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,510
你不能责怪自己
You can't blame yourself.

147
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,830
当你的前额皮质无法使你开心时
When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy,

148
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,040
滥交能给你带来大量所需的多巴胺
promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine.

149
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,830
我们神经生物学家称之为"下流反射"
We neurobiologists refer to this as the "Skank reflex."

150
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,100
这样吧
You know what?

151
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,210
我们出去玩
Let's get out of here.

152
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,170
我们去哪玩
Where are we going?

153
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,170
去没有人看过我裸体的地方
Somewhere where no one's seen me naked.

154
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,710
可能得开一会车才行
We may have to drive awhile.

155
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,840
聪敏就不是她的强项  对吧
Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?

156
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,980
我能去你家睡几晚吗
Can I stay at your place for a few nights?

157
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,260
真的吗
Really?

158
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,090
闺蜜来过夜  好嘢
A best friend sleepover? Yay.

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,360
当然  好嘢
Yeah, sure. Yay!

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,150
我们弄点爆米花  玩他个通宵
We'll make popcorn, stay up all night

161
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,090
我会教你说我的密语  表嗷话
and I'll teach you my secret language, Op.

162
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,390
-听上去不错  -错
- Sounds great.  - Nope.

163
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,740
应该是听上去"表嗷错噢"
Sounds "Gop Rop E A Top."

164
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,010
-好吧  我去收个包  -不  错了
- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.  - No, you're not.

165
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,040
你是去"收个表嗷噢"
You're gonna "Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."

166
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,010
我们真要穿这蠢爆了的迷彩服
Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap

167
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,700
去打彩弹吗
to play paintball?

168
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,310
谁在说话
Who said that?

169
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,920
莱纳德  我能听到你
Leonard, I can hear your voice,

170
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
但看不到你
but I can't see you.

171
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,970
我没那心情  谢尔顿
I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

172
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,210
哎呀  你在这啊
Oh, there you are!

173
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,930
莱纳德
Leonard,

174
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,070
我知道你为最近的事不开心
I know you're upset about recent events, and

175
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,800
所以我找了人来帮你
I have someone here to help.

176
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,980
我不想和艾米说话
I don't want to talk to Amy.

177
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,240
不  那不是艾米
No, it's not Amy.

178
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,220
你好  宝贝儿
Hello, dear.

179
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,380
你叫了我妈
You called my mother?

180
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,440
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard,

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,250
非要说得这么明显吗
is it really necessary to caption the obvious?

182
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,840
他还是小孩时就这样了
He's been like that since he was a toddler.

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,950
看呀  妈咪  一只蝴蝶
"Look, Mommy-- a butterfly."

184
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,850
真闹心
Maddening.

185
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,900
怎么了  你有什么事
What's going on? What do you want?

186
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,080
谢尔顿告诉我说
Sheldon informed me

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,510
你正在遭遇感情上的剧变
that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval,

188
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,250
所以我来帮忙
and I'm here to help.

189
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,420
你真贴心
That's so nice.

190
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,240
这不又是明摆着的么
And we're back to the obvious.

191
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,960
好吧  怎么了
Now, what's up?

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,470
那个  嗯
Well, uh... okay.

193
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,870
我不想和佩妮复合
I don't want to get back together with Penny.

194
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,060
我们尝试过  很疯狂  效果很糟糕
We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work,

195
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,280
但我也不能接受
but I can't deal with the fact

196
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,780
她和我朋友拉杰上床了
that she slept with my friend Raj.

197
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,570
我还发现拉杰的妹妹普莉娅
And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya,

198
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,300
我和她交往了八个月
who I've been going out with for eight months,

199
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,800
而她现在要回印度
is moving back to India.

200
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,070
所以我完全迷茫和寂寞了
So I'm just completely confused and alone.

201
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,800
我理解
I understand.

202
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,030
有什么建议吗
Got any advice?

203
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,220
有  振作起来
Yes. Buck up.

204
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,450
啥
Excuse me.

205
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,060
你一个世界知名的
You're a world-renowned expert

206
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,730
育儿和儿童成长专家
in parenting and child development,

207
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,910
能给的建议就是"振作起来"吗
and all you've got is "Buck up"?

208
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,510
不好意思
Sorry.

209
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,950
振作起来  小娘炮
Buck up, sissy pants.

210
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,260
多谢  妈妈  我感觉好多了
Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.

211
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,770
你要是有什么要我帮忙
If you need any more help from me,

212
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,200
就去亚马逊上买我的书
my books are available on Amazon.

213
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,160
下了
Logging off.

214
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,610
九十九  一百
...ninety-nine, one hundred.

215
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,000
秀发如金色瀑布一般倾泻而下
It's like a waterfall of liquid gold.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
轮到我了
My turn.

217
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,330
我都不知道我干嘛
You know, I don't even know what the point

218
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,610
要住在洛杉矶
of me staying in L.A. Is.

219
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,880
我搬到这后连一次演员工作机会都没有
I haven't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here.

220
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,050
最接近的就是上个月
The closest I came was last month,

221
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,110
一个做痔疮广告的打了电话给我
I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.

222
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,410
我觉得你那张脸演得了痔疮的会很传神
Oh, I could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids.

223
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,100
你也觉得吧
I know, right?

224
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,500
我是不是干脆搬回内布拉斯加得了
Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,590
不  你不能这么做
No, I can't let you do that.

226
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,730
为什么
Why not?

227
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
有史以来第一次
For the first time ever,

228
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
我的社交生活蒸蒸日上
I have a thriving social life.

229
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,110
不是给你压力
And no pressure,

230
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,650
但你要是走了  这一切都完了
but it kind of lives and dies with you.

231
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,290
你好  艾米
Hi, Amy.

232
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,750
我能和佩妮谈谈吗
Can I talk to Penny?

233
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,230
我的滚轮床有人来睡  还有男生来我家
A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door?

234
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,720
我真想穿越回去告诉十三岁的我  "真的会好起来的"
I wish I could tell 13-year-old me "It does get better."

235
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,720
你怎么知道我在这里
How did you know I was here?

236
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,920
她的Facebook上都写了
It's all over her Facebook page.

237
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,860
我把你的东西搬去卧室
I'll take your stuff to the bedroom

238
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,590
-再把抽屉整理一下  -谢了
- and clear out a drawer. - Thanks.

239
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,520
没事  这次管好你的裤子  好吗
No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?

240
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,030
你好
So, hi.

241
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,330
有事吗
What's up?

242
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,980
不知道你周五有没有空
I was wondering if you're free Friday.

243
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,000
周五在格里克有个八十年代之夜
They're having a Totally '80s Night at the Greek.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,560
有霍尔与奥兹二重唱  卡特琳娜
Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves

245
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,180
均是八十年代的音乐人和组合
还有卡加勾勾组合里的三个人
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

246
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,930
这真的很不错  但问题是...
Gee, that's really sweet, but the thing is...

247
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,980
有问题了
Aw, there's a thing.

248
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,970
听着  亲爱的  我当时醉得很厉害
Look, honey, I was really drunk

249
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,600
昨晚犯了个严重的错误
and made a huge mistake last night.

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,370
我们绝不该发生这种关系
We should've never slept together.

251
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,470
这会毁了我们的友谊的
It's what ruins friendships.

252
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,380
做爱是毁不了友谊的
You can't ruin a friendship with sex.

253
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,910
就好像巧克力屑不会毁了冰淇淋一样
That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.

254
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,750
来坐下来
Come here.

255
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,180
听我说
Just listen to me.

256
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,420
我想时光倒流  回到我们从前那样
I want to go back to the way we were before.

257
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,700
当朋友
You know, friends.

258
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
不放巧克力屑
No sprinkles.

259
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,420
好吧
All right.

260
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,090
谢谢你
Thank you.

261
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:07,580
作为朋友  我要告诉你
As your friend, you might like to know that, um...

262
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,450
传统意义上来说  我们没有做爱
we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.

263
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,290
天哪
Oh, God.

264
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,350
你对我做了什么怪异的印度花样吗
Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?

265
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,950
不  不是的
No, no.

266
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,010
我们脱光衣服上床之后
After we got undressed and jumped in bed,

267
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
你问了我有没有带安全套
you-you asked if I had protection.

268
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,860
哦  你一定带了  是吧
Oh, you did, didn't you?

269
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,870
当然  我一向随身带着的
Of course. I'm always packing.

270
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,160
总之
Anyway,

271
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,190
当时我有点戴不上套子
um, I had trouble putting it on

272
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,630
你就想来帮我
and you tried to help and...

273
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,760
然后就没有然后了
that was all she wrote.

274
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,280
所以  我们其实没有...
So, we didn't actually...

275
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,050
我射了
I did.

276
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,080
感觉很美妙
It was beautiful.

277
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,730
佩妮  求求你答应我
Penny, please, please promise me

278
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,790
不会告诉任何人
you won't tell anybody about this.

279
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,610
当然  一定不说
Of course I won't. No, I won't.

280
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,360
太好了
Oh, good.

281
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,860
我可不可以告诉别人
Um, can I tell people that our love

282
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,450
我们的爱燃烧太快  转瞬即逝
burned too bright and too quickly?

283
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,030
就像"风中之烛"那样
Kind of a "Candle in the Wind" deal?

284
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,070
当然可以
Sure.

285
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,210
酷  我可以说我们分手
Cool. Can I say it fell apart

286
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,080
是因为你一直嚷嚷着想要我孩子
because you were all "I want to have your babies""

287
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,270
而我觉得自己还要继续流浪不能安定下来吗
and I was like "I'm too rock and roll to be tied down"?

288
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,890
不行
No.

289
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,490
我可以说因为你是白种人  所以我甩了你吗
Can I say I ruined you for white men?

290
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,610
还是不行
Also no.

291
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,330
-好吧  就说风中烛那个吧  -对
- Okay, just the candle thing. - Yeah.

292
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,510
酷
Cool.

293
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,860
好吧  朋友
All right... friend.

294
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,180
回见
I'll see you around.

295
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,760
好的
Okay.

296
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,650
拉杰  等等
Raj, wait.

297
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,870
谢谢你当我朋友
Thank you for being my friend.

298
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,130
佩妮
Penny?

299
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,610
我又开始觉得美妙了
It's getting beautiful again.

300
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,150
好了  这是本战场的"谷歌地球"画面
All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.

301
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
我什么都没看见
I don't see anything.

302
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,240
等一会  在载入
Give it a second to load.

303
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,550
可以了吧  AT&T[美国电话电报公司]
Whenever you're ready, AT&T!

304
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,260
好了  来吧
Okay, here we go.

305
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
我们在这
This is us here.

306
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,490
南面是卢米斯教授和地质系诸人
To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department.

307
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,440
据其twitter记录  他们没防晒霜了
According to their twitter feed, they're out of sunblock,

308
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,390
就是说他们要不躲在林木线下
which means they'll have to hug the tree line

309
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,560
不然就有得黑色素瘤危险
or risk melanoma.

310
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,770
这就是我们的优势
That's our edge.

311
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,700
我们只需要快速穿过这个山脊
All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge,

312
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,610
就能把这帮崇拜石头  苍白脸色的混蛋
the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards

313
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,540
出其不意地击倒
won't know what hit them!

314
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,260
好了  出发吧
All right, let's move out.

315
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,350
等等  谢尔顿
Hang on, Sheldon.

316
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,930
你怎么能不告诉我  你妹妹要回印度
How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?

317
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,760
也许他当时正忙着
Maybe he was too busy

318
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,810
写关于我未婚妻的拙劣阴茎隐喻
writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiance.

319
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,600
滚你的
Screw you.

320
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,260
那明明是绝妙的阴茎隐喻
That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.

321
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,030
各位  我实在没心情打彩弹球
You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball.

322
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,700
不如我们直接当逃兵吧
What do you say we just bag it?

323
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,270
-我同意  -好吧  随便
- Fine with me. - Sure, whatever.

324
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,790
不能当逃兵
You can't quit.

325
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,320
这样是要交军事法庭审判的罪行
That's a court-martial offense.

326
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,890
可被判处...
That's punishable by...

327
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,530
反正不行
You can't quit.

328
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,560
抱歉谢尔顿
Sorry, Sheldon,

329
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,140
现在玩彩弹球游戏实在不是时候
it's just not a good time for playing games.

330
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,000
你以为这是游戏吗
This is a game to you?

331
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,250
安提耶坦之战也是游戏吗
Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game?
美国南北战争时期的著名战役

332
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,000
罗马被洗劫也是游戏吗
Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
历史上  罗马曾遭多次洗劫

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,370
是  不是  不是
Yes, no and no.

334
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,630
慢着
Wait.

335
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,770
我只是想你们知道  我原谅你们了
I just want you all to know that I forgive you.

336
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,110
这次叛变不是你们的错
This mutiny isn't your fault,

337
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,670
是我的问题
it's mine.

338
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,210
我配不上这些两道杠[军衔]
I haven't earned these bars.

339
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,370
显然我的领导才能的不足
Although what I lack in leadership,

340
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,920
全弥补在缝纫技术上了
apparently I more than make up for in sewing.

341
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,640
算了吧  谢尔顿
Let it go, Sheldon.

342
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,340
原名坚宝果汁
回家的路上我会给你买杯丈八果汁的
I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.

343
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,730
不要
No.

344
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,430
丈八果汁是给英雄喝的
Jamba Juice is for heroes.

345
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,350
所以我们要当英雄
And that's what we're going to be.

346
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,010
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

347
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,310
步柯克船长和嘎嘣脆船长  以及袋鼠船长的后尘
Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

348
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,790
地质学不是真正的科学
Geology isn't a real science!

349
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,770
那帮混球太过分了
Damn those sons of bitches!

350
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,260
干掉他们
Let's get 'em!

351
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,150
尝尝老子的厉害
Eat paint!

352
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,040
如果将来有谢尔顿党的话
If there's ever a Church of Sheldon,

353
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,260
那应该就是从此时开始的
this will be when it started.

354
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,550
哎呦喂
Ow!

355
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,400
让我们为英雄举杯
I'd like to propose a toast

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,100
正是他悲壮的牺牲  我们才能赢得胜利
to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory,

357
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,860
感谢谢尔顿·库珀上尉
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,800
-说得好  -说得妙
- Hear, hear. - Hear, hear.

359
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,060
抱歉  应该是谢尔顿·库珀少校
Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper.

360
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,010
为了犒赏在沙场上的英勇
With my last breath,

361
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,210
我用仅存的一口气  给自己升了一级官
I awarded myself a battlefield promotion.

362
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,360
这也算小有成就吧
It's kind of a big deal.

363
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,800
嗨  你们有时间吗
Hi. You guys have a minute?

364
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,910
当然有
Uh, yeah, sure.

365
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,970
好的
Okay.

366
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,790
我已经跟拉杰谈过了
Well, I already talked to Raj,

367
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,150
但是我想向你们其他几个道歉
but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for,

368
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,830
为之前的一切  道个歉
you know, everything.

369
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,040
拜托  佩妮  让我来说吧
Please, Penny, let me.

370
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,960
我们决定让那晚既疯狂又美好的春宵
We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together

371
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,140
成为大家心里的美好回忆
be just one of those memories you have

372
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,320
当你们心情低落或洗澡时
and can call to mind when you're feeling blue

373
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,840
可以拿出来回味一下
or you're in the shower.

374
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,220
你这是干什么  三分钟先生[早泄王?]
Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?

375
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,870
抱歉  您请说
Sorry. Go on.

376
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,040
总之  我来是想告诉大家
Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know

377
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,650
我很认真地审视了一遍自己
that I've been taking a really hard look at things

378
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,250
于是得出一个结论
and come to the conclusion

379
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,350
我不能再自欺欺人了
I have to stop kidding myself.

380
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,540
我根本不会演戏
I suck at acting.

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,590
是时候卷铺盖回家了
It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.

382
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,010
你要走吗
You're leaving?

383
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,190
对
Yeah.

384
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,330
你准备回内布拉斯加做什么
What are you going to do in Nebraska?

385
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,930
不知道  或许教表演吧
I don't know, maybe teach acting.

386
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,300
抱歉  稍等
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

387
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,180
你好
Hello?

388
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,740
佩妮  听着  我不希望你是因为我才走的
Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me,

389
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,750
因为我有女友相伴  而你只能孤芳自赏
because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman...

390
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,350
别吵  我经纪人打来的
Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent.

391
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,200
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

392
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,070
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

393
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,700
我简直不敢相信  真的吗
I can't believe it! Really?!

394
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,070
我太激动了
Oh, I'm so excited!

395
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,950
谢谢
Thank you!

396
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,160
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

397
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,910
好  再见
Okay, bye.

398
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,030
我接了个痔疮广告
I got the hemorrhoid commercial!

399
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,950
周一开拍
I start Monday!

400
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,580
那内布拉斯加呢
What about Nebraska?

401
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,690
鬼才回内布拉斯加
Oh, hell with Nebraska.

402
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,270
姐要当明星啦
I'm gonna be a star!

403
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,950
你有考虑过教物理吗
Have you ever thought of teaching physics?

404
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,830
准备要上马了吗
Ready to ride?

405
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,660
恐怕不行  妈
I don't think so, Mom.

406
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,230
今天不行
Not today.

407
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,750
小宝贝
Oh, sweetie.

408
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,890
痔疮又犯了吧
Hemorrhoids acting up again?

409
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,020
你不会明白我的痛
You don't know the half of it.

410
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,750
不  我懂
Oh, yes, I do.

411
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,700
只需轻抹痛处一点点
Try a dab of this.

412
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,810
"女性专用玫瑰香型白宫痔疮膏"
"Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?"

413
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,290
