1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,700
通往地下城的入口是一道布满苔藓的大门
"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,170
你设法打开门  结果发现自己
"You manage to open it only to find yourself

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,900
面对着一个丑陋恶臭
"Face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,080
布满苔藓的食人魔
moss-covered ogre."

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
你该怎么做
What do you do?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,230
我会跟他说"老妈  今晚吃点啥呢"
I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,970
十七点
Seventeen.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,380
食人魔被你的玩笑打动  允许你进入了
The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,690
顺便说一句  我也喜欢
By the by, I liked it, too.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,640
婚礼筹备得如何了  霍华德
How go the wedding plans, Howard?

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,260
很好啊  我们昨晚花了五小时
Great. We spent five hours last night

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,490
在梅西百货挑选礼物
at Macy's registering for gifts.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,440
看上去我终于能够品尝到
Looks like I'm finally going to have

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,080
我那梦寐以求的小巧可爱的陶盘芦笋菜肴了
that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I've always wanted.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,240
看吧  这就是
See, this is the good thing

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,660
女友远在天边的好处了
about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,370
我起码可以在晚上为所欲为
I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,080
你指的是跟我们玩完书呆子游戏后
You mean like playing nerd games with us

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,880
再去冲个可疑的长时间热水澡吗
and then taking a suspiciously long shower?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,580
也许吧
Maybe.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,620
我们进入了地下城
We enter the dungeon.

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,580
看见了一条龙
You see a dragon.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,720
不是吧  我们玩的这叫《龙与地下城》
Really? So we're playing Dungeons & Dragons

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
然后进入地下城就看见一条龙
and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon?

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,740
不觉得有点太直接了吗
Isn't that a little on the nose?

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,100
当你玩梯子滑道游戏时  你抱怨过
When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,670
所有的滑道和梯子吗
about all the chutes and all the ladders?

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,990
你要把整个馅饼都吃了吗
Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,510
也许吧  为啥不行
Maybe. Why not?

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,040
我的人生又有谁值得去为之奋斗呢
Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,790
天哪  你是不是又看了一遍《BJ单身日记》
Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
不是啊  因为大家都有了归属
No, it's just that everybody's got someone.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
谢尔顿和艾米在一起  霍华德要结婚了
Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,050
你在跟我妹妹约会
you're dating my sister.

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,480
既然霍华德要结婚了
Now that Howard's getting married,

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,580
他可能会在众多充气娃娃中  挑一个前女友送你
maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.

37
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,390
你知道我的孤独是谁的错吗
You know who I blame for my loneliness?

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,390
就是美利坚合众国
The United States of America.

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,950
你们的电影和电视剧承诺这里的街道
Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,600
满是漂亮的金发巨乳美女
with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,140
再吃个馅饼  你就能拥有自己的巨乳了
Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas.

42
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,960
你这么说太残忍了
That's cruel.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,140
你知道我的肥肉只会长在屁股上
You know it goes straight to my hips.

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,280
先生们  请专心点
Gentlemen, please focus.

45
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,030
你们现在面对着一条喷火龙
You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,330
我不想玩下去了
I don't know if I want to play anymore.

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,930
就因为你没有女朋友吗
Because you don't have a girlfriend?

48
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,860
我的亲娘七舅老爷
Well, good Lord,

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,830
如果因为这就不玩《龙与地下城》
if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons & Dragons,

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,810
那这游戏算走到头了
this game's in serious trouble.

51
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,650
生活大爆炸第五季第四集

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,030
等会儿我们还用这些蜡剂
Now, I assume we use this same wax later on

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,730
来互相清理我们的比基尼部位
to neaten up each other's bikini regions.
比基尼部位:女性的三个隐私部位

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,140
我的比基尼部位很干净
Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,370
谁震惊到了  我没有
Who's shocked? I'm not.

56
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,710
伯纳黛特  婚礼筹划得怎样了
So, Bernadette, how's the wedding planning going?

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,020
我这么问可不是想成为伴娘候选人哦
And I'm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,420
快选我吧  选我吧
Pick me! Pick me!

59
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,230
我们昨天去试吃婚宴蛋糕了
We went cake-tasting yesterday.

60
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,030
拉杰也来了
Raj came along.

61
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,500
他痛哭流涕  还吃掉一半的蛋糕样品
He cried and ate half the samples.

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,590
那可怜的家伙太孤独了
Oh, the poor guy's so lonely.

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,850
我们应该给他找个伴儿
We should set him up with someone.

64
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,440
我工作时遇到了个可爱的女孩儿
You know, I met a really cute girl at work.

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,810
她嫁给了我们那儿一位药品临床试验者
She's married to a guy in one of our drug trials.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,230
喂
Well, hello?

67
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,000
她都已婚了啊
She's married.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
是啊  但她老公目前
Yeah, but her husband is in

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,130
处于充血性心脏衰竭状态
serious congestive heart failure,

70
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,280
据称  他现在已经被安排到安慰剂组了
and a little birdie told me he's in the placebo group.
安慰剂：并不能使病人得到有效治疗，但却"预料"或"相信"治疗有效，而让病患症状得到舒缓

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,540
好吧  未来又多一位悲伤的寡妇
Okay, so future grief-stricken widow

72
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,200
亟待他人的抚慰了
is the one to beat.

73
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,160
我们准备点菜了吗
Are we ready to order?

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,550
稍等
One moment.

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,960
我现在正在做一个实验
I'm conducting an experiment.

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,370
用《龙与地下城》的骰子吗
With Dungeons & Dragons dice?

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,700
是的  从这刻起  我决定
Yes. From here on in, I've decided

78
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,710
以后不重要的决定都通过掷骰子决定
to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice,

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,990
这样可以为我的头脑腾出时间
thus freeing up my mind

80
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,960
做它最擅长的事儿:启迪思维  震惊世界
do what it does best-- enlighten and amaze.

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,770
第14页  第7条
Page 14, item seven.

82
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,440
那么我们到底吃什么
So, what's for dinner?

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,960
一份豆煮玉米
A side of corn succotash.

84
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,830
真有意思
Hmm. Interesting.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,280
霍华德  我能找你有点事儿吗
Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,780
我不想再给你的朋友们表演
I don't want to show any more of your friends

87
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,470
我是如何坐进幼儿加高座椅里了
how I can fit in the booster seats.

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,880
额  不是让你做这个  请跟我来吧
Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.

89
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,550
我们看看喝点什么来配豆煮玉米
Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
一大壶玛格丽特鸡尾酒
A pitcher of margaritas.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,170
你真想这样吗
Do you really want that?

92
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,310
这才是最精彩的地方
That's the great thing.

93
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,360
选什么无所谓
It doesn't matter.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,200
我的头脑能够有更多时间思考更重要的事情
My mind is freed up to think about more important things.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,410
那你的头脑现在想什么呢
What's it thinking about now?

96
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,730
汉堡和柠檬水
Hamburgers and lemonade.

97
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,220
拉杰  我这有个朋友想介绍给你认识
Um, Raj, there's someone I want you to meet.

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,170
这是我的朋友艾米丽  我在健身课上认识的
This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class.

99
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,290
拉杰  淡定  她听不见你说什么  她是聋人
Raj, relax. She can't hear you. She's deaf.

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,230
艾米丽  这是我们的朋友拉杰
Emily, this is our friend Raj.

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,510
看你俩多合得来呀
Look at you guys just hitting it off.

102
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,600
我真是超级红娘
I am so good.

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
你好
Hi.

104
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,600
她说"很高兴认识你"
She says, "it's nice to meet you""

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,370
她是认真的
Does she really mean that

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,840
还是在损我呀
or was she signing it sarcastically?

107
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,860
拉杰说他也很高兴认识你
Raj says it's nice to meet you, too.

108
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,590
她说她得回去陪家人了
She says she has to go back to her family,

109
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,510
但你若想发短信给她  约她出来聚聚的话
but Penny has her number if you want

110
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,070
你可以找佩妮要她的电话
to text her and get together.

111
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,130
好吧  我决定扮酷
Okay, I'm going to play it cool.

112
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,640
跟她说"再说吧  到时候再看  宝贝儿"
Tell her, "Maybe. Whatever, babe."

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,540
他会发短信给你的
He'll text you.

114
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
瞧瞧  我有约会了
Look at that. I have a date.

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,970
我又开始热爱美国了
I love America again.

116
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,390
现在到甜点了
And now for dessert...

117
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,030
拜托  朱古力新地  我要朱古力新地
Come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae.

118
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,350
哦耶  这就对了
Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,270
好吧  等她一到
Okay, as soon as she gets here,

120
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,330
既然她知道我很淡定
so she knows I'm cool with it,

121
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,360
所以我要就她的耳聋开个玩笑
I'm going to make a joke about her being deaf.

122
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,410
比如说  嘿  你听说过那个什么没有
I was thinking, "Hey, did you hear the one about...?

123
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,250
对哦  我忘了你听不见了
Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

124
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,860
你还是老老实实当回你的单身肥男好了
Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.

125
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,790
她来了
Oh, she's here.

126
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,550
别开玩笑
No joke.

127
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,740
她说她很抱歉来迟了
She says she's sorry she's late.

128
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,280
跟她说没关系
Tell her it doesn't matter.

129
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,130
跟她说她的眼睛就像是天女宫
Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies

130
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,070
湖中乳白色百合一样闪烁
in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.

131
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,380
真的吗
Really?

132
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,150
你一上来就要说这句话吗
That's the first thing you want to say?

133
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,060
我想了整晚了  就这么说
I worked on it all night. Use it.

134
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,090
我不知道"乳白色"的手语
Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.

135
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,230
那就拼出来给她看
Then spell it.

136
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,240
我不会拼
I don't know how to spell it.

137
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,620
你就非要给我搞砸了
You're blowing this for me!

138
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,330
他喜欢你的眼睛
He likes your eyes.

139
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,340
这下好了  我听上去就像是个山顶洞人
You're making me sound like a caveman.

140
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,860
她说  "谢谢  你的眼睛也很漂亮"
She says, "Thank you. You have nice eyes, too."

141
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,300
真的吗  问她想要几个孩子
Really? Ask her how many children she wants,

142
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,610
不管她说多少  你就说"我也是"
and whatever number she says, say, "Me, too."

143
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,030
不要
No.

144
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,580
好吧  那就跟她说  我的声音低沉性感
Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice

145
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,050
就像詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯一样
like James Earl Jones.
美国影星  曾给《狮子王》中老国王配音

146
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,830
她哪知道詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯的声音什么样啊
She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.

147
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,250
正好  那她就不会知道我在骗人了
Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

148
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,990
让我想想  我还能跟你说点我的什么
Let's see, what else can I tell you about me

149
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,360
来让你喜欢我呢
that would make you like me?

150
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,170
我热爱音乐
Ooh, I love music.

151
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,400
你喜欢音乐吗
Do you love music?

152
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,980
你真的要问她这个吗
You really want to ask her that?

153
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,340
也对  是人都热爱音乐啦
You're right. Everyone loves music.

154
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,900
她问  "你会弹奏乐器吗"
She says, "Do you play an instrument?"

155
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,820
不会
No,

156
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,170
但是我六岁的时候
but when I was six years old,

157
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,260
曾经想要成立一个男生乐队
I tried to start a boy band called

158
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,090
模仿Frankie Goes To Hollywood英国老牌乐队
叫"法兰基到宝莱坞"
Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

159
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,810
但是我找不到其他男生肯跟我组队
But I couldn't get any other boys to join,

160
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,540
于是我父母就只好叫我家的仆人
so my parents asked the servants

161
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,830
来做我的候补舞者
to be my backup dancers.

162
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,490
等一下  你比划"仆人"的时候
Wait, when you sign "servants",

163
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,870
别比划得好像我在炫耀一样
don't sign it like I'm bragging.

164
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,670
要比划成我很谦虚
Sign it in a way that I sound humble

165
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,170
同时又透露出"没错  我有仆人"那种感觉
with just a hint of "That's right, I had servants."

166
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,310
天啊  你还真是满嘴胡话呀
Do you hear yourself?

167
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,410
怕啥  反正她又听不见  快比划呀  长臂猿
Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.

168
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,090
我每天都给圣诞老人写一封信
I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day.

169
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,090
终于到了圣诞节的早上
And then on Christmas morning,

170
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,800
我在圣诞树下找到一只
under the tree is a little puppy

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,960
系着红缎带的小狗
with a red ribbon.

172
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,870
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

173
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,120
给伯纳黛特发短信  告诉她我今晚要晚点回去
Texting Bernadette that I'm gonna be late.

174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,450
哥们儿  她说什么呢
Dude, what is she saying?

175
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,240
她在讲一个关于狗狗的搞笑故事
It's a funny story about a puppy.

176
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,890
你就跟着笑就对了
Just smile and laugh.

177
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,640
-好了  好了  不要笑了  -怎么了
- Quick, quick, stop smiling.  - What? Why?

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,110
小狗后来死掉了  它吞了一个娃娃的头
The puppy died -- it choked on a doll head.

179
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,070
表情悲哀  表情悲哀
Sad face, sad face!

180
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,560
在城市闪耀的灯火下有点看不清楚
It's a little hard to see with the city lights,

181
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,890
但是那个W形状的星座就是仙后座
but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia.

182
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,200
旁边的是仙女座  也就是仙后座的女儿
And she was the mother of Andromeda who's over there.

183
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,960
看呀  一闪一闪亮晶晶
Look, pretty stars.

184
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,490
这是她的车
This is her car.

185
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,490
她希望下次能再见你
She hopes she can see you again sometime.

186
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,710
好呀  好呀
Good, good.

187
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,830
天啊
Oh, boy,

188
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,680
帮我一下
help me out here.

189
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,650
她想不想让我吻她
Does she want me to kiss her or not?

190
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,910
我只会打手语而已  又不会读心术
I speak sign language, I don't read minds.

191
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,490
如果你是我的话  你会不会吻她
If you were me, would you kiss her?

192
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,090
会  但哥是调情高手呀
Yeah, but I'm a make out king.

193
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,340
哥真是太会泡妞了
I was so smooth on that date.

194
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,290
就你  是我帮你泡的好不好
You? I made you smooth.

195
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,350
你就是个蠢货
You were an idiot.

196
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,990
随便你咋说  反正她亲的是我
Whatever, dude. She kissed me.

197
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,400
也许她亲的是你的嘴唇
It might've been on your lips,

198
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,850
但其实她亲的是我
but it was my kiss.

199
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,430
好吧  那就当她亲了我们两个
Oh, fine. Let's agree she kissed both of us.

200
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,740
成
Okay.

201
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,330
小胡子不错啊  谢尔顿
Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.

202
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,230
别夸我  夸骰子吧
Don't thank me. Thank the dice.

203
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,140
骰子告诉我该刮多少比例的胡子
They told me what percentage of my face to shave.

204
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,630
你怎么还在搞这个
Why are you still doing this?

205
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,800
因为这很有用
Because it's working.

206
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
这几周
In the past few weeks,

207
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,210
因为不用做琐碎的决定
unburdened by trivial decisions,

208
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,880
我已经和别人合作在著名
I've co-authored two papers

209
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,600
同行评审期刊上发表了两篇论文
in notable peer-reviewed journals,

210
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
我也就快搞清楚
and I'm close to figuring out why

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,410
大型强子对撞机
the Large Hadron Collider has yet

212
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,210
是如何分离出希格斯玻色子的
to isolate the Higgs boson particle.

213
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,970
还有个你没提  你蛋蛋擦破了
You left out, got chafed testicles

214
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,590
就因为骰子告诉你不用再穿内裤了
because you no longer wear underpants.

215
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,630
成也骰子  败也骰子
The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.

216
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,860
拉杰又和艾米丽出去了吗
Is Raj out with Emily again?

217
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,880
嗯  这个月来每晚都出去
Yeah, every night for the last month.

218
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,410
真难以置信他有女朋友了
Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.

219
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,020
我也想不到
Me neither.

220
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,010
我来爆点杰丽恋的料吧
Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front.

221
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,600
他送了她一对钻石耳环  还给她租了一辆车
He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.

222
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
真的假的
You're kidding.

223
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,670
你觉得她在占他便宜吗
You think she's taking advantage of him?

224
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,690
当然不会
Oh, of course not.

225
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,360
她不会做这种事
She wouldn't do something like that.

226
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,040
她可是聋子
She's deaf.

227
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,520
聋女就不会是拜金女吗NDeaf women can't be gold diggers?

228
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,400
残疾人都人很好  莱纳德
Handicapped people are nice, Leonard.

229
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,620
地球人都知道
Everyone knows that.

230
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,530
我知道一些关于拉杰的事
Yeah, I actually have information about Raj

231
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,060
也许对你们的讨论有帮助
that would be helpful with this discussion.

232
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,640
你能告诉我们吗
Could you tell us?

233
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,050
扔了再说
Let's see.

234
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,080
两点  不好意思了
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

235
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,310
等下
Wait, hang on.

236
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,480
双人赛  再掷一次
Doubles. Roll again.

237
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,930
好吧  听好了
Okay, get this.

238
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,680
他给她买再多礼物也无所谓
It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts,

239
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,420
因为库萨帕里家超有钱
because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.

240
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,580
你说超有钱是什么意思
What do you mean "Vastly wealthy"?

241
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,700
有钱就是指有很多钱
Well, "Wealthy" Means a lot of money.

242
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,140
加上个超就是有很多很多钱
"Vastly" Means even more.

243
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,350
这有什么听不懂的啊
I'm not sure what's tripping you up.

244
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,980
听着  我知道他们有钱  但没这么有钱吧
Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.

245
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,020
不  你错了
No, you're wrong.

246
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,900
几年前  我实现了其中一个小梦想
As you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of

247
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,880
做了一名公证人
my lesser dreams and became a notary public.

248
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,690
时不时地
Well, from time to time,

249
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,820
我要替拉杰公证一下账户记录
I notarize banking documents for Raj.

250
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,980
库萨帕里家不仅是有钱  而是超超超有钱
The Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich.

251
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,650
那是有多有钱
Well, so how much is that?

252
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,250
前者是蝙蝠侠  超有钱
后者是《圣诞欢歌》主人公  超有钱也超小气
差不多介于布鲁斯·韦恩和斯克鲁奇之间
About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.

253
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,200
搞毛
What the hell?

254
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
我们上次去动物园
The last time we went to the zoo,

255
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,370
那丫的还让我给他买西班牙油条
that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.

256
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,870
听着  伙计们  不好意思  我也不想这么无礼
Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,

257
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,870
但我得打个电话给拉杰的妹妹  我超爱的那个
but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much.

258
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,570
超超超爱的那个
So vastly much.

259
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,260
好吧  他是很有钱  买了很多礼物...还有车
Okay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car.

260
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,240
她还让他付了她所有的信用卡账单
And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.

261
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,830
啥  他还帮她付信用卡账单
What? He paid off her credit cards?

262
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,020
我靠  我怎么就没和拉杰约会几个月呢
Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months.

263
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,120
好吧  我不会这样  我不是这种人
But I-I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl.

264
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,240
我们得和拉杰谈谈
We should really talk to Raj.

265
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
他听不进的  他坠入了爱河
He's not going to listen, he's in love.

266
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,750
不知道该怎么办吗
Can't figure out what to do?

267
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,880
我也有过这种日子
I remember those days.

268
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,110
而现在  请原谅  我不得不...
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to...

269
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,020
继续留在这
stay right here.

270
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,210
这个主意太烂了
Yeah, this is a bad idea.

271
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,470
-我们还是走吧  -不
- We should go. - No.

272
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,840
是我介绍她给拉杰的
I'm the one that introduced him to her.

273
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,350
我得说点什么
I've got to say something.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,980
你和我朋友订婚了
You're engaged to my friend.

275
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,260
伯纳黛特又不介意我在哪儿变得性致勃勃
Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running,

276
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,300
只要别出轨  意淫也无妨
as long as I park in the right garage.

277
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,380
你居然和我朋友订婚了
I can't believe you're engaged to my friend.

278
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,030
她来了
Oh, here she comes.

279
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,220
真聪明啊  小声说  让那聋女听不见
Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.

280
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,740
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you.

281
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,530
我能和你谈谈拉杰吗
Um, can we talk to you about Raj?

282
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,780
她说  当然  他怎么了
She says, "Sure, what about him""

283
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,390
好吧  哎  我该怎么说呢
Okay, um, gosh, how do I start?

284
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,140
那个  拉杰其实蛮天真的
Um, see, Raj is kind of naive.

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,500
我是说  他没怎么和女人约会过
I mean, he hasn't dated a whole lot of women.

286
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,870
而我只是有点担心  没别的意思
And I'm concerned that, without meaning to,

287
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,030
你会不会可能在利用他
you might be taking advantage of him.

288
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,250
比如  让他给你买了很多奢侈品
You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.

289
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,650
而我...
And I-I...

290
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,570
霍华德  专心点
Howard, focus.

291
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,820
-告诉她我说了什么  -好
- Tell her what I'm saying. - Right.

292
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
你是拜金女在找冤大头吗
Are you a gold digger or not?

293
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,670
此处省略不礼貌用语[以下something=fucking]
Oh, uh, something, something,

294
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,350
你他妈以为你是谁
who the something do you think you are?

295
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,850
我的事关你屁事
Mind your own something business

296
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,530
滚你妹的
and go something yourself.

297
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,190
好吧  我总算懂了
Wait, I got this now.

298
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,950
我非常生你的气
I'm so mad at you!

299
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,810
好吧  等等
Okay, wait...

300
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,760
你怎么敢在健身房偷袭我女朋友
How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!

301
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,320
我们不是想偷袭她的
We didn't mean for it to be an ambush.

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,470
只是对聋子  想不偷袭都不可能
Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people.

303
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,290
你什么时候这么健谈了
And hey, since when are you so chatty?

304
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,480
我醉了
I'm hammered.

305
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,570
拉杰  进来说话
Raj, come here.

306
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,530
她是个大麻烦
This girl is trouble.

307
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,300
你们这算哪门子关系
I mean, what kind of relationship is it

308
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,550
你送礼物给她  她用性爱做回礼
where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?

309
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,960
那是我收过最好的回礼
The best one I ever had!

310
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,470
好吧  拜托
Okay, come on.

311
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,430
你知道的  你还有更好选择
You know you can do better.

312
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,760
我知道怎么回事了
I see what's going on here.

313
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,050
你我共度了疯狂一夜
You and I had our crazy night together,

314
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,320
现在你受不了我和别的女人在一起了
and now you can't stand to see me with another woman.

315
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,980
我懂的
It's okay.

316
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,250
我不会因为你吃醋而生气的
I can't get mad at your feelings.

317
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,620
我才没有吃醋呢
I don't have feelings.

318
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,550
是啊  很好
Yeah, that's good.

319
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,700
继续自欺欺人吧
Keep telling yourself that.

320
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,420
自从知道他是有钱人  他可爱多了
He is cuter now that I know he's rich.

321
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,350
我有个惊喜送给你
I have a surprise for you.

322
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,340
遮住眼睛
Cover your eyes.

323
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,300
把手放下来
Open them.

324
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,090
是天然红宝石的
It's a real ruby.

325
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,090
有点贵
It was a little expensive,

326
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,880
不过真爱是无价的
but no one can put a price on love.

327
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,510
虽然卡地亚公司让真爱变得好昂贵
Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.
卡地亚：著名奢侈珠宝品牌

328
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,600
妈妈  爸爸
Oh, Mummy, Daddy.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,840
真是意外之喜
What a nice surprise.

330
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,070
不  不是意外之喜  是意外之怒
No, it's not a nice surprise, it's a bad surprise.

331
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,650
佩妮打电话给我们了
Penny called us.

332
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,380
佩妮
Penny?

333
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,720
她告诉我们  你把我们的钱
She told us you're spending all our money

334
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,630
都挥霍在新女友身上了
on your new girlfriend.

335
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,010
我只送了她几件东西
I just got her a couple of things.

336
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,210
她也有回礼呀
She gives me things, too.

337
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,540
是  我是妇科医生
Yeah, yeah, I'm a gynecologist.

338
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,240
非常清楚她回的什么礼给你
I know exactly what she gives you.

339
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,390
你得找个门当户对的印度姑娘
You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family.

340
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,530
你要是继续跟她好  就拿不到我们的钱
If you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off.

341
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,250
什么  你们让我在深爱的女人
What? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love

342
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,950
和强烈吸引我的金钱之间做抉择
and the money I... have very strong feelings for?

343
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,720
你自己决定吧
It's up to you.

344
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,980
好吧  我选爱情
Well, I choose love.

345
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
你个笨蛋
You're an idiot.

346
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,240
爱情好比昙花一现
Love doesn't last.

347
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,220
他最终会发现的
Well, he's going to find out eventually.

348
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,040
好好想想吧
Think about it.

349
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,720
我父母让我在钱和你之间作选择
My parents are making me choose between money and you.

350
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,300
我选了你
I choose you.

351
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,840
不  那车得退回去
No, I think we'll have to return the car.

352
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,510
那项链  也得退
And that necklace, yeah, that, too.

353
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,400
但那些都不重要
But none of those things matter,

354
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
因为我们有更好的
because we have something better.

355
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,460
我们有爱
We have love.

356
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,660
佩妮  我心都碎了
Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.

357
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,410
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

358
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,240
有时候我会把电视静音
Sometimes I put the TV on mute

359
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,250
就为了假装她还和我在一起
just to pretend she's still with me.

360
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,260
但我一看那隐藏字幕  就忍不住哭
But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.

361
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,770
我真为你痛心
Oh, I'm so sorry.

362
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,840
真希望能让你心情好点
I wish I could make you feel better.

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,590
什么人啊
Seriously?

364
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,920
我心都碎了  你还要勾引我
I'm heartbroken and you're hitting on me?

365
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
什么  不是的
What?! No!

366
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,250
佩妮  你是个好人[著名的好人卡]
Look, Penny, you're great,

367
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,940
但我跟父母长谈了一番
but I had a long talk with my parents,

368
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,640
他们说只要我跟印度女孩约会
and they said if I date an Indian girl,

369
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,050
就送我辆玛莎拉蒂
I get a Maserati.

370
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,970
哇  芝士蛋糕
Oh, cheesecake,

371
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,570
你跟女人一样美味
you're just as good as a woman,

372
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,270
即便我不能跟你上床
even though I can't have sex with you.

373
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,320
放微波炉里热几秒再试试[然后再捅进去]
Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.

374
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,490
我该现在上厕所呢  还是等回家再上
Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home?

375
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,740
小乖乖  爸爸需要排空膀胱
Come on, papa needs to void his bladder.

376
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,280
喝了三杯酸奶之后  可不想看到这结果
Oh, that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks.

377
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,850
账单来了  各位
Here you go, boys.

378
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,420
把钱准备好了  我再过来
I'll pick it up when you're ready.

379
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,120
谢谢请客  兄弟
Thanks for dinner, buddy.

380
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,940
是啊  你真是大方
Yeah, real big of you.

381
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,910
快点  快点  快点
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

382
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
小费可不准少给了啊
Oh, and don't cheap out on the tip.

383
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,170
我们都知道你是阔少
We all know you're loaded now.
