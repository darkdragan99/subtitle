1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,760
今天是中午的班呀
You work the lunch shift?

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,590
是啊  我还带了八磅快坏的鲑鱼回来
Yeah. I've got eight pounds of salmon that's about to go bad.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,980
你知道怎么煮吗
Do you know how to cook it?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,760
-不知道  -该死
- Not really.  - Damn it.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,100
早知道就应该拿那些问题鸡肉
Should have liberated the iffy chicken.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,310
你和那个挑剔鬼今晚有啥节目
What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,730
看蓝光版星球大战
Star Wars on Blu-ray.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,730
你们不是已经看了N遍了吗
Haven't you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,160
蓝光版的没有啊
Not on Blu-ray.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,090
蓝光的只看了两遍
Only twice on Blu-ray.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,290
可悲啊  莱纳德
Oh, Leonard.

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,220
我知道  都是高清惹的祸
I know, it's high-resolution sadness.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,520
我今晚打算去看一场电影
Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,680
你想去吗
You want to go?

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,150
真的吗  我们能去吗
Really? Do we do that?

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,380
你什么意思
What do you mean?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,620
你也知道  自从咱俩分手以后
You know, we haven't spent time alone together

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,120
就没单独出去玩过
since we broke up.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,370
莱纳德  这又不是约会
Oh, it's not a date, Leonard.

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,120
只是一个男人和一个女人出去玩
It's just a man and a woman hanging out,

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,260
晚上各回各家  各睡各床
not having sex at the end of the night.

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,210
这是我大多数约会的真实写照
Sounds like most of my dates.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,610
老天呐  离我远点  你个怪物
Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!

24
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,240
这是怎么回事
What is that about?

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,110
他够聪明也够疯狂
Well, he's smart and crazy enough,

26
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,510
没准真造了个怪物出来
he may have actually created a monster.

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,350
去  去  快走
Shoo, shoo! Be gone!

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,880
hell双关  亦有地狱的意思
到底是怎么了
What the hell is going on?

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,290
窗户外面有只鸟  死活不肯走
There's a bird outside the window, and he won't go away.

30
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,230
弄得我跟人间炼狱似的
That is the hell that is going on.

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,160
我们这儿既没虫子也没种子
We have no worms or seeds here.

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,670
去去  快走
Shoo! Shoo!

33
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,360
不是吧  这世界那么险恶  你怕的却是小鸟
Really? On top of everything else, you're afraid of birds?

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,660
这叫恐鸟症
It's called ornithophobia.

35
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,190
而且总有一天  恐鸟症会被视为一种残疾
And someday it will be recognized as a true disability,

36
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,990
房东必须按照法律规定
and the landlord will be required by law

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
给这栋楼加一张大网
to put a giant net over the building.

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,200
到时就悲剧了  因为我还怕网
Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,750
电影  你去不去
So movies, yes or no?

40
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,390
去  一定去
Movies, yes.

41
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,870
好  待会儿见
Great. I'll see you later.

42
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,940
记住啦  他其实比你还害怕呢
And remember, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,840
说这话一点用都没有
That doesn't help.

44
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,010
谁跟你说了  我跟鸟说呢
No, I was talking to the bird.

45
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,390
小鸟快走  小鸟快走  小鸟快走
Go away, bird. Go away, bird. Go away, bird.

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,180
谢尔顿  无视它不就行了
Sheldon, just ignore him.

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,670
好主意  这鸟无非就是求关注
Good idea. Attention is what birds want.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
啊  好多了  好
Oh, much better. All right.

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
我现在可以安心了
Now I'll just get along with my life.

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,370
泡壶茶  莱纳德  今晚要跟它抗争到底了
Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It's going to be a long night.

51
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,830
生活大爆炸第五季第九集

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,530
那鸟还没走呢
The bird's still there?

53
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,920
快  老鹰是怎么叫的
Quick, what does a hawk sound like?

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,650
我也不太清楚
I don't know--

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,030
拜托  那是海鸥的声音
Please, that's a seagull.

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,080
你要是帮不上忙  就闭嘴
If you're not going to help, don't help.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,030
对不起  我穿得会不会太正式了
Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?

58
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,100
这得看场合了
It depends on the activity.

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,460
如果去做前列腺检查  是有点正式
For a prostate exam, yes.

60
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,670
惊奇漫画角色
但如果是扮维加斯  我会加一些亮片
If you're playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
我是要跟佩妮去看电影
I'm going to the movies with Penny.

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,810
我不想让她认为  我认为是约会
I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.

63
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,730
你认为是约会吗
Do you think it's a date?

64
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,710
不  但她会认为我是这么认为
No, but she might think I think it's a date

65
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,510
但其实我不是
even though I don't.

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,300
说不定是你认为她认为你这么认为
Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date

67
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,350
其实她不是
even though she doesn't.

68
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,380
-我们是不是想太多了  -绝对没有
- Are we overthinking this?  - Not at all.

69
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
你说得对  算了  我就这么穿吧
You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,660
不是吧  西装?  好吧
Really? A blazer? All right.

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,330
喂  你好
Yes, hello.

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,260
我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

73
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,190
我住在罗夫莱斯北大街2311号
I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue.

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,900
我这里有一只危险的野生动物
I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal.

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,260
一只蓝冠鸦
A blue jay.

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,110
不好意思  我找的就是动物管理部门
I'm sorry, this is Animal Control.

77
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,070
我不明白你笑什么
I don't understand the laughter.

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,660
不  那只鸟不在我家里
No, the bird is not in my home.

79
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,040
它要是在我家里  我早就打911报警了
If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911.

80
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,890
先生  我相信你也有害怕的东西
Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of.

81
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,130
比如从事没前途的公共服务工作
Being stuck in a dead-end public service job.

82
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,040
或者你老婆背叛你
Or your wife stepping out on you

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,600
因为你从事的是没前途的公共服务工作
because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job.

84
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,400
又或者你怕蜘蛛
Or spiders.

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,280
学猫叫有用的话  打电话给你干嘛
Don't you think I tried making cat noises?

86
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,880
会不会太休闲了
Too casual?

87
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,720
去觐见女王的话  是太休闲了
For an audience with the queen, yes.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
不过晚上去着火的垃圾箱旁边
For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
扔一瓶烈酒  你的着装正合适
around a flaming trash can, you look great.

90
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,230
我想啥呢  居然没画胡子
What am I thinking? Whiskers.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,690
现在买票的话  能赶上珍妮弗·安妮斯顿的新电影
Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.

92
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,230
对  没错
Oh, yeah, sure.

93
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,460
不过还有一场精彩的纪录片
There's also an amazing documentary

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,300
讲述在南美洲的一条河上建一座水坝
about building a dam on a river in South America.

95
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,560
可珍妮弗·安妮斯顿的电影里有珍妮弗·安妮斯顿
Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston,

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,490
而且她不会建什么水坝
and she's not building a dam.

97
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,210
这倒是真的
Can't argue with that.

98
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,310
-我去买票  -好
- I'll get the tickets.  - Okay.

99
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,380
等等  其实呢
Actually, you know what?

100
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,400
我觉得现在该我挑电影了
I think it's about time I picked a movie we see.

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,760
你都挑过好多次了
You pick plenty of movies.

102
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,830
不  都是你挑的
No. You always picked,

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
而且每次都一样
and it was always the same.

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,700
前面90分钟都在说雨中的海滨别墅
An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain

105
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,310
最后女主角顿时醒悟
until the woman turns around

106
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,280
发现原来爱一直在身边
and realizes love was here all along.

107
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,070
拜托  那电影很棒  而且还有10分钟就开演了
Come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,900
我讨厌这种电影
I hate those movies.

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
-你不讨厌  -我真的讨厌
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

110
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,010
我之所以以前和你一起看  是因为你想看
The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them,

111
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,790
而我想和你滚床单
and I wanted to have sex.

112
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,500
而今天  我既然不能兴奋和性奋
To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,340
还看什么桑德拉·布洛克的电影啊
without getting both bored and aroused.

114
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,550
好吧  这么说我们约会的时候
Okay, so while we were going out,

115
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,000
你有多少次是假装听我的
how often would you pretend

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,150
其实只是为了和我滚床单
to like things just to have sex with me?

117
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,490
一直都是
All the time.

118
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
不是吧
You're kidding.

119
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,820
那你觉得这些话耳熟不
Does this sound familiar?

120
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,790
我喜欢和你去逛街买鞋子
I'd love to go shoe shopping with you.

121
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
远足  棒极了
Hiking? It's great.

122
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,580
凌晨2点啊  我当然想去
It' 2 a.m., of course I want to go

123
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,750
韩国城和你们朋友唱K啦
to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends.

124
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,390
乐意之极
Who wouldn't?

125
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,520
好吧  我们每次约会
Okay, we were going out.

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,020
-那次没有滚床单的  -是吗
- You were going to get sex anyway. - Really?

127
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,890
你要是看了三小时水坝的纪录片  你还有性致吗
You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?

128
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,950
没有  没女人会有
No. No woman would.

129
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,330
瞧  这就是最棒的地方
See? Now, that's the great thing.

130
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,130
我们现在是朋友  不是在约会
We're out as friends. This is not a date.

131
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,670
滚床单没戏
Sex is off the table.

132
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,240
所以  我们就去看看水力发电
So, let's go learn how hydroelectric power

133
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,470
也许不是你想的那么环保
might not be the environmental bargain you think it is.

134
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,790
抱歉  剧透了
Sorry. Spoiler alert.

135
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,240
好吧
All right, fine.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,250
谢了
Thanks.

137
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,310
电影票十一块
Tickets are 11 bucks.

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,140
不是约会嘛
Not a date.

139
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,110
快点  谢尔顿  来看《星球大战》
Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.

140
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,140
我要按播放键啦  我说真的
I'm pushing play. I mean it.

141
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,940
要是我们再不快点看
If we don't start soon,

142
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,170
乔治·卢卡斯又要出新版本了
George Lucas is going to change it again.

143
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,220
要是你那职业学校的学历有点用
This would go a lot faster

144
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,890
就过来帮我倒腾一下这台高音频发生器
if you put your trade school diploma to work

145
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,750
那我们的问题就解决了
and helped me set up this high-frequency tone generator.

146
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,060
我可是麻省理工的硕士生
I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.

147
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,660
好吧  你好歹有乐观苦干的态度
Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude

148
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,130
这才是重点
and that's what's important.

149
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,010
我真不懂你和鸟有什么仇
I really don't get your problem with birds.

150
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,820
你该这么问  鸟对我有什么仇
The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me?

151
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,910
我刚开始记事起  一只蜂鸟俯冲进我的婴儿车
My first memory: A hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller

152
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,330
偷吃了我吸管杯里的苹果汁
to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.

153
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,960
蜂鸟很美的
Hummingbirds are pretty.

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,520
蜂鸟是鲜花界的吸血鬼
Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,070
还是我在脚踝纹身图案的首选
Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo.

156
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,350
或是海豚  我在这两者间犹豫不决
Or a dolphin-- I go back and forth.

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,990
我7岁时  一只丧心病狂的鸡追着我爬到树上
Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree.

158
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,330
12岁时  一只喜鹊想从我嘴里抢走牙套
Age 12, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth.

159
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,570
16岁时  宠物店的一只鹦鹉骂我胖仔
Age 16, a parrot in a pet store calls me fat ass.

160
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,340
我还要继续说吗
Need I go on?

161
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,570
当然  这可比电影有趣多了
Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.

162
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,120
好吧  谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon,

163
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,210
你的"杀鸟死光"准备好了
your bird death ray is ready.

164
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,780
这不是"死光"
It's not a death ray.

165
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,890
只是弄点超声波好吓跑他
It's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off.

166
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,890
相信我  如果我有"死光"
Trust me, if I had a death ray,

167
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,770
我就不会住这儿了
I wouldn't be living here.

168
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,200
我会坐在用不完的钱堆上
I'd be in my lair enjoying the money

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,310
都是人们送来贿赂我求我别用"死光"
the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray.

170
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,350
好吧  三
All right, and in three,

171
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,510
二  一
two, one.

172
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,860
这只小鸟真霸气
That is one tough birdie.

173
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,830
拜托  你明明很喜欢那电影
Come on, you enjoyed the movie.

174
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,330
村庄要被淹没  所有人要搬家时
I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded,

175
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,490
我看你都哭了
and everyone had to relocate.

176
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,930
不  我是想为什么他们能走而我不行
No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.

177
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,760
我去买点薯条
I'm going to get some fries.

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,580
你要来点吗
You want anything?

179
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,750
-不  谢了  -你确定吗
- Uh, no, thanks.  - Are you sure?

180
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,920
你每次都说不要  却把我的吃掉一半
You always say no, and then you eat half my fries.

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
我只是吃那些酥脆的  反正你不喜欢
I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.

182
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,060
不  我超喜欢  我只是留到最后吃
No, I love them. I save them for the end,

183
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,130
结果却被你吃光光
but they're gone because you ate them.

184
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,740
我为什么让你吃呢
And why did I let you eat them?

185
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,570
-你想滚床单  -没错
- To get sex.  - Exactly.

186
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,740
但这不是约会
But this is not a date.

187
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,210
所以我再问一次  你要来点什么吗
So I ask again, would you like anything?

188
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,910
好吧  给我来份薯条
All right, I'd like an order of fries.

189
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,320
好极了  五块钱
Great. That'll be five dollars.

190
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,270
这是我有史以来最开心的夜晚
I am having the best time.

191
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,750
我真高兴你约我出来
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

192
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,680
不好意思
Oh, sorry.

193
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,790
没关系
No problem.

194
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,510
你在写什么
What you writing there?

195
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,240
剧本
A screenplay.

196
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
叙述的是一个宅男的室友因为要打炮
It's about a guy whose roommate is having sex

197
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,430
所以把他赶来酒吧写剧本的悲惨故事
and tells him to go to a bar and work on his screenplay.

198
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,830
电影名《我希望艾力克斯染上阴虱》
"I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie."

199
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,980
这只是暂定名
It's a working title.

200
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,630
-我叫凯文  -我叫佩妮
- I'm Kevin.  - Oh. Penny.

201
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,790
幸会幸会
Nice to meet you.

202
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,760
我就不打扰你们约会了
I'll let you get back to your date.

203
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,900
不不  我们没在约会  完全不是
Oh, no, no. This isn't a date, no.

204
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,590
对吧
Right?

205
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,110
对
Uh... right.

206
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,570
那你的作品有没有我可能看过的呢
So have you written anything I might have seen?

207
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,410
不好说  你喜欢逛大众点评网吗
That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?

208
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,410
真是太傻了
This is ridiculous.

209
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,330
我都是个来自德州的成年人了
I'm a grown man from Texas.

210
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,680
这鸷鸟肯定不像天鹅和家鹅那么吓人
This isn't a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose.

211
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,560
一只蓝松鸦而已
It's just a blue jay.

212
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,640
还是只挺大的蓝松鸦
That's a pretty big blue jay.

213
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,660
一
One...

214
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,730
二
Two...

215
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,000
三
Three.

216
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,770
去去  死鸟  快走开
Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay!

217
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,490
鸟飞进屋子了
Bird in the apartment!

218
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,970
鸟飞进屋子了
Bird in the apartment!

219
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,090
不要啊
No!

220
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,590
这部纪录片太赞了
So it is an amazing documentary.

221
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
他们急需建座大坝来发电  但同时
They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time,

222
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,820
他们也想保护环境
they want to preserve the environment.

223
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,050
真会过河拆桥呀
You're kidding me.

224
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,070
你能稍微过来一下吗
Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?

225
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,670
当然可以  等我一下哦
Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?

226
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,000
没问题
No problem.

227
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,730
有事吗
What's up?

228
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,370
-我知道你在耍什么小把戏  -耍什么
- I know what you're doing. - What am I doing?

229
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,240
你千方百计地勾搭那哥们儿聊天
You're going out of your way to talk to that guy

230
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,170
就因为我说咱俩没在约会
because I said we weren't on a date.

231
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,910
才没有  我跟他聊是因为他很帅
No, I'm talking to him because he's cute.

232
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,380
-拜托  他哪有那么帅  -不  他就是很帅
- Come on, he's not that cute. - Yes, he is.

233
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,260
看那件傻傻的T恤和那副潮潮的小眼镜
With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.

234
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,680
我也穿傻傻的T恤  也戴着小眼镜
I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

235
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,870
是呀  等你个子和颧骨都高点再说吧
Yes, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones,

236
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,830
你现在就是人家的反面教材
you're doing it ironically.

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,270
如果这样的话  要是我也去跟女孩子聊天呢
If that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?

238
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,240
快去啊
You should!

239
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,040
我是说真的  我真去哦
I'm serious. I'll do it.

240
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,700
去啊  快去啊  那边有好几个漂亮妹子
Good! Go! There are some girls right over there.

241
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,660
你怎么还不冲过去
What are you waiting for?

242
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,270
她们人好多  我好怕怕
They're in a group. I'm scared.

243
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,040
谢尔顿  你指望我俩来干啥
Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?

244
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,650
你是生物学家
You're biologists.

245
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,520
生物就是研究生物的
Biology is the study of living things.

246
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,590
那就是个生物  开始研究吧
That's a living thing; get cracking.

247
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,860
我是搞微生物学的
I specialize in microorganisms,

248
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,600
艾米是研究大脑的
and Amy studies brains.

249
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,530
对啊  我俩都没辅修过如何赶鸟
Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.

250
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,280
拜托
Oh, come now.

251
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,110
你们在本科的时候肯定学过
Your undergraduate work must have included

252
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,110
如何对付讨人嫌的小动物
a varmints and critters class.

253
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,740
进来吧  谢尔顿  他不会伤害你的
Come back in, Sheldon, he's not going to hurt you.

254
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,000
他看上去好和善的
He looks friendly.

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,130
我觉得他没准儿是谁家的宠物
I think he might be someone's pet.

256
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,900
不要  伯纳黛特  别逞英雄
No, Bernadette, don't be a hero!

257
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,360
他真可爱
Oh, he's a sweetie.

258
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
对  很可爱
Yes. It's very sweet.

259
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
好  现在慢慢地  小心地
Now, slowly and carefully,

260
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,710
把他丢到厕所里冲走
flush him down the toilet.

261
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,790
谢尔顿  克服这种恐惧的唯一办法
Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear

262
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,340
就是参与进来
is to interact with it.

263
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,230
就像你对付那个邮递员那样
Just like you did with the mailman.

264
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,090
全世界每年都有好几十个人被鸟害死
Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds.

265
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,200
我不要为这个统计数据作贡献
I'm not going to be another statistic.

266
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,120
你看看他有多可爱  过来打个招呼嘛
Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi.

267
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,450
来啊
Come on.

268
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,880
你能行的
You can do it.

269
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,560
别怕
Don't be scared.

270
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,350
快来
Come on.

271
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,620
快摸一下  你个胆小鬼
Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!

272
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,600
我做到了
I did it!

273
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,540
我真的做到了
I actually did it.

274
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,360
好了  可以扔进厕所冲了
Okay, now flush him.

275
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,550
莱纳德  你平时有什么爱好
So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

276
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,240
我  我想想看哈
I'm... let's see.

277
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,100
远足
Hiking.

278
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,390
去韩国城K歌
Karaoke in Koreatown.

279
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,050
看杰尼佛·安妮斯顿的电影
Any Jennifer Aniston movie.

280
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,900
不好意思刚冷落了你
Hey. Sorry I ditched you.

281
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,950
-没事没事  你去忙你的吧  -没事  不忙了
- No, it's fine. You can ditch away.  - Oh, no, no.

282
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,300
我们说好一起出来玩的嘛  一起玩吧
We said we were going to hang out, let's hang out.

283
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,030
没事  你跟凯文玩吧
It's cool. Go back to Kevin.

284
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,700
他走了
Oh, he had to leave.

285
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,460
有意思
Interesting.

286
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,830
所以现在是他走了  你又想跟我玩了
So now that he's gone, you want to hang out with me.

287
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,430
-这位肯定是佩妮  -对
- This must be Penny.  - Yep.

288
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,960
让我茅塞顿开呀
I totally get it.

289
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,640
不好意思  哪里塞了
Huh? I'm sorry, get what?

290
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,520
你别管了  那边有好几个帅哥哥
Don't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there.

291
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,310
你去跟他们聊聊呗
You should go talk to them.

292
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,130
不了  我就想知道你跟她说什么了
No, no. I want to know what you told her.

293
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,330
这应该是我和...
That's kind of between me and...

294
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,260
-劳拉  -劳拉之间的秘密吧
- Laura.  - Laura.

295
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,900
好吧  明白了
Oh. Okay, I see.

296
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,990
他跟你聊天时  有没有提到他拥有不止一件
So while he was telling you things,did he mention he owns,

297
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,390
而是两件星际迷航制服呢
not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?

298
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,490
-真的吗  -真的  还经常穿
- Really?  - Yeah. Wears them.

299
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,960
不光万圣节哦
Not just for Halloween.

300
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
嘿  伙计
Hey, pal.

301
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,630
我可没告诉凯文
You didn't see me telling Kevin that

302
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,100
你认为冷战只在冬天开战
you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.

303
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,340
好吧  那我就还你人情  不告诉...
Okay. Then I'll return the favor, and I won't tell...

304
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,740
-劳拉  -劳拉
- Laura. ...  - Laura

305
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,880
你收藏的黄片  一半是动画片
that half the dirty movies you own are animated.

306
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,220
你向凯文讲述你的演艺生涯时
When you were telling Kevin about your acting career,

307
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,180
有提到你在本土商家芝士工厂内
did you mention your long-running role as "Waitress"

308
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,510
长期"扮演"女服务生的角色吗
in a local production of The Cheese Factory?

309
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,410
那你告诉了她  你有哮喘了吗
Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?

310
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,500
是吗  那你说说"哮喘"怎么写
Oh, yeah? Spell "asthma."

311
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,710
都是口字旁...
A-s...

312
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,230
送我回家
Take me home.

313
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,030
我还没跟她聊够呢
Maybe I'm not done hanging out with...

314
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
你说得对  太晚了
You're right, it's getting late.

315
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,870
真是奇了怪了
It's remarkable.

316
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,240
我居然怕了这么长时间
All that time spent in fear.

317
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,140
何必呢
And for what?

318
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,850
他真是太美了
He's magnificent.

319
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,210
天啊
Oh, dear.

320
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,600
我刚想起  我还没给你上饮料
I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.

321
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,390
就像我祖母跟她的鹦鹉一样
Oh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot.

322
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,900
尤其在遥控器不好使后  这么喂还能顺便换台
And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.

323
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,970
我电话在那边桌上
My phone's on the desk over there.

324
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,050
给我们俩拍张照片
Take a picture of us together.

325
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,210
拍好点  我要贴上马克杯  鼠标垫和日历
Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar.

326
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,420
你要是鸽子  我就叫你爱鸽
If you were a dove, I'd call you Lovey-Dovey.

327
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,110
开什么玩笑
Oh. Who am I kidding?

328
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,350
现在就不该拘泥于字面意思
This isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal.

329
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,220
你就是我的爱鸽  不是吗
You're just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren't you?

330
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,450
估计你的骨头也是中空的
Guess you gotta have hollow bones
鸟儿的骨头是中空的  以利于飞行

331
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,090
才能承载这么多甜言蜜语
to get some sugar around here.

332
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,530
我还是觉得他是别人家的宠物
I still think he looks like someone's pet.

333
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,600
或许我们该去贴失物招领
Maybe we should put up posters.

334
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,970
对  要附上他的一张大照片
Yes. It should have a big picture of him,

335
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,300
还要写上"这是你的鸟吗  现在成我的了"
and the words, "Is this your bird? Not anymore."

336
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,370
我们在一起肯定会很开心
We're going to have so much fun together.

337
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,330
你可以帮我捎口信给我所有的敌人
You can carry messages to all my enemies.

338
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,030
还可以在你腿上系上绳  像放风筝拽着玩
I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.

339
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,110
你要想收留他  我可以借你个笼子
If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow.

340
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,000
那笼子以前关的实验猴  踩到香蕉皮
One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
把脖子摔断了
and broke his neck.

342
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,150
悲剧和喜剧同时上演
It was both tragic and hysterical.

343
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,780
荒谬
Nonsense.

344
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,920
不行  爱鸽才不睡笼子里
No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage.

345
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,260
爱鸽要睡在他自己的巢里
No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest,

346
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,730
我要把窗台的巢拿下来  放我房间里
which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room.

347
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,100
对不对呀  爱鸽
Isn't that right, LD?

348
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,640
别走呀
No.

349
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,270
你要去哪
Where are you going?

350
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,370
回来  爱鸽
Come back, Lovey-Dovey!

351
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,040
现在这才是你的家
This is your home now!

352
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,250
我已经从亚马逊订了20磅鸟食
I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon!

353
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,020
他不见了
He's gone.

354
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,290
节哀顺变  谢尔顿
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

355
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,740
他怎么能这么对我呢
How could he do this to me?

356
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,950
回来  笨鸟  不然我的爱给谁去
Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!

357
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
您见过这只鸟吗
请联系：s.cooperphd@yahoo.com

358
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,920
好了  我们一起出去了
Okay. So... we went out,

359
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,490
看了电影  认识了不错的人
saw a movie, met some nice people,

360
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,820
公开说了一些彼此的坏话
said horrible things about each other in public...

361
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,160
总而言之  真是个神奇的夜晚
all in all, a pretty magical night.

362
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,330
好吧  这事我也有错
Okay, I'm not innocent in all this,

363
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,330
但你居然说我笨  你个患哮喘的蠢蛋
but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.

364
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,440
我知道  我是过分了
I know, I-I-I crossed a line.

365
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,170
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

366
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,400
别走  等等  我是真的很抱歉
No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it.

367
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,130
这并不是像我们以前交往那样
And it's not like when we were going out,

368
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,960
我不是为了跟你滚床单才道歉的
I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed.

369
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,800
这句"我很抱歉"是纯发自内心  与滚床单无关
This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table "I'm sorry."

370
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,040
好吧  谢谢你
All right. Thank you.

371
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,270
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry, too.

372
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,500
我再确认下  滚床单没戏  对吧
Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?

373
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,150
绝对没戏
Way off.

374
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,960
也许我们还没准备好像朋友一样出去玩
Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.

375
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,350
我也不知道  其实在事情搞砸之前
I don't know. Up until the last part,

376
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,440
我还是很喜欢管着莱纳德
I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard

377
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,120
当他的主心骨
with a little backbone.

378
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,970
我来选电影  我知道他想要什么
Picking the movie, knowing what he wants,

379
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,510
还有点自大
a little cocky.

380
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,610
-真的吗  -真的
- Really?  - Yeah.

381
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,230
好吧  那就是说滚床单有戏咯
Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table.

382
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,220
你觉得怎么样
What do you think about that?

383
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,320
-或许我会喜欢  -是吗
- Ooh. Maybe I like it. - You do?

384
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,230
真的  要是你喜欢  我可以恢复原样
Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy.

385
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,990
我发誓  你让我往东我绝不往西
I swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.

386
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,660
晚安  莱纳德
Good night, Leonard.

387
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,240
我还真是个患哮喘的蠢蛋
I am such an asthmatic dumbass.

388
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,640
我今晚过得很怪怪的
I had a weird night.

389
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,080
我过得很好
Mine was great.

390
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,810
我要当妈咪了
I'm going to be a mommy!
