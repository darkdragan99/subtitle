1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,630
我今天收到了一封超牛叉的邮件
So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,340
哥们儿  不是我要泼你冷水
I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,250
但那些阴茎增大丸真心不管用啊
but those penile enlargement pills do not work.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,020
相信我  我懂的
Believe me, I know.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,550
那封邮件是来自史蒂芬·霍金的办公室
The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,790
-不可能吧  -为啥
- You're kidding. - Why?

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,100
他要来我们学校讲几周的课
He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,540
所以想找个工程师来帮他
and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,260
维护轮椅上的设备
the equipment on his wheelchair.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,450
太赞了
That's amazing.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,280
你就是他的赛车维修员啊
You'll be like his pit crew.

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,820
提醒你一下  我可不会
A word of caution: I would not do

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,220
在他面前模仿他说话
your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,420
你说得对
You're right.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,000
我觉得这么做是挺没礼貌的
I suppose that could be considered offensive.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,530
伙计  谢尔顿会疯掉的
Boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,290
是啊  他特别崇拜霍金
Yeah, he worships Hawking.

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,960
我其实有考虑带他过去
I was actually thinking about bringing him along

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,530
好让他见见自己的偶像
when I go over there so he can meet the great man.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,120
你真是个大善人啊  霍华德
That's really nice of you, Howard.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,400
举手之劳啦
It's no big deal.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,930
天啊  霍金也会去申请一张限制令的吧
Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,900
加上莱纳德·尼莫伊  卡尔·萨根
It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got
三人依次为《星际迷航》史波克扮演者、著名天文学家
美国漫画大师  作品包括《蜘蛛侠》《神奇四侠》等

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,550
和斯坦·李对他的限制令  硕果累累呀
from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,360
莱纳德  你还记得有一次我说
Leonard, do you recall when I said

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,120
我将彻底改变人们对希格斯玻色子的理解
that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,250
然后你说
of the Higgs boson particle, and you said,

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,470
"谢尔顿  现在是凌晨两点  滚出我的卧室"吗
"Sheldon, it's 2:00 a.m., get out of my bedroom"?

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,270
不就是今天凌晨吗
Like it was ten hours ago.

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,180
怎么了
What about it?

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,810
我觉得我成功了
Well, I believe I've done it.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
我说"我觉得"只是为表谦虚
And I'm only saying "believe" to sound modest,

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
因为  感谢上帝  我成功了
because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,520
-真的假的  -太牛了  给
- Really? - That's incredible. Oh, here.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,690
式子列给我们看看
Break out the math.

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,120
行  我看看
Oh, okay, let me see this.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,450
看  这个粒子
All right, so this particle here

38
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,060
是随时间演化的玻色子
is the boson moving forward in time.

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,950
我之前考虑的是...
Now, I was thinking...

40
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,140
霍华德  你就先吃吧
Howard, you go ahead and eat.

41
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,620
你肯定一点儿都听不懂
This isn't going to make any sense to you.

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,920
谢尔顿  我对物理还是懂不少的
Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.

43
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,190
是吗  很好  继续努力
Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,700
你还打算跟他说
Are you still going to tell him

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,750
-那个人的事吗  -说啊
- about you-know-who? - Yep.

46
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,980
那你还打算引见他吗
Are you still going to introduce him?

47
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,510
这辈子都别想了
Not on your life.

48
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,910
生活大爆炸第五季第二十一集

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,810
求你了  求你了  求你了嘛
Please, please, please,

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,600
让我见见霍金吧
let me meet Hawking.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
我都说了不行了
I told you, no.

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,310
可我都道歉了
But I said I'm sorry.

53
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,870
不对  你说的是"要是我道歉  管用吗"
No, you said, "Would it help if I said I'm sorry?"

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,580
然后你都没回应我
And you never answered me.

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,740
瞧  现在该道歉的是谁
So who owes whom an apology now?

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,620
谢尔顿  你是个傲慢的混蛋
Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,120
我干嘛要帮你这种人的忙呀
Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,060
死后好上犹太天堂吗
To go to Jewish heaven?
犹太教圣经不包含基督教新约所展现的天堂地狱观

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,450
犹太人没有天堂
Jews don't have heaven.

60
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,560
那是为了避免下犹太地狱吗
Then to avoid Jewish hell?

61
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,970
你见过我妈吗吧
Have you met my mother?

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,410
我不住地狱  谁算住地狱
I live in Jewish hell.

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
霍华德  求求你了
Howard, please.

64
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,310
这可是史蒂芬·霍金啊
This is Stephen Hawking.

65
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,640
也许是唯一一个智商和我相当的人
Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,380
你别搞笑了
Oh, you can't be serious.

67
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,850
你设身处地地替我想想
Try to put yourself in my place.

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,290
假设你的星球都是狗狗
Imagine you're the sole human being

69
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,740
而你是唯一一个人类
living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs.

70
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,290
然后突然发现
And then it turns out

71
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,470
这星球上还有一个人类
there's another human being.

72
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,380
打住
Hang on.

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,630
你是说除了你俩  其他人都是狗狗吗
Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?

74
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,170
好吧  我就知道你会误解我的意思
Okay, I can see you're going to take this the wrong way.

75
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,140
我换个说法吧
Let me try again.

76
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,850
假设你的星球都是大猩猩
Imagine you're the sole human being

77
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,160
而你是唯一一个人类
living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.

78
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,620
滚出去
Get out of my lab.

79
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,980
大猩猩比狗狗聪明多了
Oh, now they're so much smarter than dogs.

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,900
你见过它们骑小自行车吗
Have you seen them on those little bicycles?

81
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,190
出去
Get out.

82
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,700
那换成海豚  好不
How about dolphins?

83
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,750
滚
Out!

84
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,840
说吧  跟霍金度过的第一天感觉如何
So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,860
超赞的
It was great.

86
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,330
我们聊了电影
We talked about movies...

87
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,190
神啊
Oh...

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
我给他变了几个扑克牌魔术
I showed him some card tricks...

89
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
神啊
Oh!

90
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,900
他还让我给他念了几页他的新书
He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.

91
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,680
神啊
Oh!

92
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,720
什么事让你这么失望呀  亲爱的
Something got you down there, bunky?

93
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,480
霍华德  求求你了
Howard, please, I'm begging you.

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,180
拉杰  你是咱们这帮人里记性最好的
Raj, you're our group historian.

95
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,880
谢尔顿以前求过人吗
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,190
求过三次
Three times.

97
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,820
他求过福克斯电视网不要砍掉《萤火虫》
He begged the Fox network not to cancel <i>Firefly.</i>

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,600
他求过TNT电视网砍掉《巴比伦五号》
He begged the TNT network to cancel <i>Babylon 5.</i>

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,630
他在玫瑰碗橄榄球赛游行时食物中毒
And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade,

100
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,370
还求过一个他不信奉的神
he begged a deity he doesn't believe in

101
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,980
让他死得痛快
to end his life quickly.

102
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,670
你知道霍金对我来说有多重要吗
Do you understand how important Hawking is to me?

103
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,640
我六岁的时候
When I was six years old,

104
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,880
万圣节扮的就是他
I dressed up as him for Halloween.

105
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,210
开玩笑的吧
You're kidding.

106
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,170
绝对没有  我拿了我爸的写字椅
No, sir, no, I took my dad's desk chair,

107
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,780
装上一个拼说语音学习机
attached a Speak & Spell to it

108
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,540
然后让我妹妹推我去街上
and made my sister push me up and down the block

109
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,910
讨糖吃
to trick or treat.

110
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,770
星球大战里的机器人
大部分人都以为我在扮R2-D2
Granted most people thought I was R2-D2,

111
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,100
但我还是讨到很多糖
but still, I got a lot of candy.

112
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,630
你好像不太懂
You don't seem to be understanding

113
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,230
英语的"NO"
the English word "no."

114
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,430
或者换其他语言比较好
Maybe a different language will help.

115
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,600
俄语  Nyet
Russian: <i>nyet.</i>

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,260
中文  不
Chinese: <i>bu.</i>

117
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,910
日语  いいえ
Japanese: <i>iie.</i>

118
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,740
克林贡语  qo'
Klingon: <i>qo'.</i>

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,220
二进制ASCII码  0110111001101111
Binary coded Ascii:0110111001101111.

120
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,970
-应该是01100111  -不行
- It's actually 01100111. - No!

121
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,070
我不是为自己求你
I'm not asking for me,

122
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
我是为了霍金求你
I'm asking for Hawking.

123
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,550
试试黑帮用语  去你丫的
Let me try gangsta: Hells naw.

124
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,780
好吧  要不这样
Okay, look, how about this?

125
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,380
把我的希格斯粒子论文给他
Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson.

126
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,240
如果他看出我所做的伟大突破
If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made,

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,630
他会主动联系我
he'll reach out to me.

128
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
要是他不联系你呢
What if he doesn't?

129
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,500
他会的  他可聪明了
He will; he's really smart.

130
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,760
这个主意有意思
That's an interesting idea.

131
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,380
要不你给我几分钟
Why don't you give me a minute

132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,110
让我跟我的朋友商量一下
to talk it over with my friends?

133
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,410
-我要怎么做  -赶紧消失
- How do I do that? - You walk away.

134
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,400
我这就闪
Walking away.

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,990
你要知道  你现在就是他的老大
You do realize you own his ass right now.

136
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,170
我知道
I do.

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
你可以把他当狗使唤
You can make him do anything you want.

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,680
我知道  我只是在想
Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,910
我要把他整得多惨
how much I want to punish him.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,660
别太过分  意思一下
Well, don't be too mean.

141
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,480
伙计们
Hey, fellas,

142
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,840
我想泡点清新冰茶
I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea

143
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
有谁想喝呀
if anyone would like some.

144
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,180
我不介意来一杯
I wouldn't mind a glass.

145
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,100
我没跟你说话
I wasn't talking to you.

146
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,960
整到他求爷爷告奶奶
Bring him to his bony knees.

147
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,650
小谢子  回来吧
Sheldon, come on back.

148
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,760
来了  来了
Yes, yes.

149
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,460
您意下如何
What did you decide?

150
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,530
我可以把你的论文给霍金教授
I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.

151
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,500
太好了  谢谢
Great, thank you!

152
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,690
真是太好了
Oh, that's terrific!

153
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,870
但是  你要为我做几件事作为交换
But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.

154
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,610
什么事
What kinds of things?

155
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,200
希腊神话中  赫拉因错杀自己孩子而受诅咒
为消除罪业  他要为敌人完成十二项任务
你听说过赫拉克勒斯的十二伟业吗
Are you familiar with the 12 labors of Hercules?

156
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,450
当然
Of course.

157
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,790
那你走运了
You should be so lucky.

158
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,720
好了
All right.

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
你要我先做什么
What would you like me to do first?

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,330
我觉得我就先让你
Well, I thought I'd start you off

161
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,360
给我擦皮带扣吧
by polishing my belt buckles.

162
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,550
没问题
By all means.

163
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,020
小时候  我会帮我奶奶擦银器
When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

164
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,140
她就会给我讲
And she would entertain me with stories

165
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,740
她在俄州长大的故事
about growing up in Oklahoma.

166
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,040
有趣的女人
Interesting woman.

167
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,330
有一次  她用肉汁盘子打死了一只土拨鼠
She once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.

168
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,420
真厉害
That's nice.

169
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,880
好多皮带扣啊
That's a lot of belt buckles.

170
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,200
有趣的是  我只有一条皮带
Funny thing is,I only have one belt.

171
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,230
好了  我不妨碍你开工了
Anyway, I'll let you get started.

172
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,240
顺便说一下
Oh, by the way,

173
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
上面可能有些看似水渍的点
the little marks, uh,that look like water spots--

174
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,660
我小便时习惯靠便盆太近  所以
I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so...

175
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,610
你看到的那些是溅回来的
...what you're seeing there is splash back.

176
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,180
你把尿尿在皮带扣上吗
You make sissy on your belt buckles?

177
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,110
奶奶的叉子上绝对没有
Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

178
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,120
给你个紫外光灯照尿渍吧
Here is a black light to check them.

179
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,380
再给你提个醒
And for your own peace of mind,

180
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,800
紫外光灯还可以识别能够发出自然荧光的精液和其他体液
最好不要用它来照我的房间哦
you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.

181
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,340
谢尔顿  擦得好干净啊
Sheldon, these look great.

182
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,040
它们就像华丽的小皇冠
They're like magnificent little crowns

183
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,080
挂在我坚挺的小宝贝上
to hang over my magnificent little jewels.

184
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,600
你怎么擦得这么亮
How'd you get them so shiny?

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,470
我给它们上了一层防水蜡
Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax.

186
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,540
汽车用品店里的伙计说
The man down at Pep Boys says from now on,

187
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,330
以后溅上去的尿液会直接流下去
the urine should just bead up and roll right off.

188
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,750
干得漂亮
Way to go the extra mile.

189
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,260
你奶奶会骄傲的
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

190
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,230
我奶奶绝对不可以知道这件事
My Mee-Maw must never know of this.

191
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,160
现在能把我的论文给霍金教授看了吧
Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,660
小乖乖  当然不可以
Oh, my dear boy, no.

193
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,850
好了
Okay.

194
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
接下来
Next,

195
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,140
这是我买给伯纳黛特的
this is a sexy French maid costume

196
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,400
性感法国女佣装
I bought for Bernadette.

197
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,180
我原以为这既能增加情趣
I thought it might spice things up

198
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,450
又能让她帮我打扫房间
and get her to dust my room at the same time,

199
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,120
可我错了  大错特错
but I was wrong and really wrong.

200
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,780
所以你想让我把它退回去吗
And you want me to return it for you?

201
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,710
不  不  不  我的小可爱[法语]
No, no, no, mon petit cherie.

202
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,190
你们看什么看
What are you all staring at?

203
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,760
没见过为了见斯蒂芬·霍金
You ever seen a man try to get a meeting

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,890
牺牲色相的男人吗
with Stephen Hawking before?

205
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,430
今天不是周六呀
It's not Saturday night.

206
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,320
你怎么跑来洗衣服了
Why are you doing your laundry?

207
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,160
这不是我的衣服
This is not my laundry.

208
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,910
这是艾米的吗
Wow, are these Amy's?

209
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,330
挺狂野的  不错不错
Kind of trashy -- good for her.

210
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,510
那是霍华德的
Those are Howard's.

211
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,950
你为什么要替霍华德
Why are you washing

212
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,410
洗他的男士小内内呢
Howard's man panties?

213
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,460
因为要是我不洗的话
Because if I don't,

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,320
他就不把我的论文拿给斯蒂芬·霍金看
he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking.

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,060
斯蒂芬·霍金是个著名的物理学家
He's a famous physicist.

216
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,950
我知道  那个坐着轮椅发明了时间的家伙
I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.

217
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,030
差不多吧
That's close enough.

218
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,610
我不懂
I don't understand,

219
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,900
为什么霍华德不直接把你介绍给那人呢
why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?

220
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,280
他要惩罚我这个"傲慢的混蛋"
Because he's punishing me for being a "condescending jerk".

221
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,980
你不会也觉得我傲慢吧
You don't think I'm condescending, do you?

222
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,440
有点吧
Well, kind of...

223
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,710
抱歉  "傲慢"的意思是...
Oh, I'm sorry,condescending means...

224
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,750
我懂好不好
I know what it means.

225
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,740
没错  你超喜欢纠正别人
And yes, you love correcting people

226
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,950
让人自惭形秽
and putting them down.

227
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,190
正相反
Au contraire.

228
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,320
当我纠正别人时  我是让他们更进一步
When I correct people I am raising them up.

229
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,650
你应该最懂了  你可是深得我恩惠
You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.

230
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,130
拜托  你只是给自己带来优越感
Come on, you do it to feel superior.

231
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,330
每次有人犯语法错误
I see that twinkle in your eye

232
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,600
或是把月亮当作行星时
when someone says "who" instead of "whom"

233
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
我都能看到你两眼放光
or thinks the moon is a planet.

234
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,910
《堂·吉诃德》Don Quixote  音似驴子诃德Donkey Hotay
或是有人以为《堂·吉诃德》是在写驴子诃德
Or <i>Don Quixote</i> is a book about a donkey named Hotay.

235
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,010
看见没
See, there it is,

236
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,660
你两眼又放光了
there's that twinkle.

237
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,220
没办法  我完全是下意识两眼放光
Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.

238
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,870
那你想我怎么说  谢尔顿
What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?

239
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,010
我想听你说
I want you to tell me

240
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,490
霍华德就是想无故欺负我
that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.

241
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,890
好吧  霍华德就是想无故欺负你
Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.

242
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,490
我就知道
I knew it.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
怎么了
What's the matter?

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
我每次在你家过夜
Every time I spend the night,

245
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,910
你妈都会拍我屁股  说"妹子  上吧"
your mom slaps me on the behind says, "Go get 'em."

246
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,780
这不能怪她
It's not her fault.

247
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,450
她正在接受激素替代疗法
She's getting hormone replacement therapy.

248
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,980
导致她相当饥渴
Makes her crazy horny.

249
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,470
看  我让谢尔顿穿那套法国女佣装哦
Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the Frenchmaid's costume.

250
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,510
天啊  这也太过分了吧
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

251
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,890
拜托  是你穿过一次说不要的
Hey, I gave you first crack at it.

252
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,360
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing that?

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,740
你这是在欺负他
You're being mean to him.

254
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,330
是他整天欺负我
He's mean to me all the time.

255
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,970
你也见过他取笑我没有博士学位
You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.

256
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,410
如果你不想没博士学位被人取笑
If you don't want to get teased about that,

257
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,890
那就去考一个呀
get a doctorate.

258
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,270
我有一个  感觉超棒呢
I have one; they're great.

259
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,810
拜托  这个家伙一直在折磨我
Oh, come on, the man torments me.

260
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,520
我只不过用其人之道还治其人之身而已
I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.

261
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,120
这不一样
It's not the same thing.

262
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
谢尔顿意识不到自己的刻薄
Sheldon doesn't know when he's being mean

263
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,620
因为他控制这部分情感的大脑
because the part of his brain that should know

264
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,370
被大脑其它部分给挤扁了
is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.

265
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,540
好吧  我让他再多干几件事
Fine, I'll just make him do a couple more things,

266
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,680
就收手
then I'll stop.

267
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,620
不  你现在就得收手
No, you have to stop now.

268
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,580
伯纳黛特  提醒你一下
Bernadette, I want to remind you,

269
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,440
你答应过明天陪我去买裙子的哦
you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!

270
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,290
该死
Oh, damn.

271
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,890
对不起  我明天有事去不了了
I'm sorry, I can't make it,

272
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,330
但是谢尔顿会陪你去的
but Sheldon's going to go with you!

273
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,030
这是你让他做的最后一件事了
And that's the last thing you do to him.

274
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,010
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

275
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,870
帮我一下
I need your help!

276
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,390
又怎么了  沃罗威茨太太
What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

277
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,870
这裙子有问题
It's this dress!

278
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,680
我把胸塞进去  屁股就露出来了
When I put my front in, my back pops out!

279
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,510
我把屁股塞进去  胸就又露出来了
When I put my back in,my front pops out!

280
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,490
简直是一山容不下二虎呀
It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!

281
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,190
你想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

282
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,750
我们应该携手合作
We're gonna have to work as a team!

283
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,640
进来  大把抓着  动手塞啊
Get in here, grab a handful,and start stuffing!

284
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,820
我不太确定该怎么做呢
I'm not sure how to do this.

285
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,180
很简单  就像把用完的睡袋给塞回去
It's easy, just pretend you're putting away a sleeping bag.

286
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,470
睡袋不会出这么多汗  不过好吧
Sleeping bags don't usually sweat this much, but okay.

287
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
帮我拉上拉链
Now zip me up.

288
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,460
再继续挤下去
Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter,

289
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,340
钻石的形成需要高压推挤
你就能变成钻石了
you may turn into a diamond.

290
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,710
你说得对  我骗谁呢
You're right, who am I kidding?

291
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,940
你真该见见我年轻的时候  谢尔顿
You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon.

292
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,100
追我的小伙们
The fellas used to line up

293
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,640
排着队给我送糖
and bring me boxes of candy.

294
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,910
我干嘛嘴贱全吃光啊
Why did I eat it all?!

295
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,010
可以抱我一下吗
Would you hold me?

296
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,350
我  我不是那种会抱别人的...
Oh... no, you know, I'm not really the holding kind of...

297
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,190
哦  差点忘了
Oh, guys, I just remembered.

298
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,590
我给你们带了几个霍金纪念品
I got your ome Hawking souvenirs.

299
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,860
是什么
What are these?

300
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,960
他轮椅上的齿轮和弹簧
Gears and springs from his wheelchair.

301
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,230
酷吧
Pretty cool, huh?

302
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,850
太棒了
Wow, that's amazing.

303
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,270
我给他的轮椅制动机做了调整
I made an adjustment on the motor drive

304
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,470
之后要装回去时
and when I was putting it back together

305
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,590
却想不起这几个零件是装哪的了
I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.

306
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,310
我做到了
I did it.

307
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,620
跑了整整三个服装店
Had to go to three clothing stores,

308
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,470
总算找到一件能"装"进你妈的衣服了
but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.

309
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,420
我应该提醒你
I should have sent you

310
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,060
去阿尔塔迪纳的特制车罩店去买的
to the custom car cover place in Altadena.

311
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,170
他们有我妈的资料
They have her pattern on file.

312
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,650
真幽默
Humorous.

313
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,540
现在能把我的论文给霍金教授看了吧
Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?

314
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,560
我不知道
I don't know.

315
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,940
老天啊
Oh, for heaven's sake.

316
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,630
衣服帮你洗了  你的皮带扣还上了防尿层
I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles,

317
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,460
我为了帮你妈抬高胸部
I, I even sprained my wrist

318
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,440
我还把手腕扭伤了
helping your mother lift her bosom.

319
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,850
好了  谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon,

320
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,390
你再帮我做最后一个任务
there's only one thing left I want you to do.

321
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,090
别担心  这个超简单
Don't worry, it's an easy one.

322
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,460
好吧
Okay.

323
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,630
夸夸我
Give me a compliment.

324
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,590
好吧
Fine.

325
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,560
你的手超小
You have very tiny hands.

326
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,330
不  是夸我的工作
No... about my job.

327
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,930
夸我工作干得出色
I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.

328
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,420
你明显干得很出色啊
You're obviously good at what you do.

329
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,380
那你为什么老是挖苦我
Well, then why are you always ripping on me?

330
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,550
我理解你的困惑
Oh, I understand the confusion.

331
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,650
我从未说过你工作不称职
I have never said that you are not good at what you do.

332
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,390
我是说你的工作没价值
It's just that what you do is not worth doing.

333
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,060
这话可比他对我说的好听多了
It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me.

334
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,500
要我一定会接受
I'd take it and run.

335
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,160
谢谢你  谢尔顿
Thank you, Sheldon.

336
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
现在能把我的论文给霍金看了吧
Now will you give my paper to Hawking?

337
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,570
抱歉  不能
Sorry, I can't.

338
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,640
什么  为什么
What, why not?

339
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,840
我三天前就给他了
I gave it to him three days ago.

340
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,140
他说了那论文很棒
He was really impressed.

341
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,820
他想见你
He wants to meet you.

342
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,140
那好吧
All right, then.

343
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,250
谢谢你  霍华德
Thank you, Howard.

344
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,460
请你转告霍金教授
Please let Professor Hawking know

345
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,290
他什么时间想见我  我都有空
that I'm available at his earliest convenience.

346
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,160
我还以为他会更兴奋呢
I thought he might be a little more excited.

347
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
稍安勿躁
Give it a second.

348
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,470
霍金教授
Professor Hawking,

349
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,000
能见到您真是太荣幸了  先生
it's an honor and a privilege to meet you, sir.

350
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,180
我知道
I know.

351
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,040
感谢您抽出时间见我
I want to thank you for taking time to see me.

352
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,800
我的荣幸
My pleasure.

353
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,920
我很喜欢你的论文
I enjoyed reading your paper very much.

354
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,810
你的确是聪明绝顶
You clearly have a brilliant mind.

355
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,150
我知道
I know.

356
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,250
你那关于希格斯玻色子是个黑洞
Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole

357
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,570
且能加速时间反演的理论很厉害
accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.

358
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,070
谢谢
Thank you.

359
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,560
是我有天早上洗澡时突然想到的
It just-- it came to me one morning in the shower.

360
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,220
挺好啊
That's nice.

361
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,380
可惜是错误的
Too bad it's wrong.

362
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,720
你什么意思
What do you mean wrong?

363
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,820
第二页上有地方运算错误了
You made an arithmetic mistake on page two.

364
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,000
愚蠢的错误
It was quite the boner.

365
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,430
不  那不可能
No, no... that can't be right.

366
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,790
我不可能会运算错误啊
I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes.

367
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,790
那你是说我有吗
Are you saying I do?

368
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,720
不是
Oh, no,

369
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,150
当然不是
no, no, of course not.

370
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,510
我只是在想
It's just, I was thinking...

371
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,270
天哪  我真的错了
Oh, gosh, golly,I made a boo-boo,

372
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,960
我还把它呈给了史蒂芬·霍金
and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.

373
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,340
老天  又一个晕倒粉
Great, another fainter.
