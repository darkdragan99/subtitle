1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,940
这周末你想不想
Hey, want to spend some time

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,680
一起玩星球大战的新游戏
playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,530
我说不准
Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,960
我答应过自己要远离电脑
I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,750
多点锻炼身体  多做些运动...
be more physically active. Get some exercise...

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,170
你马上要爬三层楼梯了
You're about to walk up three flights of stairs.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,990
说得好  算我一个
Good point, I'm in.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,330
我有个更好的主意
You know what would be great?

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,040
咱们像以前那样玩一把
Let's do it like the old days.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,900
你是说游戏马拉松吗
You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,720
没错  从周六早上开始
Yeah. Start Saturday morning,

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,080
连玩四十八个小时
go 48 hours,

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,010
带上睡袋  垃圾食品
sleeping bags, junk food...

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,950
关掉手机  避免老妈骚扰
Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,190
就像几年前咱们玩魔兽世界那样
It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,490
最后邻居都报警了
when the neighbors called the cops on us.

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,040
他们打电话报警是因为受不了恶臭
They called the cops because of the smell.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
人家还以为咱们死翘翘了呢
They thought we were dead.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,910
那时的我们真是坏小子呀
We were badass back in the day.

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,420
好吧  就这么定了
All right, let's do it.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,510
《星球大战：旧共和国》游戏背景设定在共和国军对抗帝国军的奥德兰内战时期
星球大战  四十八小时不停战
48 hours of Star Wars gaming.

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,800
在电影中奥德兰星球被帝国的超级兵器死星炸成碎片
开战吧  就像在奥德兰战区那样
It's on like Alderaan.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,740
谢尔顿  取消你周末的行程
Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,530
星球大战马拉松  周六上午正式开始
Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars marathon.

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,160
是看电影还是打电动
Movies or video games?

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,060
不  是桌游吗
No, board game?

27
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,300
还是集换式卡牌游戏
Or trading card games?

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,860
或是乐高  或是角色扮演
Or Lego's? Or dress up?

29
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,800
又或是看漫画书
Or comic books?!

30
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,710
难道是绘声绘色地朗读电影小说吗
Or dramatic readings of Novelizations?!

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,200
我都参加
Yes to all!

32
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,700
我们准备玩网游
We are going to play the online game.

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,370
网游
The online game?!

34
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,520
更妙
Bully!

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,040
先生们  虽然谢尔顿肯定非常喜欢
Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy

36
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,730
跟你们一起玩星际间的虚拟游戏
playing intergalactic make-believe,

37
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,970
但我们俩已经另有安排了
he and I have other plans.

38
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,090
我们要去参加弗罗拉姨妈的九十三岁生日派对
We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,510
你就跟她说我有事去不了了嘛
Just tell her I can't come.

40
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,920
如果我们不去  她会很失望的
She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,220
她都九十三岁了
She's 93.

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,480
也失望不了几年了
She won't be disappointed for very long.

43
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,580
不  你等会  我可是遵守了
No, hang on. I followed all the protocols

44
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,850
恋爱协议里你制定的所有规定
set forth by you in the relationship agreement.

45
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,940
我提前七十二个小时提交了书面申请
I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.

46
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,900
我检查了车的胎压
I checked the tire pressure on the car.

47
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,590
我甚至还联系了疾病控制中心  问他们
I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out

48
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,360
去橘子郡旅游要打什么疫苗
what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.

49
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,840
顺便说一声  什么疫苗都不用打
FYI, it's none.

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,600
艾米  恋爱协议制订的初衷可不是为了
Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed

51
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,850
给咱俩任何一方行方便
for either one of us to get our way.

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,740
你就拿它来给自己行方便了呀
You use it to get your way.

53
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,960
我是拿它来做该做的事
I use it to get the right way.

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,490
事实证明  该做的事就是给我自己行方便
The fact that the right way is also my way

55
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,240
这真是个美妙的巧合
is a happy coincidence.

56
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,500
你都答应我了
You gave me your word.

57
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,020
你就要跟我去
You're coming with me.

58
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,530
我们会想你的  谢尔顿
We'll miss you, Sheldon.

59
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,900
好吧
Yeah, well,

60
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,400
谁会想把整个周末浪费
who wants to spend the whole weekend,

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,950
在一堆假想星球上跑来跑去
running around a bunch of pretend planets

62
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,490
跟不存在的怪兽打来打去呀
battling made up monsters.

63
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,140
小孩才这样呢
That's for babies.

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,480
话是没错  可这游戏有光剑呢
Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

65
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,380
求求你了  艾米  这个游戏有光剑呢
Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabers!

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,170
生活大爆炸第五季第十九集

67
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,500
你好  斯图尔特
Hello, Stewart.

68
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,590
你好  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

69
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,760
有什么需要帮忙的吗
Help you with anything?

70
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,420
有  我这周末要去参加一个
Yes, I'm attending a party this weekend

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,630
九十三岁老太太的生日派对
for a 93-year-old woman.

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,530
你能推荐份礼物吗
Can you recommend a gift?

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,120
我也不知道
Uh, I don't know.

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,460
在亚瑟王神剑的末端弄个网球
Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur.

75
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,010
一根酷到爆的拐杖就诞生了
Make a pretty badass cane.

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,080
-那你这卖网球吗  -不卖
- Do you supply the tennis ball?  - No.

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,260
那算了
Then no.

78
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,340
还有什么
What else?

79
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,390
珍藏版的蝙蝠侠多功能腰带
Oh, have this collectors edition batman utility belt.

80
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,090
也许她可以把这个系在身上当药罐
Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.

81
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,540
她要是不穿一整套的话
Well, she'd just look silly wearing that

82
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,700
光系腰带会显得很傻
without the rest of the costume.

83
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,360
抱歉  谢尔顿  没了  我江郎才尽了
I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.

84
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,700
这不是你的错
Oh, it's not your fault.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,290
我已经去过模型火车店
I've been to the model train store.

86
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,730
无线电商店
I've been to Radio Shack.

87
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,250
这老太太的礼物可真难买
This woman is impossible to shop for.

88
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,280
要不是谢尔顿搞得到女人太让我震惊
I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,040
我早就开始取笑他连女人都搞不定了
if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.

90
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,790
没事  莱纳德  你尽管取笑我吧
No, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

91
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,280
就像我父亲常说的
Like my daddy always said,

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,690
"谢利  唯女子与小人难养也"
"Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom."

93
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,890
你父亲是这么说话的吗
That's what your father used to say?

94
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,380
我自动把脏话和语助词去掉
Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw,

95
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,970
但大意不变
but you get the gist.

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,660
如果你不想去参加派对的话  就别去
Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go.

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,080
你是个成年人
You're a grown man.

98
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
就得有成年人的样子
Act like one.

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,430
跟艾米说  你想这周末不回家
Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover

100
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,710
跟你的朋友们一起玩游戏
and playing video games with your friends.

101
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,600
没准她还会喜欢你这样呢
Maybe she'll dig it.

102
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,270
女人就喜欢立场坚定的男人[直译为坚定的掌舵手]
Women like a firm hand on the tiller.

103
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,510
我连舵[阴蒂]在哪都找不到
I can never find the tiller.

104
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,660
我还有本教学书呢  还是于事无补
I got a book; it didn't help.

105
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,460
是啊  我以前总是想如果朝一日我沦为奴隶
Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved,

106
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,040
那肯定是被另一个星球的高级物种奴役
it would be by an advanced species from another planet,

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,530
而不是某个来自格兰岱尔市的小妞
not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

108
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,800
我下载了一个应用程序
Now, I downloaded an app that

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
没准对现在的情况会有帮助哦
might be helpful in this situation.

110
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,460
你说得没错
You're right.

111
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,710
我这么聪明
I'm smart as a whip.
whip一词多义  有鞭子和聪明的意思

112
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,180
肯定能找到解决办法的
I should be able to figure this out.

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,700
话说我这周末
Hey, listen, I kind of made plans

114
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,870
打算跟他们几个玩  不过后来我想
with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered,

115
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,950
我们正处在恋爱测试阶段
because we're in this relationship-beta-test,

116
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,310
我是不是应该先问问你的意见
if I should have asked you first.

117
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,980
接着我又想  如果我真的先问你
Then I thought if I did check with you first,

118
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,920
你又可能觉得我对这段感情太认真了
then you'd think that I was taking things to seriously.

119
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,230
再后来  我就流鼻血了
And then-en I got a nosebleed.

120
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,740
你不用事事都先问我
You don't have to check with me.

121
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,220
你想干什么就干什么
Do whatever you want.

122
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,840
这不是我期待的反应  不过没关系
I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.

123
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,880
是吗  那你期待的是什么反应
Really, what were you hoping for?

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,900
我也不知道
I don't know,

125
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,290
或许你会小小地生气一下
maybe that you'd be a little upset,

126
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,790
然后意识到
and then you'd realize that

127
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,300
我是一匹向往自由的骏马
I'm a stallion that has to run free.

128
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
这点会让你小小地性奋一下
And that would turn you on a little.

129
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,610
行  我是个演员  再问我一遍
Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.

130
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,630
你介意我这个周末
Do you mind if I spend the weekend

131
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,390
跟他们几个玩网游吗
playing video games with the guys?

132
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,140
什么  整个周末
Wha... the entire weekend?

133
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,930
那我岂不是见不到你了
You mean I wouldn't see you at all?

134
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,820
可我...
But I j...

135
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,730
算了
No, no...

136
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,940
当初爱上你时我就知道了
I knew what I was getting into.

137
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,080
莱纳德这匹骏马是拴不住的
You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter.

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,230
哎哟  屋子里好像变热了
Oh, my, is it getting hot in here?

139
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,850
源于西班牙语  用于调情
是么  宝贝
Ay, papi.

140
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,080
是么  宝贝
Ay, papi?

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,250
这是什么呀
What is that?

142
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,300
演技大发挥
An acting choice.

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,680
这么说每次你性奋的时候
So you chose that when you become turned on,

144
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,410
墨西哥动画片《飞毛腿冈萨雷斯》
你就会变成飞毛鼠咯
you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?

145
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,180
你有意见吗  宝贝
Choo got a problem with that, papi?

146
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,500
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny! Penny! Penny!

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,940
不好意思  骏马
Sorry, Stallion.

148
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,160
你的长颈鹿疯友来了
Your weird friend Giraffe is here.

149
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,550
你好  佩妮
Hello, Penny!

150
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,540
我是过来送你礼物的
I just stopped by to bring you this gift.

151
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,200
小熊软糖  谢谢
Gummy bears? Thank you.

152
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,160
拿人家的手软  吃人家的嘴短
Now that you're in my debt...

153
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,890
麻烦你在艾米耳边吹吹风
...please manipulate Amy into releasing me

154
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,220
别让我去参加她姨妈的无聊生日派对
from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.

155
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,160
不可能
Not a chance.

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,330
好吧
All right.

157
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,880
我早料到软糖可能使不动你
I thought the candy might not be enough

158
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,660
那我提高价码吧
so let me up the ante.

159
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,490
这有几张库珀礼券
These are Cooper Coupons.

160
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,450
可以让我为你做各种事
These are for various things I can do for you.

161
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,640
比如这张
Um, oh, this one

162
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,550
可提供一次免费的语法检查
is for one free grammar check.

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,780
我可以帮你检查电邮  信件
You could use it for emails, letters,

164
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,510
纹身等等  诸如此类的东西
tattoos, what have you.

165
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,680
这张可有趣了
Oh, this is fun one!

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,500
用这张可以跟我在加州科学中心共度下午
This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center,

167
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,900
我会现场指出他们的错误
where I point out their mistakes.

168
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,140
注意一下使用期限
Keep an eye on those expiration dates,

169
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,170
我就被骗过不止一次
I've been burned more than once.

170
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,960
够了  亲爱的  我绝对不会
All right, sweetie, I'm not going to get involved

171
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,110
干预你们的恋情
in your relationship.

172
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,300
拜托  不就是帮个忙嘛
Oh, come on. It's just a simple favor.

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,520
我上一次叫你帮我做事
Now, when's the last time I asked you

174
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,070
是什么时候
to do something for me?

175
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,620
昨天  你要我帮你看看
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear

176
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,800
你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

177
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,430
我上一次叫你帮我做非紧急医疗的事
When is the last time I asked you to do something

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,330
是什么时候
that wasn't a medical emergency?

179
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,680
昨天  你要我帮你看看
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear

180
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,890
你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

181
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,570
好吧  我别无选择
All right, then, I have no choice

182
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,270
只有执行B计划了
but to go on to plan B.

183
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,950
什么B计划
What's that?

184
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,830
我准备湿着头
I'm going to run around outside

185
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,940
去外面跑一圈  看看能不能感冒
with a wet head and try to catch a cold.

186
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,680
早上好
Good morning.

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,860
早上好
Hello.

188
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,740
我觉得你今天会玩得很开心的
I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today.

189
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,630
你不但能见到我的亲戚
Not only do you get to meet my relatives,

190
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,860
而且因为我姨妈的派对是疗养院承办的
but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party,

191
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,430
所以所有的食品都软绵绵的
all of the food is incredibly soft.

192
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,310
就像给你的牙齿放假一样
It's like a vacation for your teeth.

193
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,000
好的
All right.

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
你确定你想去吗
You sure you're okay with this?

195
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,030
确定
Yes.

196
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,740
我决定找一个
I decided to find a way

197
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,440
即能出席派对又能玩得开心的方法
that I could have this experience and enjoy it.

198
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,660
谢谢  这对我来说意义重大
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

199
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,010
不用谢我
Oh, don't thank me.

200
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,820
要谢就谢无线技术
Thank wireless technology.

201
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,970
我发现即使出席你姨妈的无聊派对
I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party

202
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,660
也一样能跟朋友们玩网游一整天
and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.

203
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,610
谢尔顿  我的亲戚都想跟你聊聊
Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you,

204
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,760
而你却打算坐在一旁玩游戏吗
and you're going to be sitting there playing a game?

205
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,520
这未免太无礼了吧
Isn't that a little rude?

206
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,510
你放心  我有办法
Oh, I got that covered.

207
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,220
耳麦
Headset.

208
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,670
那些老家伙在说什么  我一个字都听不到
I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.

209
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,320
既然你觉得玩游戏比
You know, if playing that game is more important to you

210
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,550
履行你对我的承诺还重要
than honoring your commitment to me,

211
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,130
你也不介意我告诉大家我要带男友出席
and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself

212
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,340
结果却孤家寡人现身在派对上的话
after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody,

213
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,940
那我没话说
then, fine.

214
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,580
你回家去玩游戏吧
Go home and play your game.

215
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,090
谢谢
Thanks.

216
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,100
对了
Ooh, listen,

217
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,110
我不介意你带一块生日蛋糕给我
I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake,

218
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,840
前提是老家伙吹蜡烛时口水没飙出来
provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.

219
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,390
东西齐了
Here you go.

220
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,190
我买了游戏期间我们需要的所有东西
I've got everything we'll need for the big game:

221
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,330
低脂火鸡肉干
low-fat turkey jerky...

222
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,530
低碳水化合物啤酒
low-carb beer...

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,020
只有一百卡路里的零食
100-calorie snack pack...

224
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,420
你买东西的时候   有顺便买条Y染色体吗
You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there?
男性染色体为XY  女人染性体为XX
缺乏Y染色体可能导致发育为娘娘腔

225
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,010
你也可能是没有Y染色体吧
You might be short one.

226
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,810
我是要在游戏里升级
Hey, I plan on leveling up in the game,

227
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,580
不是要升级我的泳衣尺码  真谢谢你了
not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.

228
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,120
先生们  游戏给我们提供了选择
Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice,

229
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,050
是选正义使者银河共和国呢
between playing for the Republic and the light side,

230
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,140
还是选大反派西斯帝国呢
or the Sith Empire and the dark side.

231
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,510
我们向来选做正义使者
Well, we're always the good guys.

232
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,880
在《龙与地下城》  咱是善良守法
In D&D, we're lawful good,

233
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
在《英雄之城》里  我们是英雄
in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes,

234
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,980
在《侠盗猎车手》
and Grand Theft Auto,

235
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,560
我们完事后立马付钱给妓女
we pay the prostitutes promptly,

236
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,310
还从不用球棒打她们
and never hit them with a bat.

237
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,800
是妓女啊
Those women are prostitutes?

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
你说她们是在为干细胞研究募资
You said they were raising money for stem cell research.

239
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,710
伙计们  我有惊喜要给大家哦
Hey, guys, I got a surprise.

240
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,440
如果是帮助女性肠胃运动的酸奶
Hm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies poop,

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
我觉得拉杰已经捷足先登了
I think Raj beat you to it.

242
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,480
不是  伯纳黛特要跟我们一起玩
No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us.

243
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,840
很不错吧  对吧  那是当然
So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.

244
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,810
什么  你邀请了你的女友
What, you invited your girlfriend?!

245
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,100
这可是我们的男生周末
This is supposed to be our weekend!

246
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
我也没办法  昨晚她说
I had no choice. Last night, she said,

247
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,450
我们明天一起吃早午餐吧
"Why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow

248
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,720
然后再去植物园
and then maybe the Arboretum."

249
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,820
我说  不行
And I said, "Well, no,

250
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,880
我答应他们几个
I promised the guys I was going to

251
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
周末一起玩游戏的
play a video game with them all weekend."

252
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,470
然后她说  听起来挺好玩的
And she said, "That sounds like fun.

253
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,180
我能加入吗
Can I come, too?"

254
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,230
我沉默了一会儿  然后她说
And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said,

255
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,550
你是不想让我一起吗
"Well, do you not want me to come?"

256
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,110
然后我就给她买了个新笔记本和一套游戏
And then I bought her a new laptop and the game,

257
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,930
然后她现在正在停车呢
and she's parking the car right now.

258
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,910
鞭子抽男人的程序
Is the whip sound app

259
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,560
符合此情此景吗
contextually appropriate here?

260
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,040
可以  但我觉得你等得有点久
Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long

261
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,740
笑点都过去了
for it to be funny.

262
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,960
我说错了  还是很搞笑
I was wrong; it's still funny.

263
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,210
太好了
Oh, good.

264
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,920
艾米  怎么了
Amy, what's wrong?

265
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,660
我男友是个混球
My boyfriend's a jerk.

266
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,330
好吧  他肯定不是劈腿
Well, I know he didn't cheat on you,

267
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,750
那是什么事
so what happened?

268
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
我孤家寡人参加我姨妈的派对
I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself,

269
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,090
人人都嘲弄我说
and everybody was like,

270
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,680
"你那个总挂在嘴边的男朋友呢"
"Where's this boyfriend you're always talking about?

271
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
"是真有其人  还是你编出来的呀"
"Is he real, or did you make him up like Armen,

272
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,340
比如之前那个小马农阿曼"
the miniature horse breeder?"

273
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,980
谁是小马农阿曼
Who's Armen the miniature horse breeder?

274
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,390
是我为了摆脱家人唠叨  而捏造出来的男友
The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back.

275
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,370
但很快就被揭穿了  因为我答不上来
It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer the question

276
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,910
"你俩怎么认识的"
"How'd you two meet?"

277
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,600
要是我  我会说是在一场小马秀上
I would have thought at a miniature horse show.

278
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,920
这答案不错
Oh, that's good.

279
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,220
我慌了神  便说是在伍德斯托克音乐节
I panicked and said Woodstock.

280
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,390
我只是想在我家人面前炫耀一下谢尔顿
I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.

281
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,920
当然啦  我懂的
Sure, I get that.

282
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,860
他是你的初恋男友嘛
I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.

283
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,070
他不仅是我初恋男友  还是最好的男友
Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend.

284
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,910
你想想
I mean, think about it.

285
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,170
我在跟谢尔顿·库珀交往哎
I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.

286
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,630
没错
Yes.

287
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,060
还别有用心
On purpose.

288
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,130
他帅气十足  身材修长
He's handsome, he's lanky,

289
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,660
才华横溢
he's brilliant,

290
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,600
而且他的皮肤苍白无血色
and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.

291
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,320
吸血鬼式的病态肤色的确是新性感指标
Well, sickly is the new sexy.

292
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,480
没错
Yeah.

293
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,020
艾米
You know, Amy,

294
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,140
有时候  当你跟你真正喜欢的人
sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone

295
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,430
谈恋爱时  不好的地方是
you really care about, the sucky part is,

296
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,390
会让你更容易受伤
it leaves you open to getting hurt.

297
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,080
你担心过莱纳德这么对你吗
Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?

298
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,470
问得真搞笑  从来没有
That's hilarious. No.

299
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,580
干掉他  干掉他
Get that guy! Get that guy!

300
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,280
罗斯坦考夫斯基博士
Dr. Rostenkowski,

301
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,730
要知道
it may interest you to know

302
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,560
你这样瞎喊还不如
that saying "Pew, pew, pew" isn't as effective

303
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,950
直接按爆炸键有效
as pressing your blaster key.

304
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,820
同样  再怎么乱叫
In the same way that saying "Whee!"

305
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,130
陆行艇也不会跑起来
doesn't make the land speeder go.

306
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,600
拉杰  帝国军队接近你了
Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.

307
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,250
搞定了
Got him.

308
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,170
当甘地提倡他的非暴力理论时
When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence,

309
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,180
他肯定不明白打打杀杀有多痛快
I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.

310
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,630
好了  我们把他们全杀光了
All right, I think we got them all.

311
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,140
分战利品吧
Let's divide up the loot.

312
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,860
看我拿到的这件漂亮的紫色长袍
Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got.

313
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,210
你也该穿上你的  咱俩多搭呀
You should put on yours and then we'll match.

314
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,790
我费了好大劲才得到这身盔甲
But I worked hard to get this armor.

315
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,400
抱歉  我只是觉得
Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice

316
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,530
让别人看出咱俩是一对很有爱
if people knew we were a couple.

317
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,740
好吧  我换
Fine, I'll change.

318
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,600
-我不想玩游戏  -拜托
- I don't think I want to play a game. - Oh, come on!

319
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,900
他们在对门玩得不亦乐乎  咱也该玩玩
They're playing one across the hall-- we should, too.

320
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,090
好了  我们轮流往桌子上扔硬币
Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter

321
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,050
如果谁把它弹到这个杯子里
off the table, and if it goes into this cup,

322
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,510
另一个人就得喝一杯
the other person has to drink.

323
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,020
然后你再继续
Then you get to go again...

324
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,190
像这样吗
Like that?

325
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,510
没错  新手运气好而已
Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck.

326
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,240
现在呢  我把这一整杯啤酒喝掉
So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer,

327
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,190
然后你再继续
and you will go again...

328
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,300
好吧
All right.

329
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,170
现在我就喝光这杯酒
So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup

330
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,660
然后再喝掉一杯
and then I'm going to drink another one.

331
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,740
行了  说真的  住手  搞毛啊
Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?

332
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,390
我小时候经常
Spent a lot of my childhood

333
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,000
往许愿池扔硬币  希望能有朋友
throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends.

334
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,330
到了某种程度  你就会开始玩花样
At a certain point, you start doing trick shots

335
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,030
好让这游戏不那么枯燥
just to keep things interesting.

336
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,390
等我喝完再投  等等
Whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.

337
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,770
那是我男朋友的声音
That'd be my boyfriend

338
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,190
宁愿和朋友玩无趣的星际迷航游戏
happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends

339
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,550
也不愿跟我一起出去
than hanging out with me.

340
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,850
-是大战  -什么
- Wars. - What?

341
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,870
是星际大战
Star Wars.

342
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,120
把这俩搞错的话  他们会大发雷霆的
They get all cranky when you mix the two up.

343
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,240
有什么区别吗
What's the difference?

344
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,650
绝对没区别
There's absolutely no difference.

345
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,400
怎样才能让他对我更好呢
How do I get him to treat me better?

346
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,890
好吧
All right.

347
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,030
我来给你上上女友基础课程吧
Let me give you a little girlfriend 101.

348
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,490
通常使出的第一招
Usually the first move out of the gate

349
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,420
不跟他滚床单
is you withhold sex,

350
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,500
但这招得等谢尔顿到青春期后才有用
but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty.

351
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,770
所以  我认为
So, I'd say...

352
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,690
对他采取不予理睬政策
give him the silent treatment.

353
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,020
不行  他爱死这样了
No, he loves that.

354
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,600
我们俩共处一个房间
Our record for sitting in a room together

355
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,410
但互相不讲话的记录是六个半小时
and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours.

356
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,280
他还说那晚他过得很开心
He said it was a magical evening.

357
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,000
好吧  那我们就只能采取
All right, then we're gonna have to go

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,340
最古老也最有效的那招了
with an oldie but goodie;

359
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,000
大吵大闹
making a scene.

360
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,490
这个我可不大擅长
I don't think I'd be good at that.

361
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,840
所以说有我这闺蜜你幸运死了
That's why you're lucky to have me.

362
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
在我家乡奥马哈  有餐厅不允许我进去
Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants

363
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,200
就是红辣椒饭店  我还被黑名单了两次
I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.

364
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,080
伯纳黛特  记住你是我们团的补血师
Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group.

365
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,010
你不能只给霍华德回血  要给大家回啊
You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.

366
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,370
我情不自禁嘛
I can't help it.

367
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,920
我的华仔小巫师受伤了呢
My Howie Wowie has an owie.

368
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,980
这真是我所听过的
That is the most sickeningly sweet thing

369
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,310
最恶心的甜言蜜语
I have ever experienced.

370
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,390
我正用"蜡烛糖"吸"酷A果汁"呢
And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.

371
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,120
谢尔顿·库珀  我有帐要跟你算
Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you,

372
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,950
我要当着你所有朋友的面算这笔帐
and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.

373
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,560
没错  跟他好好算账  算得他裤衩都保不住
Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!

374
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,060
我要当众羞辱你
I'm gonna publicly shame you,

375
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,700
然后我就坐等社会的压力
and then sit back as societal pressure

376
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,620
迫使你修正自己的行为
compels you to modify your behavior.

377
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,240
迎头痛击啊
Ooh, buuurn!

378
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,150
如果你以后还不对我好一点
And if you don't start treating me better,

379
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,760
我就跟你分手
I'm leaving you

380
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,140
然后跟小马农阿曼一起
for a miniature horse breeder named Armen.

381
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,550
哪个阿曼
Armen who?

382
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,600
阿文就是...见鬼
Armen... damn it.

383
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
谢尔顿  她想在家人面前炫耀一下你
Look, Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family,

384
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,580
你却放她鸽子  好吧
and you stood her up, okay?

385
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,270
看看她这可爱又伤感的表情
Look at this adorable, smushy face.

386
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,600
多伤感  多痛苦  多郁闷啊
Smush, smush, smush.

387
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
你弄痛我了
You're hurting me.

388
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,790
错  弄痛你的是谢尔顿
No, Sheldon hurt you.

389
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,110
之前他让我心痛  现在是你让我脸痛
Before; now it's you.

390
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,690
我明白了
I think I understand.

391
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,830
这世界上只有你一个
You're the one person

392
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,620
可以说谢尔顿·库珀是你男友
who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend,

393
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,010
但这话毕竟有些空洞
but that rings hollow

394
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,770
如果你不能让他亲自去证明
if you can't lord him over others in the flesh.

395
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,990
我忘了  我能让他们蓬荜生辉
I forget what I bring to the party

396
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,150
我走后  也会让他们怅然若失
and what I take away when I leave.

397
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,810
请接受这些珍贵的库珀优惠券
Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons...

398
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,760
就当补偿你吧
...as restitution.

399
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,410
谢尔顿  她才不要你这些傻不拉唧的...
Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid...

400
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,060
科学中心  现在使用
Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming.

401
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,030
出发吧
Let's go.

402
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,380
干得好  艾米·菲拉·福勒
Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler.

403
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,030
等我穿件外套
Let me get my coat.

404
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,390
长大点吧  莱纳德
Oh, grow up, Leonard.

405
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,150
各位打断一下
But e-excuse me,

406
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,830
我有话要说
I have something to say.

407
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,290
你们可能都没意识到
None of you may realize it,

408
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,780
但我真的很期待这个周末
but I was very much looking forward to this weekend.

409
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,350
就像回到了从前
It was gonna be like the old days--

410
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,890
在你们几个各自有女朋友之前
the four of us hanging out playing video games

411
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,860
我们四个聚在一起玩游戏
before you guys all got girlfriends.

412
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,100
你们到底知不知道
Do you have any idea what it's like

413
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,170
只有我一个人没女朋友  是什么心情呀
to be the only one without a girlfriend?

414
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,640
即使我哪天有了女友
Even if I get one someday,

415
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,020
我仍是最后一名  比谢尔顿还晚泡到妞
I'll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!

416
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,520
看  女人就是这么大吵大闹的
And that's how a girl makes a scene.

417
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,400
抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, sweetie.

418
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,050
你说得对  你该好好度周末
You're right. You deserve your weekend.

419
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,280
来吧艾米  我们走
Come on, Amy, let's go.

420
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
那科学中心什么时候能去啊
What about the Science Center?

421
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,250
我喝高呕吐的时候  让你搂着我头发
I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.

422
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,740
改天再去吧
Rain check.

423
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,560
我也该走了
I'm gonna go, too.

424
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,440
-我会想你的  -我才想你呢
- I'll miss you. - I'll miss you.

425
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,870
-我更想你  -我才更想...
- I'll miss you more. - No, I'll...

426
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,540
快走吧
Just leave!

427
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,060
好了
Okay, now.

428
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,010
本来就应该这样
This is the way it's supposed to be.

429
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,890
男人齐聚  共同杀敌
Men together, fighting the forces of evil.

430
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,300
说得对
Hear! Hear!

431
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,640
真不敢相信这一瓶只有64大卡
I can't believe this is only 64 calories.

432
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,960
霍华德·乔尔·沃罗威茨
Howard Joel Wolowitz!

433
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,740
我整整担心了你两天
I've been worried sick for two days,

434
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,260
我知道你把手机关了
and I know you turned off your phone!

435
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,490
马上给我开门
You open up this door right now

436
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,480
老娘都走到这来找你了
because I've had it up to here!

437
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,580
停尸房和医院我都找了一圈
I have been to the morgue and the hospital,

438
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,320
这该死的楼梯
and I spent the last half hour

439
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,220
让我爬了半个小时
walking up these ferkakta stairs!

440
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,030
老娘在召唤  我该走了
That's my ride; got to go.
