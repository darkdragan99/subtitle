1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,580
伯纳黛特  伴娘的礼服找得怎样了
So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,880
如果你不介意看上去像个
Well, if you don't mind looking like

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,850
橙色交通锥的话  已经找到了
an orange traffic cone, great.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,960
闺蜜们  我有办法解决礼服的问题
Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,880
真的吗
Really?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,130
十二年前  我表妹艾琳全家
12 years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,310
在她结婚前晚  全死于一场可怕的
died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,010
一氧化碳中毒事故
the night before her wedding.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
人间惨剧啊
That's horrible.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,360
这倒未必
Yes and no.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,530
那些还没被穿过的伴娘衣服
All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,690
咱们就能免费享用了
and available to us for free.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,630
只能说  大难全死
So it seems that cloud of odorless deadly gas

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,300
必有后福啊
had a silver lining after all.

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,790
你们看
Check it out,

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
都还在袋子里呢
still in the bags.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,520
不是说尸袋  是说礼服防尘袋
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,850
这个嘛
I don't know.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,580
穿死人剩的衣服不太好吧
Dead people's dresses?

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,880
是啊  而且那超短袖...
Yeah, and cap sleeve...

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,030
我还希望你们不会注意到呢
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,990
艾琳总对打折的服饰毫无抵抗力
Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes,

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,870
超短袖太冷  开暖气才一氧化碳中毒的
and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,090
女士们  自制啊
Ladies, please.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,640
这间屋子曾是一个智慧的集合地
These four walls once housed an intellectual salon

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,120
在这里  大脑和胃袋都能吸收到营养
where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,420
虽然没人有错
But through no one's fault,

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,790
佩妮
Penny,

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,400
但晚餐谈话的质量的确下滑了
the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,400
再次重申  这事谁都不怪
And again, I'm looking at no one in particular,

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,510
佩妮
Penny.

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,780
好吧
Fine.

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,830
那你想聊什么  谢尔顿
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
你居然问谢尔顿想聊什么
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

35
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,810
你何苦要逼死大家呢
Why do you hate us?

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,980
我准备了一些应该能同时吸引
I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to

37
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,710
高阶谈天霸  与低档聊天人的话题
both the advanced and novice conversationalists.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,630
你明显意有所指的瞄了我
Okay, that time you looked at me.

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,710
谁不想瞄你啊
Who didn't?

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,210
你的皮肤白璧无瑕
Your skin is like alabaster.

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,120
感觉根本没毛孔啊
Do you even have pores?

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,440
第一个话题
Topic one:

43
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,760
欧洲核子研究中心宣布超光速离子的存在
"Faster-than-light particles at CERN--

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,540
这是范式转换的新发现
paradigm-shifting discovery

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,520
还是像它们的乳酪一样千疮百孔的笑谈
or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese?"

46
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,970
开始高谈阔论吧
And converse.

47
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,390
好吧  谁想来
All right, who wants to go

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,190
我屋子里看看婚礼杂志
to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,220
我去看
Oh, me.

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,100
完全不怪任何人  谢尔顿  我们闪人了
Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving.

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,630
等等人家啦
Wait for moi.

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,420
你也要走吗
You're leaving?

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,230
谢尔顿  有时你忘记了我也是一名女士
Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,030
女人天生带一种雌激素  促使我们一边
and with that, comes with an oestrogen fuel need to page through

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,100
翻阅光鲜厚重的杂志  一边暗恨自己身材不佳
thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.

56
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,350
新话题:  女人们
New topice: women.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,960
讨人喜爱的谜女还是令人厌恶的八婆
Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,190
说得好
Totally.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,730
超短袖有哪里不好了
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

60
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,230
只要身形适合  穿起来超卡哇伊啊
If you have the right figure for it, they're adorable.

61
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,200
生活大爆炸第五季第八集

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,770
哟  艾米  什么风把你吹来这了
Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?

63
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,420
你们神经科学部门借了我朊病毒培养箱
Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,390
来协助我牛海绵状脑病的研究
for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

65
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,820
她是来讨一杯疯牛病
She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,530
把脑部退化疾病说得诙谐可不容易
It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious,

67
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,680
但你总能化正经为笑料
and yet somehow you do it.

68
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,070
餐桌上谈这个还"真"有意思啊
That's fun to have in a lunchroom.

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,570
真正的乐趣始于你能挑选
The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,050
任意小白鼠来注入病毒
you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,290
搞不好选中的就是那只老咬你的鼠妈妈
the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,980
拜托  我们在吃饭呢
Please, we're eating.

73
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,560
可不可以把那东西拿下桌
Can we get that off the table

74
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,710
然后换个话题聊啊
and change the subject?

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,430
换话题吗
Can we?

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,590
屏息以待吧
Stand back...

77
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,380
看哥怎么将聊天打屁升华到指点江山
while I turn this conversation into a "Conver-sensation."

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,270
这次完全是你自找的
This time, it's your fault.

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,910
我有一百个按字母顺序排列的话题  从
I have 100 alphabetized topics from

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,020

"Artichoke-- come on, people, it's just a giant thistle,"

81
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,180
到"《打鼾》:以鼾声为诗"
to "Zzz-- the onamona-poetry of sleep."

82
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,810
艾米  疯牛病毒得多久才弄得死我啊
Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?

83
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,770
我也不知道  四五年吧
I don't know, four or five years.

84
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,420
不行  远水救不了近火
No, it's not gonna do it.

85
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,220
伯纳黛特一直发给我
Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures

86
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,130
佩妮试伴娘礼服的照片
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,560
她们现在在逛街吗
They're out shopping right now?

88
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,490
是啊
Yeah.

89
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,810
只有她们两人吗
Just the two of them?

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,310
我想是吧
I guess.

91
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,880
很好  非常好
That's cool, that's cool.

92
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,260
她们为毛问我这种事情啊
Why are they asking me about this stuff?

93
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,260
哪个男人能知道鸡心领是什么玩意
What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?

94
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,960
莱纳德要终点前冲刺啦
Leonard's coming down the home stretch!

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,670
加油啊  马儿  你能行的
Come on, horsey, you can do this!

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,540
该死  拜托  大腿肌肉  你也能行
Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this!

97
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,900
太棒了  冠军
Yes! First place.

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,890
我肯定能当一名好骑士  要不是小时候太高...
I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall.

99
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,920
和害怕马的话
and scared of horses.

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,020
谢尔顿  该你了
Sheldon, you're up.

101
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,820
什么
What?

102
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,730
快点  该你了
Come on, it's your turn.

103
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,550
我们说好要呼吸新鲜空气的
We said we'd get more fresh air.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,790
抱歉  我有点心烦意乱
Sorry. I'm a little distracted.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,730
我联系不到艾米了
I can't seem to get in touch with Amy.

106
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,700
不管是发邮件  邀请视频
I tried e-mail, video chat,

107
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,010
在推特上找她  或在她主页上留言
tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall,

108
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,610
发短信  都没用
texting her, nothing.

109
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,970
你打过她家里电话吗
Did you try calling her on the telephone?

110
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,900
对呀  打座机
The telephone.

111
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,690
莱纳德  在你的简单世界里
You know, Leonard, in your own simple way,

112
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,090
你是个举世无双的天才
you may be the wisest of us all.

113
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,460
语音信箱
Voice mail.

114
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,680
真是奇了怪了
Curiouser and curiouser.

115
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,230
要是你不放心  我们可以过去
If you're worried, we can go over there

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,510
看看她是否有事
and see if she's all right.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,650
好吧
Okay.

118
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,450
话说我看到一条新闻
You know, I heard in the news

119
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,620
她家那一带有人目击山猫出没
a bobcat has been spotted in her neighborhood.

120
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,920
艾米很安全  不会被山猫吃掉的
I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

121
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,780
谁说艾米被山猫吃掉了
Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?

122
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,020
你呀
You do?

123
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,050
莱纳德  我不过是说说当地新闻
Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item.

124
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,570
都怪你  害我开始担心艾米被山猫吃掉了
Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

125
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,360
就忘了山猫这档事吧
Forget about the bobcat.

126
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,860
你猛提山猫  谁忘得掉啊
How can I? You won't stop talking about it!

127
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,300
*世间伤心事*
*Everybody hurts*

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,080
*时有心伤*
*Sometimes*

129
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,150
*惟见泪千行*
*Everybody cries*

130
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,390
*世间伤心事*
*Everybody hurts*

131
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,540
*时有心伤*
*Sometimes.*

132
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,170
她哭哭啼啼的
She sounds weepy.

133
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,870
我讨厌人家哭哭啼啼  咱们走吧
I don't like weepy. Let's go.

134
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,140
她可是你朋友
She's your friend.

135
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,280
爷们点
Step up.

136
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,430
艾米  艾米  艾米
Amy. Amy. Amy.

137
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,780
撤了
Bye.

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,950
你要去哪
Where are you going?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,660
爷我是单身  不用搅和这破事
I'm single, I don't need this crap.

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,200
谢尔顿  你来做什么
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

141
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,440
我和你的电子通信
You didn't respond to

142
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,500
你全都没回应
any of my electronic communications.

143
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,880
我想一个人待着
I wanted to be alone.

144
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,940
你想聊聊吗
Would you like to talk about it?

145
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,940
友情提醒  想回答"不想说"可别客气
And keep in mind that "No" is a perfectly viable answer.

146
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,310
谢尔顿  我的世界要崩溃了
Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,310
按照程序
Point of order.

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,790
因为你不开心  按照惯例
As you're in distress, it would be customary

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,100
我该给你倒杯热饮
for me to offer you a hot beverage.

150
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,750
但我是你的客人
But I'm a guest in your home,

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,600
按照惯例  你该给我倒杯饮料
so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage.

152
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,010
你想要怎么来面对面互倒饮料呀
How do you want to proceed vis-à-vis beverages?

153
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,390
无所谓
It doesn't matter.

154
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,170
都无所谓了
Nothing matters.

155
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,230
如果你想聊别的  不谈这事
If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you,

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,320
坊间传言  有人目击这附近有山猫出没
uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.

157
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,300
佩妮和伯纳黛特没叫我
Penny and Bernadette went shopping

158
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,560
就自己去买伴娘礼服了
for bridesmaids dresses without me.

159
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,790
这让你...
And that made you feel...

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
不开心吗
sad?

161
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,270
是的
Yes.

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
我就知道
I knew it.

163
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,130
继续说
Just keep going.

164
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,910
我好像还挺会读心啊
I guess I'm good at this.

165
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,150
我以为她们是喜欢和我一起玩的
It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me,

166
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,620
原来我只是自己骗自己
but I guess I was fooling myself.

167
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,350
是不是她们来你家的时候
When they were over here,

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,040
你没给人家倒饮料啊
did you fail to offer them a beverage?

169
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,660
某些人对这事很在意很不爽
'Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw.

170
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,630
谢尔顿  我想请你做件事
Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something,

171
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,660
希望你不要用异样眼光看待
and I'd like you to keep an open mind.

172
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,100
一贯如此
Always.

173
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,850
此时此刻  我很渴望
At this moment, I find myself

174
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,290
与人有亲密行为和肢体接触
craving human intimacy and physical contact.

175
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,790
亲娘咧
Oh, boy.

176
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,730
你知道我们的关系仅限于精神层面
You know ours is a relationship of the mind.

177
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,630
我提议
Proposal.

178
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,670
咱俩一夜激情  大战数千回合
One wild night of torrid lovemaking

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,290
既能抚慰我心  也令我胯下湿热
that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.

180
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,070
反提议
Counterproposal.

181
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,880
我会轻轻地梳你的头
I will gently stroke your head

182
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,490
然后反复地说  "谁是乖乖艾米宝贝啊"
and repeat, "aw, who's a good Amy""

183
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,290
那这样如何
How about this?

184
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,530
法式热吻  七分钟的巅峰体验
French kissing-- seven minutes in heaven

185
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,170
在你上我二垒后划下句点
culminating in second base.

186
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,220
我帮你揉脖子
Neck massage...

187
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,670
然后你给我倒杯饮料
...then you get me that beverage.

188
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,890
我们抱一下  不商量了
We cuddle. Final offer.

189
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,950
好吧
Very well.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,330
真要命
Oh, boy.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,720
我就说说  二垒你触手可得...
I'm just saying, second base is right there.

192
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,020
我在考虑给自己搞个另类造型
Mm, I'm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation,

193
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,150
比如弄个烟斗  单片眼镜
like a pipe or a monocle

194
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,250
或是翘八字胡
or a handlebar mustache.

195
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,600
给外面那些满脑子想钓
For all those girls out there

196
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,390
印度钻石王老五一个明确的目标吗
looking for the Indian Monopoly man?

197
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,260
这国家太危险了
This is not a safe place.

198
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,990
什么东西都不能露白
You can't share anything here.

199
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
你们两个  给哥管好你们的女人
The two of you need to get your women in line!

200
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,220
啥
What?

201
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,340
昨一整晚  我被强迫
Last night I was strong-armed

202
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,650
听那烦人的竖琴
into an evening of harp music

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,150
还得让情绪化的艾米·法拉·福勒熊抱
and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler.

204
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,310
本来那天晚上
This on a night

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
我是计划好要解决
that I had originally designated for solving

206
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,590
更高自旋引力场下的时空几何问题
the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity

207
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,500
以及搭乐高死星的呢
and building my Lego Death Star.

208
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,850
结果因为你们的马子  佩妮和伯纳黛特
And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette,

209
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
偷偷跑去买婚礼垃圾  也不叫上艾米
went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy,

210
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,860
她们完全没有想过
an action they took with no thought or regard

211
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,570
她们会影响到我  影响弦理论的未来
as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory

212
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,540
还影响我的乐高欢乐时光
or my Lego fun time!

213
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,140
那你想我们怎么办呢
What do you want us to do about it?

214
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,360
你显然没仔细听我的主题句
You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence:

215
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,480
管好你们的女人
Get your women in line!

216
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,930
叫她们去跟艾米道歉  把关系修复好
You make them apologize to Amy and set things right.

217
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,820
我是个搞科研的人  不是某人的抱抱兔
I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!

218
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,760
为什么要我去跟佩妮谈
Why do I have to talk to Penny?

219
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,070
她又不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

220
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
四年前是你请她过来吃午饭的
You invited her to lunch four years ago.

221
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,250
她的事全怪你  你给我搞定她
Everything about her is on you; you make it so!

222
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,610
-木须肉是佩妮的  -谢谢
- Moo-shu is Penny. - Thank you.

223
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,600
谢尔顿呢
Where's Sheldon?

224
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,870
他昨晚熬夜了
He was up late last night,

225
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,330
我提早喂他食  哄他睡觉了
so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.

226
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,890
你真是体贴
That's so sweet.

227
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,670
不过明天一大早  他就会起床闹着玩了
Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.

228
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,640
其实呢
So, listen, guys,

229
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,170
他昨晚之所以熬夜是因为
the reason he was up late is because he was

230
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,580
他要照顾艾米
taking care of Amy.

231
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,240
她有点伤心
She's kind of upset.

232
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,070
为什么
Why?

233
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
她的感情有点受伤  因为你们
Her feelings got hurt because you guys

234
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,830
没叫她一起去逛街
went dress shopping without her.

235
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
我跟你说了她会不高兴
I told you that would happen.

236
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,820
这是她第一次做伴娘
Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid

237
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,910
她有点兴奋过头了
and she's just getting a little crazy with it.

238
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,820
她老是不停地说不同文化里的伴娘习俗
She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions

239
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,400
而且都是得脱得光溜溜
in other cultures, and they're all about

240
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,370
互相给对方搓澡的那种
getting naked and washing each other.

241
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,270
对  她还老想知道
Yeah, and she keeps trying

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,110
我们的月经有没有同步
to figure out if our cycles have synced up

243
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,690
我们才能自诩为"三个同经手"
so we can call ourselves "The three menstra-teers"
仿三个火枪手

244
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,160
我们以为不叫她
We thought it would be easier

245
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,710
一起去逛礼服会比较省事
to look at dresses one time without her.

246
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,970
我感觉好内疚
I feel terrible.

247
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,720
我也内疚  我们会找她谈
I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her.

248
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,500
等等
Hey, wait,

249
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,160
她怎么知道的
how did she find out?

250
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,830
拉杰告的密
Raj did it.

251
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,970
他说下次还会揭你们的短
And he says he would do it again.

252
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,550
好吧  对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

253
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,430
你给我发照片  我当时没多想就说漏嘴了
You sent me the picture; I wasn't thinking.

254
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,050
-华仔  -别这样  平时
- Oh, Howie. - Well, hey, I'm usually

255
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,570
我的嘴巴还是挺严的
pretty good at not blabbing.

256
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
你跟我说了那么多他们的事
You tell me tons of stuff about these guys,

257
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,380
我从来都没说出去
and I never repeat it.

258
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,680
-你跟他说什么了  -没说啥
- What do you tell him? - Oh,

259
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,180
就一些枕边的私房话
you know, just pillow talk.

260
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,340
你们什么都不用担心
You guys have nothing to worry about.

261
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,960
咱两相好时  你没跟人家说啥吧
Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?

262
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,840
没有  你的小秘密我都没说过
No. All your little secrets are fine.

263
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,150
是啊  她绝对没说
Yes, absolutely fine.

264
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,450
我迟些再告诉你
I'll tell you later.

265
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,440
来吧  肿瘤
Come on, tumor.

266
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,540
来吧  肿瘤  老娘要的就是扩散的小恶性胶质瘤
Come on, tumor, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma.

267
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,470
爽啊  脑瘤
Yay, brain tumor!

268
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,010
你得知有脑瘤时的反映估计跟我不一样
Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.

269
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,160
-嗨  -你好
- Hi. - Hello.

270
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,710
你们怎么来了
What are you doing here?

271
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
我们是来道歉的
Well, look, we just wanted to apologize

272
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,130
那天没叫上你一起去逛礼服
for not bringing you with us the other day.

273
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,960
没必要道歉  这就跟《芝麻街》里说的一样
That's not necessary-- it's like Sesame Street says:

274
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,820
"这个东西跟与众不同"
"One of these things is not like the other,

275
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,720
"这个东西将孤独终老"
one of these things should die alone."

276
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,020
别这样嘛  艾米  让我们补偿你
Come on, Amy, let us make it up to you.

277
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,080
咱们办个闺蜜之夜
We'll have a girl's night;

278
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,280
你想干啥咱就干啥
we'll do whatever you want.

279
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,870
我们可以去韩国洗浴中心
We can go down to the Korean baths

280
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,400
照你说的那样
and do that thing you were talking about

281
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,130
互相给对方搓澡
where we wash each other.

282
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,280
戴着丝瓜络手套搓  不是用手摸
With-with loofah mitts, no hands.

283
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,600
没关系  我很高兴发生这样的事
It's okay. I'm glad this happened.

284
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,870
我再也不用假装某个美女
I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl

285
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,460
和她找准角度还算可爱的朋友
and her cute-in-the-right-light friend

286
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,020
喜欢和我一起玩了
want to hang out with me.

287
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,710
艾米  我们真的很抱歉
Amy, we're really sorry.

288
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,220
对  我们觉得特内疚
Yeah, we feel awful.

289
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,930
别  我会没事的  你们也不是第一个
Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls

290
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,190
我以为是我的朋友  结果处处躲着我的女孩子
I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me.

291
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,790
感觉就像回到了小学  初中
It's like elementary school, junior high,

292
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,370
高中  大学  研究院
high school, undergrad, grad school,

293
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,100
还有去挪威交换的那学期一样
and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
别这样嘛  艾米
Oh, come on, Amy.

295
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,600
你不懂
You don't get it.

296
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,830
看看这个大脑
Look at this brain.

297
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,070
我实在不想看
I don't really want to.

298
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,590
这就像我们
This is us.

299
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,590
伯纳黛特  你就是善于
Bernadette, you are the analytical,

300
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,240
科学分析的左脑
scientific left hemisphere.

301
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,430
佩妮  你就是有自主创造力的右脑
Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere.

302
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,100
艾米在哪呢
And where's Amy?

303
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,410
她在这里  可怜的小肿瘤
She's right here-- the sad little tumor

304
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,120
没人愿意跟她一起去逛街
no one wants to go dress shopping with.

305
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,380
艾米  你不是肿瘤
Amy, you're not a tumor.

306
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,640
佩妮  告诉她她不是肿瘤
Penny, tell her she's not a tumor.

307
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,820
你知道亚历山大·格拉汉姆·贝尔
Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell

308
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,520
发明电话时
invented the telephone,

309
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,210
他提议接电话时说"啊嘿"吗
he proposed answering it with "Ahoy"?

310
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,800
啊嘿[Ahoy]  海盗或船员常用的打招呼语

311
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,660
啊嘿
Ahoy.

312
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,030
我喜欢
I like it.

313
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,180
艾米  是你吗
Amy? Is that you?

314
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,920
你喝酒啦
Have you been drinking?

315
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,030
你说什么  没我屁屁个错...
I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

316
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,560
好吧  我们这就去
Well, all right. We're on our way.

317
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,840
怎么了
What's going on?

318
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,000
艾米在一家贩酒店的停车场喝得烂醉
It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.

319
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,430
真的吗  艾米
Really? Amy?

320
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,300
莱纳德  你该庆幸自己留不住女人
Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman.

321
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,100
她们真是难搞
They are a handful.

322
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,520
看哪
Oh, look.

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,060
是小谢和小莱驾到
It's Sheldon and little Leonard.

324
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,520
嗨  小莱
Hi, little Leonard.

325
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,010
嗨  艾米
Hi, Amy.

326
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,470
嗨  小"抱"贝
Hey, Cuddles.

327
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,590
小"抱"贝
Cuddles?

328
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,450
对  小"抱"贝  我们抱过了
Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled.

329
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,990
少幼稚的猛问了  莱纳德
Grow up, Leonard.

330
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,910
艾米  你在这干嘛
Amy, what are you doing here?

331
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,170
我来这买酒
I came here to get a bottle of wine

332
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,960
佩妮教过我  借酒浇愁
like Penny taught me to do when you're sad.

333
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,910
是啊  但你怎么不回家喝
Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?

334
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,530
你没上过中学吗  莱纳德
Didn't you go to high school, Leonard?

335
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,450
酷小孩都在停车场鬼混
Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out.

336
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,810
虽然那些王八蛋从没邀请过我来
Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.

337
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,790
我们还是带你回家吧
Maybe we should get you home.

338
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,500
等等  等等  谢尔顿
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon,

339
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,410
要怎么样你才肯去隔壁
what would it take for you to go into that liquor store,

340
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,910
买一瓶烈酒
buy a bottle of hooch,

341
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,180
然后带我去街对面那家旅馆
take me across the street to that motel,

342
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,040
跟我大搞特搞一番呢
and have your way with me?

343
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,210
是啊  谢尔顿  你要怎样才肯
Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?

344
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,950
我求求你们了  快走吧
I'm begging both of you, please, let's go.

345
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,280
好吧
Okay.

346
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,350
来吧
Come on.

347
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,110
起来没事啦
Upsy-daisy.

348
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,670
终于有人碰我二垒了
Ooh, finally someone found second base.

349
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,770
我懂你的痛
I know how you feel.

350
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,440
我的大脑前庭也像被刀子划过一样
I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.

351
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,880
找我干嘛
What do you want?

352
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,300
是要我把友谊手镯还给你吗
Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?

353
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,960
我没给过你友谊手镯
I never gave you a friendship bracelet.

354
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,940
我们刚认识时我做了一个  假装是你给我的
When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me.

355
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,770
你要的话  我可以还给你
You can have it back if you want.

356
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,310
不  你给自己做的  我想你好好留着
No, you made that for you; I want you to have it.

357
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,530
我们知道你很伤心  你完全有理由伤心
We know you're upset, and you have every right to be,

358
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,760
如果可以  请再给我们一个机会
but if it's okay with you, we'd like a second chance

359
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,110
纠正我们的错误
to make things right.

360
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,660
我们真的很抱歉
We are really sorry,

361
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,760
我们想努力向你表达
and we were trying to think of some way to show you

362
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,650
我们有多在乎你
how much we care about you.

363
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,360
所以
Which is why

364
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,280
如果你能当我婚礼的首席伴娘
it would mean so much if you would agree

365
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,240
那就真是太好了
to be the maid of honor at my wedding.

366
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,270
什么  等等  这是什么恶作剧吗
What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke?

367
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,070
就像在挪威  我所谓的"朋友"
Like in Norway, when my "Friends"

368
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,300
骗我跟发情的水獭洗桑拿那样吗
trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?

369
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,500
不  我真的想请你当我的首席伴娘
No. I-I want you to be the maid of honor.

370
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,180
我的天哪
Oh, my gosh.

371
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,100
都没有人请我当过首席伴娘呢
No one's every asked me to be the maid of honor before.

372
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,390
哦  不对
Well, that's not true.

373
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,650
有过一次  不过她们都死了
Once, but then they all died.

374
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,000
这么说你答应啦
So is that a yes?

375
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,340
答应  当然答应
Yes. Yes.

376
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,400
老天哪
Oh, my gosh,

377
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,770
我有太多事要做了
I-I have so much to do.

378
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,890
要准备新娘婚前派对和单身女郎派对
There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party.

379
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,540
单身女郎派对要做什么好呢
What should we do for the bachelorette party?

380
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,560
我知道了  我们去印第安人的蒸汗屋
Oh, I know-- we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge,

381
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,450
带上龙舌兰酒  去烂泥里打滚
we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud,

382
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,470
接着在伯纳黛特裸体上画生育符号
and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body.

383
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
终于要去做这事了
So that's happening.

384
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,330
是啊  当然  真好
Yeah, sure, sure.

385
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,960
拉斯维加斯也很好玩啊
Vegas is fun, too.

386
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,130
我有种想哭的冲动
I feel like crying.

387
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
当然  可能只是荷尔蒙作祟
Of course, I could just be hormonal.

388
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,140
等等  说不定我们的月经终于同步了
Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up.

389
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,040
伯纳黛特你快到了吗
Bernadette?

390
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,130
没有吗  佩妮呢
No? Penny?

391
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,800
-抱歉  -真的吗
- Sorry. - Really?

392
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,770
好啦  是到了
Okay, yeah.

393
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,830
太好了
Yay!

394
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,440
首席伴娘艾米·菲拉·福勒的
Maid of honor Amy Farrah Fowler's

395
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,650
婚礼录像之"精彩幕后故事"
amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video,

396
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,820
片段一

397
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,490
我们只是在试衣服
We're just trying on dresses--

398
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,390
真的要拍吗
do we really need to record this?

399
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,110
抱歉  你是首席伴娘吗
I'm sorry, are you the maid of honor?

400
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,760
我是新娘
I am the bride.

401
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,890
所以你不是  开拍
So no. And action.

402
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,170
觉得怎样
What do you think?

403
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,910
我喜欢
I love it!

404
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,300
这身什么啊  尼姑装吗
What are you, a nun?

405
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,180
拜托  闺蜜  露点肉肉嘛
Come on, bestie, let's see some skin.

406
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,580
艾米  真性感
Amy! Looking sexy!

407
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,900
你以为这里没镜子的吗
You think they don't have mirrors in there?

408
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,400
我当然知道自己有多美
I know how I look.

409
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,020
伯纳黛特  你真是太美了
Bernadette, you look beautiful!

410
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,360
-是很美  -谢谢
- You do. - Thank you.

411
